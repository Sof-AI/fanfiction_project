      <p>Greetings, one and all, to my latest excursion into “how long a fic can I write before my brain explodes”? In this case, an Avatar: The Last Airbender fusion seemed like a good choice to fuck around and find out!</p><p>(Seriously, this fic is going to be an absolute monster. It’s going to cover all three seasons of A:TLA although obviously it’ll be more AU in some places than in others. Even so. Long. You have been warned.)</p><p>((Because of how long it will be, there’s some characters and pairings that aren’t going to appear until WAY later in the fic, so I’m going to say here and now that this is going to be mainly Wangxian with some Chengqing and a little light Nielan but that won’t be until season three or so. IDEK. Please send help.))</p><p>For most of my fusions, I’ll say that knowledge of the other material is unnecessary, but this is one of the few where I will say it would definitely be helpful if you have seen A:TLA. It’s a very rich, detailed world, and I haven’t bothered to put in lots of explanations because there’s just so much. Also, if you haven’t seen A:TLA, you should go watch it anyway. So do that and then come back. XD</p>

    <p>
  <span>Jiang Yanli hummed softly to herself as she baited another hook and dipped it over the side of the boat, then handed the rod to her brother. Or at least, she tried to hand the rod to her brother. Jiang Cheng wasn’t looking at her, and didn’t notice. He was preoccupied with keeping the small bubble of water moving back and forth between his hands. “A-Cheng,” Jiang Yanli said, her voice gently reproving. “We’re supposed to be getting dinner, not practicing waterbending.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Easy for you to say,” Jiang Cheng said, with his typical scowl. “You’re not the one who has to master waterbending without a teacher.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jiang Yanli sighed quietly. She knew that things weren’t easy for Jiang Cheng. He had only been eight years old when their father had been killed, and he had become the last waterbender in their tribe. With their mother and the warriors all gone, fighting far away, he was the tribe’s only defense. Their mother’s parting words hadn’t helped, either; she had departed with a sour, “I expect you to have mastered the basics at least by the time I get back.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nobody knew when that would be. Her departure had been two years previous, and although the tribe got letters from their warrior family members occasionally, they never got one from Yu Ziyuan. Instead, they got lists of instructions and orders. She never inquired as to their health or happiness, but only told them what she expected they were doing in her absence.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So she couldn’t blame Jiang Cheng for the fact that he took the duty of learning waterbending extremely seriously. But the problem was, he didn’t really know much. He had no teachers, and the fire nation had destroyed all the books on the subject. All he could really do was learn by trial and error, and over the years he had grown angry about the fact that it was much, much more error than not.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The letters from the front sometimes hurt more than they helped. Jiang Cheng wanted to be fighting alongside his people. His mother’s rejection of his repeated offers seemed personal to him, even though intellectually they knew it wasn’t. He was the last waterbender of the southern water tribe. He had to be protected until he could master waterbending. The war had stretched on almost a hundred years, and the southern water tribe had nearly been wiped out in the initial attacks, as the fire nation searched for the avatar. They had rebounded once or twice, only to be decimated again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As for the rest of the world, they had their own problems. Nobody could be spared to go look after a ragtag tribe at the southernmost reaches of the world. Jiang Yanli knew that some people blamed them for the loss of the avatar a hundred years ago. He had been a boy in the southern water tribe, but just after the fire nation’s first attacks, he had vanished. Whether or not he had died, nobody knew. Most people assumed he hadn’t – after all, if he had died, another one would have been reborn. Some assumed he had fled his responsibilities and gone to live as a hermit. Many thought he had been captured and was being held by the fire nation to this day, as avatars were known to have extremely long lives. Whatever the outcome, they could not help but blame the southern water tribe for having lost him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, I wonder if I can – ” Jiang Cheng leaned over the boat suddenly, and Jiang Yanli had to fight to keep it steady. He took off his gloves and made a few circular motions over the water. A few moments later, a large bubble of water with a fish still swimming inside rose over the surface and then over their boat. “Look! A-jie, I caught one!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s amazing, A-Cheng!” Jiang Yanli said, thrilled both for her brother and because it meant they could go home and eat sooner. “Oh, imagine how many you could catch like that, it’s so – ”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jiang Cheng tried to lower it into the boat. They were suddenly caught in a current, and one of his hands went automatically to grip the side of the boat to steady himself. The bubble of water immediately dissolved and the fish flopped to the floor of the boat, then bounced back into the water.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Damn it!” Jiang Cheng shouted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah, A-Cheng, don’t be so upset,” Jiang Yanli said. “You can catch another, I’m sure – oh!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The current had picked up, and was carrying their boat further. No matter how much they tried to steer, they couldn’t get free of it. Small icebergs began to crash around them, and all they could do was hold on for dear life.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A few moments later, they slammed up against a huge iceberg and nearly lost their boat entirely. The only upside was that the current finally released them back into calmer waters.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ugh, why does nothing ever go right?” Jiang Cheng groaned, taking off his coat and trying to wring it out. “I knew we shouldn’t have gone so far out. How are we even going to get home now?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A-Cheng, it’s going to be fine,” Jiang Yanli said firmly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s not! It’s never fine!” Jiang Cheng made a slashing motion with one hand. Behind them, there was a cracking noise in the iceberg. “No matter what I try to do, it never goes right. Mom could come home any day and I barely know how to waterbend at all!” Another slash, another crack. “She’s going to be furious with me and what am I going to say? I should be a master by now, considering how great Dad was – ”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re waterbending right now!” Jiang Yanli said, her eyes widening as the iceberg continued to crack open further.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re just trying to make me feel better,” Jiang Cheng snapped, and with a final emphatic gesture, the iceberg cracked open entirely. The boat went flying backwards on a gust of wind, and they nearly fell out of it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A-Cheng,” Jiang Yanli said, once it had settled, and gestured to the iceberg.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jiang Cheng’s eyes were wide. “I did that?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You most assuredly did!” Jiang Yanli said, and she was about to say something else when one of the remaining chunks of ice began to glow. She gasped and clutched at Jiang Cheng’s sleeve despite herself. As the chunk of ice came closer, she saw something astonishing – the shadow of a person inside, giving off that bright glow. “Oh my goodness! A-Cheng, there’s somebody in there!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So what?” Jiang Cheng asked, returning to his usual demeanor of annoyed. “He must be frozen solid.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jiang Yanli had to agree, except at that moment, she saw the person’s eyes open. The glow became even brighter. “Oh no – I think he’s alive! We have to get him out. A-Cheng, make those slashing motions again – I think they broke the ice.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Looking somewhat dubious, Jiang Cheng nonetheless did as instructed, and even managed to direct it somewhat so the ice sheared away from the figure inside. A few moments later, there was a massive crash as most of the ice fell away, and the figure inside floated out, gently landing in their boat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a boy, looking around the same age as Jiang Cheng, perhaps a year or two older. He was dressed in water tribe clothes, and Jiang Yanli even recognized some of the patterns – not just any tribe, <em>her</em> tribe. His hood was back, and his long dark hair was done in the traditional style of the southern water tribe, with the front pulled back and a braid on each side.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She caught him as he collapsed, while Jiang Cheng looked on with a worried frown. The boy’s eyes flickered, then opened. “You . . .” he murmured.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re safe now,” she assured him. “Try to take it easy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He blinked a few more times, then said, in a voice altogether too normal and easy-going for someone who just came out of an iceberg, “Will you go penguin sledding with me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah – ” Jiang Yanli was taken aback, but then smiled. She hadn’t gone penguin sledding in years. Who <em>was</em> this boy? People from their tribe went missing occasionally, usually falling to predators or the elements, but she had never heard of anyone this age disappearing. And how had he gotten in the ice? How was he still alive?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>She didn’t want to hammer him with questions, but Jiang Cheng had no such reservations, immediately asking, “Who are you? How did you get in the ice? Are you a fire nation spy?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Am I a what?” the boy asked, blinking as he got to his feet. He brushed some fragments of ice off his coat, then looked around as if trying to figure out where he was. “Ah – your boat is sinking!” he said, and hastily waved his arms, a strange circular motion Jiang Yanli had never seen before. The water around their boat immediately went smooth and still, freezing into a solid sheet of ice before their boat could be lost entirely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jiang Yanli gasped with delight. “You’re a waterbender!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure am,” he said, grinning. “Oh – my name is Wei Ying, courtesy Wuxian.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m Jiang Yanli,” she said. “This is my brother, Jiang Cheng, courtesy Wanyin.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nice to meet you!” Wei Wuxian said, still cheerful. “I don’t think that boat is going to be seaworthy to get you home, to be honest, but I can help you get there if you want.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How’d you get in the ice?” Jiang Cheng repeated, not willing to accept his offer. “Why aren’t you frozen?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I really don’t know,” Wei Wuxian said. “The last thing I remember is going into the water . . . I guess I must have frozen myself somehow. So you want help with the boat?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’d be so grateful,” Jiang Yanli said, and shot her brother a look. He sighed but agreed. “Maybe you could show A-Cheng some moves! He hasn’t had a teacher so he doesn’t know much yet.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, are you a waterbender too?” Wei Wuxian asked. “Sure! Hop on board.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Looking like he was about to be marched to the gallows, Jiang Cheng got on the boat. “I am a waterbender, but I don’t need anyone’s help,” he said, and Jiang Yanli gave him an exasperated look.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wei Wuxian didn’t seem bothered. He only said, “Okay,” and then melted the ice around the boat. It immediately began to sink again, but he created a wave that began to carry them along on top of it. They went quite fast, and Jiang Yanli gave another gasp and grabbed at the side of the boat. “Oh, sorry,” Wei Wuxian said, and slowed them down a little. “So are you guys from the South Pole?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jiang Yanli nodded. “What about you? Where are you from?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Same,” he said. He was frowning faintly, clearly trying to puzzle something out. “If you don’t mind my asking, who are your parents? One of them must have been a waterbender, right?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Another nod. “Jiang Fengmian.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Huh. I didn’t know him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jiang Yanli frowned, thinking things over. She couldn’t fathom how Wei Wuxian could still be alive after having been frozen in ice, but she was starting to have a vague suspicion. “Jiang Fengmian was the son of Jiang Mashou, who was the son of Jiang Zhuyin, who was the son of Jiang Songlin – ”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah! I knew Jiang Songlin! I – ” Wei Wuxian stopped abruptly. “Really?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Staring hard at him, Jiang Cheng nodded. “How long were you in that ice?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wei Wuxian looked away. “Ah . . . the year I went in was the same year the fire nation first attacked, if that helps at all . . .”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jiang Yanli could not help but gasp. “Wei-gongzi, that – that was a hundred years ago! Were you truly in the ice for a hundred years?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I guess so?” Wei Wuxian didn’t sound very certain. “I don’t know . . . but I know that they attacked me and I went into the water, and I know that Jiang Songlin was one of my best friends . . .”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey, if you were around back then, do you know what happened to the avatar?” Jiang Cheng suddenly asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wei Wuxian looked like he had been hit in the face with a board. “Um . . .”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jiang Yanli looked between her brother and Wei Wuxian. It seemed obvious to her. The avatar had vanished a hundred years ago. Wei Wuxian had frozen himself solid in ice a hundred years ago. The avatar was a waterbender from the southern water tribe who had been, according to the history, seventeen when he vanished. Wei Wuxian was a waterbender from the southern water tribe who looked like he was about seventeen. She decided not to say anything. It was up to Wei Wuxian whether or not he wanted to admit it, and she was somewhat curious about whether or not he would.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Wei Wuxian finally said. “I mean, I knew people that knew him, but I didn’t know him. He was off fighting the fire nation when I went into the ice.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Jiang Cheng said. He sounded a little disappointed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a long trip back, and by the end of it, Wei Wuxian was exhausted. Jiang Yanli didn’t know much about the prolonged use of bending, but he had carried them on the wave for over an hour. As soon as the boat was on solid land, he practically fell asleep standing up. She and Jiang Cheng ushered him over to their little house and found some dry clothes for him. He was asleep before they could finish bundling him into the blankets.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t trust him,” Jiang Cheng finally said. “We don’t know where he came from, and he couldn’t have really survived a hundred years in the ice. He’s probably just pretending to know our great-grandfather so we’ll trust him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jiang Yanli sighed. “I’ll admit I have questions about him that I don’t have answers to yet, but I don’t think he’s a danger to us, A-Cheng. Let’s get some rest. It was a long day.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>~ ~ ~ ~</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wei Wuxian woke up with a gasp from a dream where the raging storm waters were going over his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wei-gongzi, you’re all right,” a soft voice said, and he looked around. He was on the inside of an igloo, just like the one he had grown up in. The young woman there was the same one he had met yesterday, with the most beautiful, gentlest smile he had ever seen. “You were having a bad dream, I think.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah.” Wei Wuxian sat up, rubbing both hands over his face. He stretched experimentally. His body felt good. No aftereffects of having been frozen solid. He didn’t remember a conscious decision to do that, and he wished he did. The last thing he remembered was the fire nation troops knocking him off the iceberg he had been using for transport, and the waves closing over him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Had it really been a hundred years? It seemed impossible. Just yesterday he had been fighting the fire nation troops. Just last week he had gotten the word that his village had been attacked, and he had abandoned his battles in the Earth Kingdom to run home and find the devastation the Fire Nation had wreaked there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He should have listened to the elders. They had told him that he wasn’t ready to fight, that he needed to focus on learning all the elements before taking on the Fire Nation, but he hadn’t listened. Too cocky, too arrogant, too bullheaded –</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on, the village is waiting to meet you,” Jiang Yanli said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wei Wuxian dreaded it more than he wanted to let on, but he got out of bed and followed her outside.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he had been young, the South Pole had been a city populated by thousands of people. When he had been the Avatar, the Fire Nation had reduced it to rubble, but he knew some of his people had survived. He didn’t doubt that the Fire Nation would have attacked it again – probably looking for him, with no idea he was frozen solid miles away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even knowing that, he could not help but cringe when Jiang Yanli led him outside. This could barely be called a village. Three igloos and some tents. Nine adults – many of them elderly – and a large handful of children who would have been too young to fight. Could this really be all that was left?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jiang Yanli introduced him, then said, “Wei-gongzi is a waterbender – he’ll be able to teach A-Cheng!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I told you, I don’t need anyone to teach me,” Jiang Cheng snapped. “Before she left, Mom told me to master it, and she knew there were no other benders here, so she obviously thought I could do it on my own!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wei Wuxian perked up. “Left? So there are other tribe members?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jiang Cheng glowered at him, but nodded. “Two years ago, the warriors left to join the fight in the Earth Kingdom. My mother left me in charge of the village, and I don’t need anyone’s help to do it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay,” Wei Wuxian said, because Jiang Cheng seemed incredibly angry and he wasn’t sure why, but didn’t want to get involved.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>What was he going to do now? The war that had just been starting when he had been told he was the avatar was still ongoing. Should he rejoin it? Part of him said yes, but that part of him flushed with shame when he thought of how he had behaved back then. The elders had told him to master the elements first. That was what he should focus on now, although how he would find anyone who could teach him firebending when they were at war with the Fire Nation was beyond him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He could stay a day or two in this village while he rested up, and then he would head for the southern air temple. It would be closest, and surely there would be an airbender there who could teach him. Technically, he knew he should learn earthbending first, but from what Jiang Cheng had said, it sounded like the bulk of the war was being fought in the Earth Kingdom. It would be better to learn airbending before he tackled that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So, you wanna go penguin sledding?” he asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jiang Yanli laughed. “Sure.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re too old for penguin sledding,” Jiang Cheng snapped. “We have training to do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Uh.” Wei Wuxian looked around at the handful of children, mothers, and the elderly. “Who are you training exactly?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jiang Yanli hastily said, “Wei-gongzi, I’ll show you around. If you help me with my chores, then we can go penguin sledding.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure,” he said, and followed her into the largest igloo, which seemed to be a large kitchen, not a home. It was warm inside, so he shrugged off his coat to help with the food preparation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Please don’t mind A-Cheng,” Jiang Yanli said softly. “It was so hard for him when the warriors left, especially our mother.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wei Wuxian nodded. “I didn’t really know my parents,” he said. “They both died when I was really young, in a storm. Jiang Songlin’s father took me in – he was like a dad to me, and Jiang Songlin was like my brother.” He laughed suddenly and said, “In a way, you and Jiang Cheng are my great-grand-niece and nephew!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, goodness,” Jiang Yanli said, laughing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So your mother is a warrior – she’s not a bender?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, our father was a waterbender, one of the greatest,” Jiang Yanli said. “He died when A-Cheng was eight and I was fourteen, in one of the fire nation’s attacks. Our mother left A-Cheng in charge of the village, and he’s been harder on himself than anyone else could be. He thinks of it as his duty to take care of everyone here, and he’s been trying to learn waterbending on his own. Give him a little time and I’m sure he’ll let you teach him.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah.” Wei Wuxian shook his head slightly. He couldn’t stay here, that much was obvious. Jiang Cheng would have to keep learning on his own.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But he could go penguin sledding first. Better for them to think he was just a silly water tribe boy than to realize who he really was. And he hadn’t been penguin sledding in, apparently, a hundred years.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was just as much as he had remembered it. Sliding into the shadow of the remains of a Fire Nation vessel, well, that was new. “How long has this been here?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Probably almost a hundred years,” Jiang Yanli said. “It was from one of the first attacks. Ah – are you going in?” she asked, her tone anxious.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just want to look around,” he said. “See if it’s the same as I remember.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you fight in the war, back then?” Jiang Yanli asked, as they walked the corridors of the ship. It <em>was</em> like he remembered, although some of it had rusted over the years. Snow and ice had filled some of the rooms, and the wildlife had carried in sticks or stones to make nests.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A little,” he said. “Like your mom, I went to the Earth Kingdom. So I wasn’t here when the South Pole was attacked. When I came back . . .”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He didn’t really want to talk about it, but would have preferred <em>not</em> to have been saved by a booby trap that set off a flare. “Shit shit shit!” he muttered, grabbing Jiang Yanli and making a run for it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I knew it!” Jiang Cheng shouted, as soon as they got back to the village. “You signaled the fire navy with that flare! You’re leading them right to us!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wei Wuxian winced, and Jiang Yanli protested, “It was an accident! We went onto the fire navy ship and set off a booby trap.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A-Li, that ship is dangerous!” Gran-gran protested.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It was my fault,” Wei Wuxian said. “I wanted to look around. Don’t blame Jiang-guniang, please.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then get out of here!” Jiang Cheng shouted. “You’re just causing problems. We don’t want you in our village!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A-Cheng, no!” Jiang Yanli protested. “This is a mistake. He can teach you waterbending!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t need the help of some stranger!” Jiang Cheng snapped. “I’m keeping my promise to Mom. I’m protecting this village from threats!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wei-gongzi is not a threat!” Jiang Yanli said. “He’s not our enemy. He was a member of our tribe back before he was frozen. This is his home!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wei Wuxian winced. “No, it isn’t,” he said quietly, and Jiang Yanli gave him a protesting look. “It hasn’t been for a long time. I think – your brother’s right, Jiang-guniang. I’m only going to cause problems for you if I’m here, so it’s probably better if I go. I’m sure Jiang-gongzi can learn waterbending on his own, given enough time.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But Wei-gongzi,” Jiang Yanli said, “it’s not fair to you for them to expel you from the village for an accident.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wei Wuxian shook his head. “I can’t stay anyway, so it might as well be for this.” He managed a smile for her. “This is goodbye, Jiang-guniang. Thanks for penguin sledding with me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where will you go?” Jiang Yanli asked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll figure it out,” he said. He bowed to her, then turned and bowed to the other villagers. “It was nice meeting everybody,” he said, and the words sounded so hollow and lame to him. But he knew he had to leave, and he forced himself not to look back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>~ ~ ~ ~</span>
</p><p>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jiang Cheng paced back and forth along the walls of the village, waiting to see whether or not the fire nation was going to head straight to them. Although he was angry about the flare, he had known it was inevitable that one day they would be attacked. It had happened over and over again over the years. He had prepared for this, but there was a part of him that still couldn’t believe it was happening.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the snow turned the dark gray, mixed with the ash from the fire nation ships, he knew it was time. And when the ship loomed up over the walls, the water in his legs turned to ice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Despite what his sister seemed to think, he was competent in a fight. He couldn’t do a lot of waterbending, but he had trained with his mother. She had never thought much of benders, saying it was like cheating. Her marriage to Jiang Fengmian had been contentious, and they had often argued about whether or not Jiang Cheng should be trained as a waterbender or as a traditional fighter. That had ended when Jiang Fengmian had died, and he was left without a teacher.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>So when the troops began to descend from the ship, he fought, and he even claimed victory over the first several to emerge. But at the end of the day he was just one man, and they numbered over a dozen. He was pressed down into the snow on his knees.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where are you hiding him?” the man in the fanciest helmet demanded. He looked about Jiang Yanli’s age, maybe a little older, and clearly felt he was very important. He grabbed Gran-Gran by the collar and said, “He’d be about this age, master of all four elements.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Master of what now?</span>
  </em>
  <span> Jiang Cheng wondered, as the man shot fire at them. What was this asshole talking about? Hiding who? Some old man? “We’re not hiding anybody!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t lie to me!” the man shouted. “Don’t you know who I am?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why should we know who you are?” Jiang Cheng retorted, trying to get to his feet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m a prince! The son of the fire lord himself, Wen Chao!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jiang Cheng swallowed hard. “Fine, but we still don’t know who you’re talking about and we’re not hiding anybody in our village!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lies!” Wen Chao shot another wave of fire at them, only to be knocked off his feet as Wei Wuxian came zipping into the village on the back of a penguin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry I’m late,” Wei Wuxian said.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jiang Cheng sighed and mumbled, “Thanks for coming back.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wen Chao struggled back to his feet with an indignant shout, and Wei Wuxian said, “Looking for me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re the waterbender?” Wen Chao said, sounding disbelieving. Jiang Cheng tensed. He knew from his mother that when the Fire Nation had killed Jiang Fengmian, they believed that they had killed the last waterbender in the southern tribe. His own status as a waterbender was carefully guarded, and was the reason she had refused to take him with her when she went to fight. Here, he could stay safe while he mastered waterbending.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But those thoughts were brief, because it was clear that Wen Chao wasn’t talking about him. Wen Chao was talking about the <em>real</em> waterbender, the one who had appeared from nowhere, frozen in an iceberg.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then Wen Chao said, “You’re the avatar?” and threw Jiang Cheng’s world into disarray.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Several of the villagers gasped, and Jiang Cheng’s gaze darted to his sister, only to see that she didn’t really look surprised. And of course she wouldn’t. Why would she? It was painfully obvious in hindsight. The avatar had vanished a hundred years ago, and Wei Wuxian had been in the ice a hundred years. They knew the avatar had been a member of the southern water tribe. Why hadn’t he seen it earlier?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wen Chao sent out a fire blast, and Wei Wuxian deflected it with a wall of water. Jiang Cheng couldn’t help but stare as Wei Wuxian fought. He was <em>amazing</em>. He could do things with water that Jiang Cheng had never even dreamed off. In his hands, water was a potent weapon, one that tossed back all the soldiers, turned to ice daggers, swirled around him like a shield, whipped around the Fire Nation men like a tornado.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But then one of the blasts he deflected nearly missed a group of the children, and they screamed. Wei Wuxian’s eyes went wide, and he put his hands up. “If I go with you, will you promise to leave them alone?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wen Chao’s eyes narrowed, but he nodded. A few moments later, Wei Wuxian was surrounded by Fire Nation soldiers. Jiang Cheng was unceremoniously heaved over to the rest of the villagers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wei-gongzi, please, don’t do this!” Jiang Yanli protested tearfully.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t worry, Jiang-guniang,” Wei Wuxian said, with a reassuring smile as they bound his hands behind his back. “I’ll be fine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He was manhandled up the ship’s ramp. It closed behind him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jiang Yanli burst into tears. They stood in silence as the ship sailed away. A few minutes later, all they could see was the smoke on the horizon.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We have to go after that ship, A-Cheng!” Jiang Yanli protested. “Wei-gongzi saved our village, now we have to save him!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jiang Cheng sighed. Their mother was going to kill him for this. “A-jie, I – ”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s on our side, A-Cheng! If we don’t help him, who will? And he’s the avatar! For the first time in a hundred years – ”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A-jie!” Jiang Cheng interrupted. “Are you going to keep arguing with me or are you going to help me pack the canoe?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jiang Yanli turned, her mouth a perfect ‘o’ of surprise that then broke into a wide smile. “I’ll go get us provisions,” she said, and ran towards the kitchen. Five minutes later, the canoe was packed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t forget these,” Gran-gran said, pressing two bundled sleeping bags into their hands as they headed for the canoe. She saw their surprise and smiled. “It’s been so long since I’ve had any hope, but you brought it back to life. Wei-gongzi is the avatar. He’s the world’s only chance. You both found him for a reason, and your destinies are entwined with these. A-Cheng, let him help you become a waterbending master. Find your mother and help her fight this war. I know we can win it as long as the avatar is on our side.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know we can, too,” Jiang Yanli said, and embraced their grandmother. Then she looked at the canoe. “But however will we catch up?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well . . .” Jiang Cheng took a deep breath. “Get in, a-jie. Let’s see if I can duplicate what Wei Wuxian did yesterday.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jiang Yanli nodded, and he helped her down into the canoe. How had Wei Wuxian done this? Jiang Cheng had watched him closely, wanting to learn even if he wouldn’t admit it. It had been kind of a side-to-side motion at first –</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh!” Jiang Yanli gasped, clutching at the side of the boat as it lurched into motion. The water rocked them back and forth as it swelled underneath them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sorry, hang on,” Jiang Cheng muttered. “Maybe it was more like this – side to side but pulling towards myself as the same time – ”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The wave surged, sending the boat sweeping forward. “You’re doing it!” Jiang Yanli cheered. “A-Cheng, you’re doing it!” She waved to the village as it dwindled behind them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Be nice to your sister, A-Cheng!” Gran-gran shouted, her voice already fading.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Jiang Cheng focused on urging the little canoe forward. “What are we going to do when we get there?” he asked. “Or had you not thought about that part yet?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll figure something out,” Jiang Yanli said, with confidence in her voice. “Don’t worry.”</span>
</p><p>
