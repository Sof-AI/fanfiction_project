          <div class="userstuff"><p>“Why can’t <em>I </em>go with <em>Shijie</em>,” Wei-<em>shixiong</em> fusses yet again, and Meng Yao ducks his head trying not to attract his attention. It wasn’t like Meng Yao had been the one to decide which two Jiang disciples would get the honor of joining Jiang Yanli at Koi Tower. It was Meishan Yu’s tradition, but Madam Yu had insisted on it, two Jiang disciples devoted only to their Shijie and her comforts must be sent with her, as a bridal gift from her parents. Meng Yao had obviously volunteered himself for the duty, and so had more than half of the diciples! Jiang Yanli is the best Shijie ever, she’s soft and kind and her cultivation is kind of weak, which only serves to make all of them protective of her.</p>
<p>But only Liu Xia and Meng Yao had been chosen in the end, possibly because they’re both pretty and well-mannered, and won’t cause too much of a ruckus at Koi Tower.</p>
<p>“Because you’re supposed to stay with <em>me</em>,” Wanyin-<em>shixiong</em> says, slapping him upside the head. “And stop whining, you’re upsetting Yao-<em>shidi</em>.”</p>
<p>“Wha – Oh! <em>Shidi, </em>I didn’t see you!” Meng Yao gives him a weak smile, which just makes Wei Wuxian bound over. “It’s fine, I know you’ll take care of her,” says Wei Wuxian.</p>
<p>“I will,” Meng Yao promises. “I’ll make sure she’s happy.” He will, too. Part of the reason he’d volunteered was selfish. While his dreams of being recognized as Jin Guangshan’ son had been crushed years ago, he can’t stomp out the childish desire to live up on that gilded tower any more than he can crush the tender, inappropriate feelings he’s had for his engaged Shijie for years, now.</p>
<p>“That’s good,” says Wei Wuxian, clapping a hand on his shoulder. “Jiang Cheng and I will miss you, Yao-<em>shidi.</em>” He looks so earnest as he says it, then glances at Jiang Wanyin meaningfully.</p>
<p>“Don’t look at me like that, Meng Yao’s not stupid, he knows to write to us if he needs something. We’ll take care of it,” Jiang Wanyin snaps. “Right?”</p>
<p>“I do, <em>shixiong</em>,” Meng Yao agrees. His eyes burn, as if <em>he’s</em> the one being married out of his sect, like a bride on her wedding day. He inhales carefully, and fixes his smile to be brighter, even though his nose is sour with the awkward feelings. “I should be going now,” he says. “Shijie should be ready.”</p>
<p>“See you at the feast,” Wei Wuxian says, and Meng Yao nods, and hurries away.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p><em>If Jin Guangshan had taken me in, maybe you’d be mine, </em>he thinks, as he follows two measured steps behind Jiang Yanli in her resplendent crimson robes, edged with gold.</p>
<p>It’s ridiculous, of course. Jiang Yanli was engaged to Jin Zixuan because their mothers were sworn sisters. Even if Meng Yao had been Jin Guangshan’s firstborn and heir, Madam Yu would not have thought Meng Yao worthy of her daughter. She barely thinks Jin Zixuan is worthy, even though she’s a little fond of him, which Meng Yao has found amusing on occasion. She always intervenes when Wei Wuxian runs his mouth off about Jin Zixuan, but always just a <em>little </em>slow, so that Wei Wuxian can get at least half his insults out.</p>
<p>It keeps Jin Zixuan on his toes, and Madam Yu amused. Meng Yao doesn’t think anyone else aside from Sect Leader Jiang has noticed. <em>If only Shijie did not love someone so unworthy, </em>Meng Yao thinks, desperately. Jin Zixuan was spoilt and selfish and did not care for her, but she loved him steadfastly. Sometimes, Meng Yao regrets jumping between Wei-<em>shixiong </em>and Jin-<em>gongzi </em>on the several occasions when they nearly came to blows at the Cloud Recesses. Perhaps a proper fight might have been an easy way to end the engagement, and Shijie would have been heartbroken, but <em>free.</em></p>
<p>Meng Yao watches Jiang Yanli take her bows, beautiful and poised, beside Jin Zixuan. Even with his fine features and elegant looks accented by the expensive robes, his blank expression makes his appearance pale beside her. The hope and love that is suffused across <em>Shijie</em>’s face makes her the most beautiful she’s ever been.</p>
<p>Meng Yao, because he is a fool, only falls more in love.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Jin Zixuan is perhaps, not the <em>worst </em>of husbands. Meng Yao doesn’t know if it was due to Madam Jin’s careful instruction for her son to <em>not </em>emulate his father, but he is attentive to Jiang Yanli’s comforts. Meng Yao circumspectly checks with Liu Xia that Jin Zixuan is not hurting their <em>Shijie </em>behind closed doors and is assured that she is fine.</p>
<p>Meng Yao is afraid that it’s not enough. Taking tea and dinners with her, asking her out to watch the Jin disciples train under his command, bringing her jewelry, and spending some nights in her bed… Jin Zixuan does all of these with careful intensity and yet it’s not all that Jiang Yanli had hoped for, in a marriage. And Jin Zixuan, shy, awkward, spoilt Jin Zixuan, has no idea what else to do with a wife.</p>
<p>It would perhaps have been a little endearing, watching him struggle, if <em>Shijie </em>was not the one whose smile turned plastic and brittle every time Jin Zixuan messed up.</p>
<p>Losing his patience, Meng Yao interferes when Jin Zixuan is stuffing his foot further and further into his mouth over the course of one meal. Jin Zixuan was trying to tell Jiang Yanli about a fancy place in Jinling that makes excellent food, far better than anything that the chefs at Koi Tower provide, not knowing that Jiang Yanli had spent all her afternoon preparing this meal for them to share with each other. Shijie had grown quieter and quieter through the meal, only prompting more desperate – and frankly ludicrous – boasting.</p>
<p>“That restaurant is not far,” Meng Yao says, stepping forward. “Forgive this Meng Yao for his impertinence, but should I take this meal away, and have the young master and mistress a new dinner from there?” he asks. “Dinner would not be delayed long.” Jiang Yanli keeps her head down, but Jin Zixuan looks up in confusion. Before he can open his mouth to agree and ruin <em>everything, </em>Meng Yao shakes his head firmly and looks pointedly at Jiang Yanli.</p>
<p>Gods be good, somehow, that got through to him. His eyes widen, and he looks at Jiang Yanli half panicked. “If husband would rather eat a better meal, I do not mind a delay,” Jiang Yanli says softly. There’s a tinge of hurt there that even Jin Zixuan cannot ignore, and Meng Yao hates himself for being a part of this.</p>
<p>“No, I. I. I’ve enjoyed the meal very much, today. But Yanli has eaten less than usual, and not complimented the cooking even once. Is it not to her preference?”</p>
<p>“Not at all, I think it is fine.” But there’s some suspicion in her voice when she asks, “So Husband likes the food, tonight?”</p>
<p>Jin Zixuan hastens to assure her that he does, and goes one step further, “We had a pork and lentil soup, last week, that reminds me of this. I enjoyed that greatly as well.” He <em>had, </em>the pig had had three bowls of it, leaving Meng Yao and Liu Xia to split one bowl of Shijie’s cooking afterwards between them. But that he’d identified that as Jiang Yanli’s cooking was impressive. Meng Yao doesn’t know why he stutters out the compliments so poorly, but he does make up for it with ridiculously sincere eyes blinking at <em>Shijie.</em></p>
<p>“I’ll try to cook more often, then, if Husband enjoys it,” Jiang Yanli says, and Jin Zixuan does a poor job of pretending to be surprised, though his compliments to her skills do sound sincere. It’s just the shade of comic and sweet (and if Meng Yao wasn’t too cross about it to admit it: <em>endearing) </em>that has <em>Shijie </em>smiling her brightest happiest smile.</p>
<p>Jin Zixuan looks floored, spending the rest of the meal in a bit of a daze. Meng Yao watches, and tries to squash down the jealousy. Jiang Yanli loves Jin Zixuan, and all that Meng Yao can do for her is to make sure she wants for nothing, even the love of her foolish husband.</p>
<p>He can do this, he tells himself, even as his chest squeezes. After Jin Zixuan finally leaves, Meng Yao put on his best smile for Jiang Yanli. “So that went well!” he says. HE doesn’t even have to fake it, Jiang Yanli is still smiling widely from happiness, cheeks flushed, eyes bright. Meng Yao regrets nothing.</p>
<p>“Thank you, A-Yao,” she says, stepping closer. “You’re the best <em>shidi</em>,” she says, and leans forward and presses a kiss to his cheek.</p>
<p>
  <em>!!!!</em>
</p>
<p>“I’m going to tell Wei-<em>shixiong </em>that Shijie said that,” Meng Yao says, reflexively. It takes all his self-control not to touch his cheek where the faint pressure of her lips had been. His heart is beating too fast, and he’s terrified that he might be blushing.</p>
<p>She laughs, indulgent, and smiles at him again, a tinge wistful. “I’ll tell him too. A-Xian is A-Xian. He’s my little brother, but Meng Yao is the best shidi.”</p>
<p>He knows that it’s not what she means, it <em>can’t </em>mean what he wishes it was, but Meng Yao still hears, <em>Meng Yao is not my brother. </em></p>
<p>Does that mean if he had asked her out before the wedding, she might have said yes?</p>
<p>Not that it matters, it’s far too late. Jiang Yanli smiles at him again before dismissing him and Liu Xia for the night. Liu-<em>shijie </em>gives him a pointed look, and Meng Yao blanks his face out. “Don’t say anything, please.”</p>
<p>He doesn’t think he could take it.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Of all the possible consequences from his interference, Jiang Yanli’s happiness, Meng Yao’s own heartbreak – “Just how many times can <em>shidi </em>be heartbroken?” asks Liu Xia half-exasperated, half-sympathetic, and Meng Yao pettily refuses to talk to her – the one he hadn’t anticipated was Jin Zixuan seeking him out the next day, and dragging him off to his private office.</p>
<p>“Young Master Jin has need of this one?” Meng Yao asks nervously.</p>
<p>“I wanted to thank you!” says Jin Zixuan.</p>
<p>“Please, this Meng Yao hardly deserves that, I was only looking out for Shijie’s welfare. She cared a lot and would have been very upset if Young Master Jin seemed to dislike it. This one was only doing his duty,” Meng Yao says.</p>
<p>“Your duty,” Jin Zixuan repeats, staring curiously, before smiling. “Excellent! It just so happens that I need your help, and that our goals are similarly aligned.” says Jin Zixuan. “I need you to help me woo A-Li. All of Mother’s and Jin Zixun’s ideas have gone over poorly, and I don’t want to keep making a fool of myself.”</p>
<p><em>Well as long as he’s aware that he’s a fool, </em>Meng Yao thinks smugly, before the whole sentence sinks in. “Young Master Jin, Yanli-<em>shijie</em> is your wife? You don’t have to…?” Never mind that jZX absolutely should worship the ground Jiang Yanli walks on for giving him the time of day, he can't be going around attempting to woo someone he married! People would talk! And Jiang Yanli was – as much as it pained Meng Yao to admit it – very thoroughly wooed by Jin Zixuan already.</p>
<p>Jin Zixuan frowns. “But I want her to be happy here, and you know how I should do it. You must share.” Meng Yao considers, wondering if this would count as conspiring against Jiang Yanli, or merely an extension of his loyalties to her. “Please?” asks Jin Zixuan, with the tone of one terribly unused to the word. “I’m willing to compensate you for your trouble.”</p>
<p>It turns Meng Yao’s stomach. As if he could be bribed.</p>
<p>
  <strike>As if his services came with a simple price.</strike>
</p>
<p>“I’ve offended you, haven’t I?” asks Jin Zixuan quietly, after a long few moments of silence.</p>
<p>“No of course not, this one just could not possibly accept compensation for helping his mistress,” Meng Yao says, snapping out of it, but Jin Zixuan shakes his head.</p>
<p>“I apologize. I don’t… I don’t even get how I just offended you! This is why I need your help, you’re <em>good </em>at these things. You always bring the right tea and remember who people are and what they like, and <em>everyone likes you.</em>”</p>
<p>Meng Yao stands shocked. He had no idea that Jin Zixuan had noticed anything about him.</p>
<p>Jin Zixuan stares back at him looking just as shocked, eyes wide at his own outburst. “Never mind, please excuse me, I should not have disturbed you–” he says, and backs away as if he’s about to leave (and <em>why</em>, this is Jin Zixuan’s office, he should dismiss Meng Yao if he’s done with him), and Meng Yao stops him.</p>
<p>“Young Master Jin! I’ve known <em>shijie </em>a long time, I could let you know what sorts of things she enjoys?”</p>
<p>Jin Zixuan smiles faintly, and nods, “Thank you,” and really does flee from the room, leaving Meng Yao alone in his personal office. There could be classified, sensitive information in here! Jin Zixuan is an idiot.</p>
<p>And Meng Yao is also an idiot, because he thinks he can finally see what <em>Shijie </em>sees in this peacock.</p>
<p>He’s kind of cute.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>What follows is, perhaps, the most trying experience of Meng Yao’s life. He must have been a heartless murderer in another life for fate to saddle him with such misfortune.</p>
<p>Meng Yao finds himself in the position of unofficial relationship manager, making suggestions on both sides for romantic overtures, and taking care of the simple logistics and arrangements associated with them. The simplest involving bribing a merchant from the marketplace to set aside the freshest produce aside for Jiang Yanli, and the messiest by far assisting Jin Zixuan dig a lotus pond at Jinlintai for his wife.</p>
<p>(And they’re happy, they’re <em>both </em>happy, and Meng Yao is left floundering wondering what his place is, how many years is he to exist between them, making sure they have fun? And on the worst nights, he wonders, <em>what will I do when they’ve learned each other well enough to not need me at all?</em>)</p>
<p>“I’ve cleared my schedule for the day!” Jin Zixuan reports to Meng Yao early one morning, like an eager little puppy.</p>
<p>“Ah… does Young Master Jin need me to make plans for an outing?”</p>
<p>“No, I’ve made the plans already,” says Jin Zixuan.</p>
<p>When no further information is forthcoming, Meng Yao has to nudge, “So Young Master Jin needs this one to…?”</p>
<p>“You’ll be accompanying us. Get dressed for travelling, and meet us outside, Yanli is getting ready right now.”</p>
<p>“Of course, I’ll let Liu-shijie know, we’ll be there in–”</p>
<p>“Not her, just you,” Jin Zixuan says firmly, then leaves, leaving Meng Yao staring blankly at his retreating back.</p>
<p>When they meet outside, Meng Yao in more sturdy robes, sleeves bound for comfort while flying, Jiang Yanli is already there, and she smiles at him warmly. Jin Zixuan helps Jiang Yanli onto his own sword, and gestures to Meng Yao to mount his own, and they’re off.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Their surprise destination is a lake. Meng Yao swallows back his amusement that Jin Zixuan wanted to take two people who grew up in Yunmeng to water, but Jiang Yanli looks pleased. He’s a little more impressed when Jin Zixuan leads them to a small personal dock, with two boats, and tells them they can go out on the water.</p>
<p>He looks so <em>proud </em>of himself, it’s adorable. Meng Yao offers to take the second boat to give them some privack but neither one of them agrees, insisting that he join them. Which is how they end up on a clear, beautiful lake, nestled between lovely mountains and greenery, Meng Yao having to adjust his rowing to keep Jin Zixuan from sending them in circles.</p>
<p>They stop after a while, just drifting on the calm surface, and Jiang Yanli is telling them about her day, everything is going <em>fine. </em>Jiang Yanli and Jin Zixuan are in a great mood and it’s infectious, he can’t help but smile at them both, somehow it doesn’t ache so sharply today, that he can never have either one. They’re happy, and they care for him, and that’s enough.</p>
<p>“Meng Yao?” says <em>Shijie</em>, startling Meng Yao out of his thoughts. He’d stopped paying attention.</p>
<p>“Yes, <em>Shijie?</em>” he asks, she’s looking at him very carefully.</p>
<p>And then she leans forward and presses her lips to his.</p>
<p>And Meng Yao.</p>
<p>Meng Yao kind of.</p>
<p>Okay, he stops working for a bit, because everything is just Soft. Lips. On. His. Her breath against his cheek and upper lip, and.</p>
<p>Jiang Yanli is kissing him.</p>
<p>Jiang Yanli, his first love, unreachable, because she married – he steps away from her in shock (too late, too late, they’d kissed for several heartbeats, but his brain was too fogged up to remember <em>her husband just two feet away</em>), says, “Shijie, <em>what</em>–” and then gets tackled out of the boat by Jin Zixuan.</p>
<p>He lands in the water, terrified, struggling to get away.</p>
<p>“Wait! I’m sorry!”</p>
<p>“A-Yao, it’s okay!”</p>
<p>The yells do not make sense, especially when Meng Yao is trying his best to swim away from them in his heavy, sodden robes (Jin robes are <em>not </em>made for a casual toss off the pier and into the water, like Jiang robes are).</p>
<p>“Please stop!” Jin Zixuan yells again, a bit garbled from his poor attempt to swim after him.</p>
<p><em>He’s going to drown, </em>thinks Meng Yao dispassionately.</p>
<p>Jiang Yanli wouldn’t let her husband drown. Meng Yao should leave…</p>
<p>But Jin Zixuan is so tall, and wearing his fancy robes and there’s no way Shijie could pull him back onto the boat, she’d have to tow him to shore, and then swim back for the boat.</p>
<p>Feeling a little suicidal and a little defiant, he swims back to Jin Zixuan, who clutches at him, babbling still, and helps him to the boat. It’s only as Jin Zixuan ignores Jiang Yanli’s outstretched hand in favor of clutching Meng Yao by the robes, that he realizes that Jin Zixuan is <em>apologizing. </em></p>
<p>“I thought you were going to fall, you pulled away from A-Li so quickly,” Jin Zixuan says again, once they’ve both clambered back onto the boat.</p>
<p>“So you pushed me in?” asks Meng Yao. He’s biting his lip to keep from smiling, and Jiang Yanli is covering her mouth so as not to make a noise, but her shoulders are shaking. Meng Yao has never seen anyone look <em>so mortified</em>, before, Jin Zixuan is flushed alarmingly red.</p>
<p>“It was an accident,” Jin Zixuan mumbles.</p>
<p>“Young Master Jin should make it up to me,” Meng Yao decides.</p>
<p>“I will!” says Jin Zixuan, and Meng Yao casts his eyes towards Jiang Yanli, who nods encouragingly. <em>Knowingly. </em></p>
<p>Meng Yao swallows, gathers his courage, and says, “Kiss me.” It doesn’t sound quite as strong as he meant it to, sounds just a bit nervous. Questioning.</p>
<p>But Jin Zixuan just blinks at him with those pretty eyes and then leans closer, pressing his soaked lips to Meng Yao’s, and he kisses back, and almost <em>can’t </em>because he wants to grin too widely.</p>
<p>“Really?” he asks them both, after they’ve all traded more kisses, until Meng Yao imagines they all taste the same now – like Shijie and lake water, if he’s honest – and have settled at a picturesque riverbank to eat together. “You both want..?” He can’t finish the sentence. He doesn’t know what they think they’re leading up to.</p>
<p>“We want Yao-shidi,” says Jiang Yanli, simply. “As much as him as he’d like to share with us.”</p>
<p>“And share baby-duties,” Jin Zixuan adds. “It’ll be easier with three.”</p>
<p>“A-Xuan,” says Jiang Yanli, fondly exasperated, before Meng Yao can make words again. He can feel his lips move but can’t breathe. A <em>baby. </em></p>
<p><em>“Shijie!” </em>he cries, when he finally can. “You’re having a <em>baby</em>?”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>“Da-shixiong and Er-shixiong are going to break your legs,” Meng Yao warns.</p>
<p>“I’m her <em>husband</em>,” defends Jin Zixuan, faux-pouting.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Jin Zixuan likes kissing, and not even the passionate longing kind that Meng Yao has read about in romance novels, but he likes ducking down and pressing his lips to Meng Yao’s dimple, which <em>invariably </em>makes Meng Yao smile wider, even if he wants to pretend to be strict, and then he just gets caught and kissed again until he’s laughing too hard and has to push Jin Zixuan away because he can’t breathe.</p>
<p>The peacock looks stunningly self-satisfied after that, so Meng Yao just has to pull him in for a proper kiss, and then Jiang Yanli whistles at them, low and appreciative and Jin Zixuan blushes crimson and Meng Yao has to hide in his chest, because <em>shijie. </em>Clearly Wei Wuxian had learned more from her than Meng Yao had realized.</p>
<p>Meng Yao’s not sure what he’s doing, inserting himself into his shijie’s marriage, (his brother’s marriage, by blood if not in name), but it’s kind of nice. He doesn’t think that they’re playing with him, they really want him there, and Meng Yao knows that he fills them out, in ways they don’t quite fill each other. Love is a pretty thing, but <em>someone </em>needs to be practical (and that’s not Jin Zixuan) and someone needs to be vicious when necessary (and that’s not Jiang Yanli).</p>
<p>He should have known that it wouldn’t last. Three days after the first time Jin Zixuan had pressed him down into his and shijie’s bed (Meng Yao had lost his virginity with his head in Jiang Yanli’s lap, her hands tracing teasingly over his lips, through his hair…) Madam Jin calls him to her rooms for a private meeting. It’s a testament to how foolish Meng Yao has become, that he doesn’t even suspect anything, and makes his way to her rooms.</p>
<p>It’s only when he sees her, face white with fury that hardens her red rimmed eyes, lips pressed thin, that he falls to his knees and bows low, wondering, terrified, how they had been found out so soon.</p>
<p>Madam Jin throws a small pouch in front of him. He doesn’t dare to look up.</p>
<p>“Oh, stop playing at respect. You <em>whore. </em>I told Yu Ziyuan not to let you into her house hold, and you’ve proved me right. Take the pouch, it has one hundred taels. Take it and be gone. If you ever return to the Jin or the Jiang, I will see you dead.”</p>
<p>“Madam Jin, I didn’t – ”</p>
<p>“Didn’t what? Is there anything you haven’t done, you filthy son of a whore, you disgusting piece of shit. To try to ruin your own brother’s marriage in the sickest of ways.”</p>
<p>“Please,” he whispers. “I wasn’t trying to ruin – ” he’s cut off by a teacup shattering in front of him, flinches away from flying porcelain and splashing tea. In his inattention, he misses the teapot, that shatters against his head, knocking him backwards, gasping for breath as his vision blacks out from the pain.</p>
<p>“Mother!” Familiar arms wrap around Meng Yao protectively.</p>
<p>“Don’t touch him!” she shrieks. “That filthy bastard is your father’s and a <em>whore’s. </em>Jin Zixuan, have you taken leave of your senses?”</p>
<p>“Mother, don’t–” there’s the shattering clash of something else, this time it does not hit him, though Jin Zixuan twists around him protectively, jostling his head. The ringing in his ears rises, until it drowns out Madam Jin’s rage, and everything blacks out.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Meng Yao wakes up with a small hand in his. He holds on, but doesn’t look up at Shijie. He can’t, now when she knows.</p>
<p>“Don’t cry, A-Yao,” she says in her soft voice. He hadn’t realized he was. He closes his eyes and breathes, waiting for the rest of it. He dozes off, with Jiang Yanli still holding his hand.</p>
<p>When he wakes again, Jin Zixuan is with him.</p>
<p>“Did you know?” he asks. His voice is so soft. Kind.</p>
<p>And Meng Yao could lie. Could say he had no idea.</p>
<p>“I did,” he whispers.</p>
<p>“Okay,” says Jin Zixuan. He reaches out to pat Meng Yao’s hand, gently. Meng Yao has no idea what he’s thinking.</p>
<p>“Why?” he asks.</p>
<p>“If you knew before you agreed to… you know… does that mean you don’t mind?”</p>
<p>Meng Yao feels warm tears against his cheeks again. “I’ve never been Sect Leader Jin’s son, he threw my mother away like <em>trash</em>. I didn’t <em>want</em> to be your brother.”</p>
<p>There’s a long silence, broken only by Meng Yao’s sleep-heavy breathing, and then Jin Zixuan presses a kiss to his forehead, and Meng Yao opens his eyes, looking up at Jin Zixuan in shock. “What?”</p>
<p>“If Meng Yao does not wish to be my brother, he does not have to be. Would he do me the honor of becoming my husband?”</p>
<p>Impossible, Sect Leader Jin <em>despises </em>cutsleeves, there’s no way he’d let Jin Zixuan marry a man, to marry one of Jin Guangshan’ own bastards. To say nothing of Madam Jin.</p>
<p>“You know I can’t,” says Meng Yao.</p>
<p>“But does he <em>want to</em>?” asks Jin Zixuan, leaning close, tucking a strand of Meng Yao’s hair behind his ear.</p>
<p>There’s a creeping terror associated with telling certain truths. Meng Yao had long ago learned to lie instead, that it’s far safer in the long run than to expose one’s vulnerabilities with honesty. This time, the lie dies on his tongue.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to answer now,” Jin Zixuan says quietly. “You can take your time.”</p>
<p>“Where’s <em>Shijie</em>?” asks Meng Yao instead.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Meng Yao gets transferred back to Lotus Pier, a <em>shidi </em>sent to take his place as Jiang Yanli’s servant. He does not know how, but the reasons for the change are hushed up incredibly well.</p>
<p>Wei-<em>shixiong</em> and Jiang-<em>shixiong </em>are strangely nice to him, after his return. Meng Yao has no idea what they think happened. Madam Yu, long considered to have a soft-spot for Meng Yao by his disciple siblings treats him no differently than before, which is an immense relief.</p>
<p>Meng Yao settles back into his old life weirdly, like a plant too big for its pot. His roots scramble for purchase, but he feels adrift.</p>
<p>The only one treating Meng Yao differently – and not even badly, just different – is Sect Leader Jiang. He refuses to return Meng Yao’s duties to him, insisting that since they’d been reassigned, there was no reason to cause an upheaval quite yet. He’d said, ‘<em>when they will only have to be reorganized again when you leave,’ </em>and Meng Yao worries that phrase over and over in his mind on sleepless nights, before falling into a fitful sleep, only to be plagued by dreams of Jiang Yanli and Jin Zixuan.</p>
<p>He doesn’t know which are the nightmares, the ones where they tell him they hate him, or the ones where they love him.</p>
<p>Sect Leader Jiang calls Meng Yao into his office, three months after his hushed-up return.</p>
<p>To Meng Yao’s surprise, Jin Zixuan is there as well, looking serious.</p>
<p>“Is something wrong with Shijie?” he asks, worried.</p>
<p>“A-Li is well,” says Jin Zixuan. “She asked me to pass you this letter.”</p>
<p>Meng Yao takes the folded up paper, and looks between his Sect Leader and unacknowledged half-brother. When neither one says anything, he looks down at the letter. <em>‘Say yes, silly,’</em> it says, in <em>Shijie’s</em> elegant script.</p>
<p>“Jin Zixuan,” says Meng Yao slowly. “Why are you here.”</p>
<p>“There’s a clause in my marriage to Yanli, that I wished to amend,” he says. Meng Yao knows the one, the one forbidding a second marriage or accepting concubines. That too was a Yu sect tradition that had been carried on through Jiang Yanli.</p>
<p>“Are you sure?” he asks.</p>
<p>“I’m sure,” says Jin Zixuan.</p>
<p>Meng Yao glances at Jiang Fengmian, who nods encouragingly. “It is possible to make a good thing better, A-Yao. I give you my blessing.” Meng Yao doesn’t know if he’s imagining the wistfulness in JFM’s tone.</p>
<p>Meng Yao glances back up at Jin Zixuan, who hasn’t looked away a moment, and there’s clear hope visible on his face.</p>
<p>It’s foolish, there’s no way that this won’t come back to bite them.</p>
<p>Meng Yao <em>hates </em>fools.</p>
<p>“Ask me again,” he says softly, and Jin Zixuan smiles radiantly.</p>
<p><em>I didn’t even say yes, yet, </em>thinks Meng Yao fondly.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>This second wedding ceremony is much simpler. Meng Yao is not the <em>di-</em>wife, and he’s an orphan, so it’s obviously not even a fraction as important as Yanli’s wedding.</p>
<p>Wei Wuxian still fusses on the wedding-day though, muttering darkly about the peacock stealing their favorite <em>shidi</em> away too. Jiang Wanyin slaps him upside the head and tells him not to bother Meng Yao, while he helps with Meng Yao’s hair and veil. They promise him that they’ve threatened Jin Zixuan on his behalf, and he thanks them, doing his best not to laugh.</p>
<p>If he fails a little, well, it’s his wedding-day. His <em>shixiong</em> are generous enough to let it slide.</p>
<p>Jin Guangshan refuses to attend at all, and Meng Yao only feels vague relief. Madam Jin is present though, her face carefully blank. Meng Yao’s hands do not shake as he offers her tea. She does not throw it in his face, and he counts that as his win.</p>
<p>The rest is a blur, and Meng Yao wonders why his vaunted perfect memory chose now to fail him, but when looking back, he’ll remember little else, until the moment when he’s escorted to the bridal chamber to wait for Jin Zixuan. <em>Shijie</em> is there waiting for him instead of at the feast. She’d begged off on account of pregnancy related exhaustion, but there’s none of that in the way she pushes Meng Yao onto the bed and proceeds to kiss him <em>thoroughly.</em></p>
<p>By the time Jin Zixuan gets to his rooms, it’s to find his new husband being kissed senseless, wedding clothes rumpled, by his very pregnant and enthusiastic wife. “I thought you might want to help him out of his robes,” Jiang Yanli says shamelessly from her place on top of Meng Yao. Meng Yao looks up at Jin Zixuan helplessly. He’s just about ready to come in his robes.</p>
<p>Jin Zixuan, in gorgeous wedding robes of his own, hurries to join them, and Meng Yao still has very <em>very </em>vivid memories of the pleasurable marital activities that came after.</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>“Husband,” says Meng Yao in the morning, from his place sandwiched between Jin Zixuan and Jiang Yanli.</p>
<p>“Mm?” asks Jin Zixuan. He shifts a little, against Meng Yao’s back.</p>
<p>“Your son is <em>kicking me,</em>” and if Meng Yao sounds awed instead of annoyed, well. His <em>shijie </em>and her husband’s – <em>his</em> husband, too, now – child was kicking him from inside of Jiang Yanli, where she’s pressed against his front.</p>
<p>“Go to sleep,” Jin Zixuan demands. The baby gives a firm kick in refusal, making Jiang Yanli grimace. Meng Yao watches her wake up, looking disgruntled and exhausted. He presses a kiss to her cheek, and rubs gently at the swell of her belly until the baby quiets, and Jiang Yanli dozes off again. He feels a kiss pressed to his nape from behind. “Thank you, A-Yao,” Jin Zixuan whispers.</p>
<p>“Don’t be silly,” says Meng Yao, and drifts back to sleep, cocooned by his family.</p>
