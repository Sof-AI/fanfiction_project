          <div class="userstuff"><p>
    Every year since he’d rose to become Gym Leader, Raihan organized what he
    lovingly called The Big Losers Party in his suite at the Rose. It was
    usually populated by the occasional trainer that got through the challenge
    – there had been years, like the year before, where no one had gotten
    through, and so the whole Championship tournament had been a Gym Leader
    brawl, much to the delight of some of their sponsors – who happened to be
    old enough to get gloriously drunk with their idols… and well, said idols.
</p><p>
    It was a bit of toothless fun, after the carnage they had all unleashed on
    each other in the stadium. Sure, the first iteration of the party hadn’t
    exactly been awash with booze, if nothing else because Raihan had been
    fifteen at the time and there was something so profoundly disapproving in
    the way Kabu had looked at him when he’d tried to steal a sip of something
    he shouldn’t, that Raihan hadn’t been able to bring himself to do it until
    he was old enough to buy his own damn booze with a straight face. But at
    fifteen he’d already had three defeats too many at Leon’s hands in the
    Championship’s finals and being chosen to represent Hammerlocke and protect
    its Vault was not enough to take off the sting that his first year as Gym
    Leader had been punctuated with another loss to his rival. He’d looked at
    his fellow Gym Leaders, plucked courage out of thin air, and asked them to
    hang out and mope with him. He’d made a point to not invite Leon, because
    of course Leon was not a loser and he had no business watching Raihan lick
    his wounds and compare bruises in his pride with his fellows.
</p><p>
    Leon hadn’t even been mad about it, really. He’d smiled at Raihan about it
    and moved right on with his photoshoots and promotional appearances and
    exhibition matches and all those glittering things he did that slowly
    accrued dozens of logos on his uniform, to the point he’d added a cape to
    hold all of them. Leon got his trophy, Raihan got his party, and about a
    week later they’d meet somewhere nice for dinner after a press conference
    and very pointedly not talk about it.
</p><p>
    It became tradition, the same way Leon’s victory became inevitable in the
    eyes of the region, year after year after year, until without noticing
    almost a whole decade had passed. There were kids signing up for the
    challenge who had been born after Leon became Champion. And every year,
    Raihan would host his party and drink away anything too sharp to be good
    sportsmanship. He would remind himself he really liked his fellow Gym
    Leaders, not merely respected their skill.
</p><p>
    Raihan paid for everything and posted nothing online except the traditional
    group selfie at the beginning of the night, long before anyone did or said
    anything dumb or embarrassing. Very often, karaoke was involved. Three
    years prior, Opal had started a rather damning game of strip poker that had
    been so rigged they hadn’t been able to call her out on it. It was, then,
    very well accepted, that whatever happened at The Big Losers Party stayed
    there. Forever.
</p><p>
    This year, Raihan had made preparations to celebrate Piers’ retirement, but
    wasn’t expecting any new faces to show up. After all, the only four who’d
    managed to get through the challenge and join the finals were Leon’s little
    brother and his friend, the boy from Nessa’s Stadium and… well, the very
    reason that Piers was retiring. Opal hadn’t bothered to show up at all, Bea
    wasn’t old enough to attend, Gordie had decided to answer his phone and was
    stuck trying not to have a meltdown and yell at his mum across the line
    somewhere in the hotel’s lobby… It seemed like it was going to be the usual
    collection of stories and drinking and plans for the next year.
</p><p>
    …except for the bit where Leon had finally met his match in the pitch and
    he was very much not Champion anymore, dethroned not by Raihan or even his
    brother, but his brother’s mousy best friend, who was quiet and kind and
    apparently badass enough to tame a dragon made of sheer poison and hate,
    and then use it to put Leon’s team through its paces. Raihan had wished her
    good luck, because she’d trounced him, twice, but had figured deep down
    she’d lose and perhaps she would end up becoming Galar’s first ever Poison
Gym Leader. Instead, she’d become Galar’s first ever Poison    <em>Champion</em>, and he wasn’t angry so much as shellshocked.
</p><p>
    Raihan found himself going through the motions – herding people back to the
    Rose, riding on the euphoria as Galar realized history had been made that
    day, for the second time in less than a week, even – and then saw Leon
    standing in the lobby, watching his brother and the brand new Champion
    walking towards the elevators with a look on his face best described as
    confused yet proud constipation. He looked ridiculous without the cape,
    Raihan thought, halfway between naked and not wholly there, considering
    he’d ended up wrapping it around the new Champion in the heat of the
    moment, even though it was far too big for a girl that small.
</p><p>
    And then Raihan realized that Leon was no longer Champion, which meant he
    was, for the first time in history, qualified to receive an invitation to
    the party.
</p><p>
    “Yo,” Raihan said, approaching cautiously, “Mr. Ex-Champion.”
</p><p>
    Leon startled before he turned to face Raihan but didn’t bristle even
    though Raihan’s tone was more on the taunting side than anything.
    Realistically, Raihan didn’t expect him to. Leon was the kind of person who
    wouldn’t hold a grudge, he didn’t think. But then, they’d just lost faith
    in one of the pillars of their community, so perhaps Raihan could be
    excused from being wary about how Leon was taking his defeat. In the
    fantasies Raihan was not about to admit he’d ever had; Leon was always
    gracious about the astounding asskicking Raihan would give him. Perhaps a
    bit more than just suitably impressed, even.
</p><p>
    Leon laughed sheepishly, tugging his hat a bit down, as if to hide his
    face.
</p><p>
    “Ah, is it time already?” He asked, though his lips were stubbornly stuck
    on a smile, as beamy an expression as if he’d actually won. “For the
    mocking?”
</p><p>
    Raihan snorted.
</p><p>
    “Nah,” he said, and then threw an arm around Leon’s shoulders, tugging him
    close. “But I’m tempted to make you foot the bill tonight. Upstaging Piers
    at his own retirement party, Lee? That’s cold.”
</p><p>
    Leon blinked, momentarily distracted enough that he followed Raihan’s lead
    without thinking, heading towards a different set of elevators than the
    ones he’d just seen his brother and the Champion disappear into, scant
    minutes prior. Raihan’s party was a tradition, by this point, expected by
    its venue and ready to be catered to. After all, the Rose cared about its
    guests’ comfort and they wouldn’t let Raihan host his party in a regular
    room anymore, not since the unfortunate incident a couple years back with
    the accidental not-fire that nonetheless ended up with Nessa’s dreadnaw
    using surf. Indoors.
</p><p>
    “Piers is retiring?” Leon asked, blinking up at Raihan with genuine
    surprise, and then frowned. “What party?”
</p><p>
    “The Big Losers Party, mate,” Raihan said, giving him the flash-a-fang grin
    that usually got him at least 50K likes in the first ten minutes, whenever
    he posted pictures of it online. “No bigger loser than you tonight, I
    reckon.”
</p><p>
    Leon blinked again and then wrapped an arm around Raihan’s waist, laughing
    as he tugged his hat with the other hand and completely covered his face.
</p><p>
    “Yeah, I guess you’re right.”
</p><p>
    Raihan didn’t tell him that being right was kind of a trademark of his by
    now, mostly because he was busy basking on how well Leon fit under his arm,
    tucked up against his side like that as they stepped into the elevator.
    Alas, the ride was not eternal, and when the ding echoed, announcing they’d
    reached their floor, Raihan pushed Leon ahead of him, one hand firmly on
    the center of his back and proper distance kept again.
</p><p>
    Wouldn’t want to make it weird or anything.
</p>
<hr/><p>
    When Raihan was ten, he’d snuck out of his foster home to face the Gym
    Challenge the first time, with only a trapinch to his name. About twenty
    minutes into his first determined trek into the wild area, he’d stumbled
    into Piers, his zigzagoon and their pot of stew. Raihan remembered trying
    to be clever, and failing miserably, but Piers hadn’t been mad. He’d
    offered Raihan a seat and a bowl, and then called him an idiot for his lack
    of provisions to brave the trip to Motostoke. Raihan hadn’t pointed out the
    fact he didn’t have enough money for the train ride, or better supplies,
    but Piers hadn’t made him say it, either. He’d just sighed and called him
    names, and sort of assumed Raihan would be sticking around for the rest of
    the challenge. Which he had.
</p><p>
    They’d been friends since then, really.
</p><p>
    “You’re a spineless twit,” Piers deadpanned into his beer, watching Raihan
    watch Leon, who had passed out sometime after two and had ended up sprawled
    against Raihan’s side, drooling a massive spot all over Raihan’s thigh.
    “Yearly reminder and all.”
</p><p>
    “You can eat my entire ass, Piers,” Raihan muttered under his breath, then
    reached out to clink his beer with his on reflex. “So what’s next? Gonna
    find a damp, dark cave and hibernate for a decade?”
</p><p>
    “Focus on my music,” Piers said, shrugging. “Got enough one-offs to maybe
    put together a whole album. See if I can find a record label that’s
    interested in it.”
</p><p>
    “Should be easy now,” Raihan pointed out, “with Rose gone.”
</p><p>
    Raihan wasn’t really broken up about it, really. He’d never liked Rose
    personally, not since he’d found out that Piers – and Spikemuth as a whole
    – had been blacklisted by Macro Cosmo after Piers refused to move his
    Stadium to the designated power spot further south. Sure, Rose was an
    institution in Galar, and Raihan’s job as Gym Leader and guardian of the
    Vault meant he was in constant contact with him and many of his various
    companies – hell, the power plant <em>was</em> his primary sponsor – but it
    was just a necessary evil to do his job, as far as Raihan was concerned.
    He’d have cut ties with him, much the same way Piers had, but Piers had
    kicked him – actually kicked him, the noodle-legged ass – and told him to
    stop being stupid.
</p><p>
    Well, Rose was gone now. Or would be. There was no plausible deniability
    this time, no matter how much he owned of Galar’s… everything. He’d
    broadcasted his intentions live on region-wide TV, there was no escaping
    judgment for that. Though what was going to happen to Macro Cosmo was
    anyone’s guess, really.
</p><p>
    That was going to be a nightmare, Raihan reckoned, but a nightmare better
    left for future Raihan to worry about, considering how pleasantly drunk
    present Raihan was at the moment.
</p><p>
    “Maybe,” Piers said, swirling his drink pensively, “maybe not. At least
    Spikemuth is in good hands now.”
</p><p>
    “See, the self-deprecating bullshit would be a lot more believable,” Raihan
    said, squinting at him, “if I didn’t own the three dragons you handily
    knocked out that last match.”
</p><p>
    “Still lost, didn’t I?” But Piers was smiling, that little twitch of lips
    of his that he only ever gave Raihan or Marnie, full of taunting fondness.
</p><p>
    “Yeah, but I’m definitely not someone who’d hold that against you,” Raihan
    pointed out. “It really was a good match, Piers. I’ll miss facing you in
    the field, you know?”
</p><p>
    “You’ll be fine.” Piers’ smile widened into a smirk, taunting and terrible.
    “Between my sis and the Champion, I’m sure the future of your big losers
    party is secure.”
</p><p>
    “Can we not? Just one goddamn night?” Raihan whined, shaking his head. “I’m
    trying to be nice to you, you ass.”
</p><p>
    “Can’t be nice,” Piers deadpanned, chucking his empty beer can across the
    room and at the small pile around the basket in the corner. “I’m allergic.”
</p><p>
    “Get out of here,” Raihan snorted, considering how much Piers cared about…
    well. Everything.
</p><p>
    Everyone.
</p><p>
    Him, even.
</p><p>
    “I really should,” Piers sighed, watching as across the room, Nessa threw
    her hands up in the air with a little shriek of defeat, “there’s a pile of
    Yell grunts sobbing in the lobby and I should probably get them out of
    there before they get arrested.” He snorted. “Please, don’t stand up,” he
    added, clearly amused by Raihan’s predicament.
</p><p>
    Raihan ignored the wave of heat settling on the bridge of his nose and the
    back of his neck.
</p><p>
    “Are we still on for our camping trip?” He asked, valiantly ignoring the
    comment, or the way Leon nuzzled further into his lap.
</p><p>
    He didn’t have to ask, not really. But it was either an inane question like
    that, or risk whatever Piers was thinking about saying, given the look on
    his face. As it was, the now cheerfully – for Piers, anyway – ex-Gym Leader
    snorted and made a point to roll his eyes right where Raihan could see him.
</p><p>
    “Sure, I’ll schedule the world tour around it.”
</p><p>
    He offered Raihan a hand and shook it firmly.
</p><p>
    “Jackass,” Raihan said, profoundly affectionate.
</p><p>
    “Moron,” Piers replied, shaking his head. “Literally just tell him,
    Raihan.”
</p><p>
    “Of course,” Raihan said, though he had absolutely no intention of doing
    anything of the sort. “See you around, Piers.”
</p><p>
    Piers waved at him and wandered over to where Kabu, in Opal’s absence, was
    busy fleecing Gordie, Milo and Nessa in a game of dice that was apparently
    popular in his home region, to offer his own curt goodbyes. Raihan watched
    him go, and then sighed. Sure, he’d promised Piers he’d tell Leon all about
    his feelings, once Leon wasn’t Champion anymore.
</p><p>
    But Raihan had always assumed that would be because he’d be the one to
    dethrone him.
</p><p>
    And he hadn’t been.
</p><p>
    So maybe it didn’t count.
</p><p>
    Probably.
</p><p>
    Yeah.
</p>
<hr/><p>
    In the morning – well, afternoon – Raihan found himself sitting across
    Leon, eating breakfast out of a tray and trying his best to not think about
    anything dumb. Everyone else had left, at some point, walking – or
    stumbling – back to their own rooms, to spend the day nursing their own
    hangovers, moral and otherwise. But Leon had stayed right where he’d passed
    out, curled up on a bed with his head firmly placed in Raihan’s lap. Sleep
    had been scarce for Raihan, obviously. But now it was a bright new day, and
    they’d ordered enough room service to feed themselves and their entire
    teams – which were scattered around the floor, chilling out – and the
    silence was comfortable in a way that was probably going to drive Raihan
    insane.
</p><p>
    “So,” he asked, when he couldn’t take it anymore, “what are you going to do
    now?”
</p><p>
    Leon seemed surprised by the question, but then he smiled. One of those
    goofy, idiot smiles of his that lit up an entire room and made Raihan wish
    he was wearing sunglasses. He looked… happy. Relieved, even. Sure, Raihan
    hadn’t exactly expected him to be bitter about his defeat – Leon was so
    much better than that, obviously – but he wouldn’t have expected him to be
    happy about it.
</p><p>
    “I have no idea,” he said, with an edge of near childish delight. “And it
    feels <em>wonderful.</em>” Then he laughed. “I mean, I should probably find
    some clothes, but that’s… future Leon’s problem.”
</p><p>
    Raihan missed the chance to smile back at him and tease him about stealing
    the phrase from him – it always amused him to watch interviews after he got
    a chance to hang out with Leon, and hear bits and pieces of himself come
    out of his mouth, a firm reminder that Leon cared about their friendship at
    least half as much as Raihan did – mostly because he was too busy frowning
    at him.
</p><p>
    “Why would you need to find clothes?” He blurted out, and immediately knew
    it was the wrong thing to say, when Leon winced.
</p><p>
    Too late to take it back, now, and pretend he’d said nothing.
</p><p>
    “Can’t exactly go out there still wearing the whole Champion getup, can I?”
    Leon tried to laugh it off, but it was awkward. He never sounded awkward in
    public, Raihan reckoned, only when Raihan fucked up things, somehow. “I
    mean, it’ll give people the wrong idea.”
</p><p>
    “So wear something else, then,” Raihan said, mouth still working faster
    than his brain could stop it, blurting every dumb thing that crossed his
    mind.
</p><p>
    “I mean, I would,” Leon said, clearing his throat, “if I owned anything
    else right now.”
</p><p>
    Raihan stared.
</p><p>
    “I wasn’t actually expecting to lose,” Leon pointed out, almost
    defensively. “And it’s been legitimately crazy, since Chairman Rose…
    stepped down,” he added, rather diplomatically. “I just… procrastinated.”
</p><p>
    Raihan stopped staring and started frowning.
</p><p>
    “…are you trying to tell me that if I were to go rummage about in your
    luggage all I’d find are spare Champion uniforms?”
</p><p>
    Leon shrugged.
</p><p>
    “Luggage isn’t the word I’d use,” he said, carefully poking about his plate
    with his fork, rather than meet Raihan’s frown head on. “It makes it sound
    cumbersome. The chairman always said, travel light and you’ll never be
    delayed.”
</p><p>
    Raihan didn’t tell him the chairman could go suck on something phallic.
    Raihan sighed in a frankly Piers-worthy fashion and shook his head.
</p><p>
    “Alright, alright,” he said, reaching out to grab his rotom phone so he
    could tickle its face and browse his contacts. “You’re not allowed to say I
    never do nice things for you, though.”
</p><p>
    Leon laughed.
</p><p>
    “Of course you do nice things for me, Rai, you got me breakfast this
    morning and didn’t throw my drunken ass out into the hallway last night,”
    he said, making a point to count with his fingers. Then he made a noise of
    surprise and nearly fell off the bed, flailing backwards, when Raihan’s
    rotom flew right into his face and started snapping pictures. “Raihan!”
</p><p>
    Leon wasn’t, strictly speaking, wearing anything more substantial than the
    white leggings from his uniform, which wasn’t exactly his ideal for a
    photoshoot.
</p><p>
    “Shush,” Raihan snorted, “so what do you think?” He added, back to the
    phone call Leon hadn’t realized he’d started at some point. “Good enough
    challenge?”
</p><p>
    “He’ll do, I guess,” came the despairing quip, before the call ended with a
    solemn click.
</p><p>
    “…Rai?” Leon asked, wary.
</p><p>
    Raihan grinned, fangs and all.
</p><p>
    “You’ll see.”
</p>
<hr/><p>
    When Raihan inherited Hammerlocke, the scandal had rocked Galar to its
    foundations. A nameless orphan coming out of nowhere to take over the most
    prestigious and historically significant post among the Gym Leaders had
    basically everyone with a pulse and access to the internet screaming out
their feelings about it. He was too young. He was too weak. He was too…    <em>not good enough</em>.
</p><p>
    He hadn’t really cared.
</p><p>
    He still super didn’t, really.
</p><p>
    But then they’d shifted to question his mentor, argue she’d been the one
    who’d gone wrong, in choosing him, and then he’d really cared. Because she
    was a cranky, ruthless, frankly evil <em>witch</em> who deeply delighted in
    all the terrible hoops she made him jump through, primarily for her
    amusement, but she had been a fantastic Gym Leader. She had been more than
    good enough. She had been the best. And if she’d trusted him with her
    Stadium and her duraludon, Raihan would make damn sure to show he more than
    deserve it.

    He might not have been Champion of Galar – yet, always, ominous, hanging in the
    background, <em>yet</em> – but he <em>had been</em>, and still was, the best Gym Leader in
    Galar.
</p><p>
    Around the time he’d decided to show the world exactly how good he was at
    his job, he’d met a young man from Kalos, with big dreams and ideas about
    fashion, who’d come to Hammerlocke to get himself a dragon companion to
    define his brand. Raihan had initially dismissed him, much the same way he
    dismissed most of the requests that came to the Stadium, regarding hopeful
    prospects looking to get themselves one of Galar’s prized dragons as part
    of their teams. Wild dragons were in decline all over the region, and had
    been for almost a century, so the sensible thing had been done, and
    catching them or in any way threatening their habitat had been heavily
    criminalized. If anyone in Galar wanted a dragon in their team, they had to
    come to Hammerlocke Stadium, pass the Gym Leader’s rigorous vetting process
    and, if successful, wait their turn to have one bred specially for them.
</p><p>
    Raihan certainly enjoyed fighting much more than the breeding duties as Gym
    Leader, but he nonetheless took them seriously.
</p><p>
    The young man from Kalos had faced Raihan’s trials and failed them
    thoroughly, and so Raihan had sent him away, emptyhanded. A year later,
    when the scandal about Raihan had been finally obscured by the scandal
    about Piers inheriting Spikemuth Stadium after his mum died – never let it
    be said Raihan didn’t know or appreciate the many ways Piers had saved his
    ass over the years – the young man returned, better prepared this time.
    Raihan was a sucker for hard work and people who committed to their dreams,
    so after faring so much better on the trial the second time, the young man
    was placed on the waiting list. A year after <em>that</em>, Raihan plopped
    a baby deino in his arms and sent him on his way with the best wishes.
</p><p>
    That young man was Henri Levy, chief designer, conceptual artist and owner
    of what would become three of Galar’s most well-known fashion brands:
    DENSOKU, Celebrity and Jetsetter. All three, some of Raihan’s more vocal
    sponsors.
</p><p>
    He was also the person who fell upon Raihan’s suite and more specifically,
    Leon, like a swarm of angry yanmegas, along with his dozen assistants and
    their three million racks of clothes.
</p><p>
    “Rai?” Leon asked plaintively, lying on the floor exactly at ground zero of
    what could be best described as a fashion explosion.
</p><p>
    “Mmm?” Raihan replied, sitting on the same corner of the bed from where
    he’d witnessed the entire tornado touchdown, slurping noisily out of a
    frappuccino cup.
</p><p>
    “Please never be nice to me again,” Leon whined, hiding his face under his
    hat, the only true survivor of the whole ordeal.
</p><p>
    Raihan laughed.
</p>
<hr/><p>
    Every year, at the end of summer, Raihan and Piers took two whole weeks off
    and pissed off into the vast wilderness that was the Lake of Outrage.
</p><p>
    Strictly speaking, this wasn’t time off for Raihan, considering the Lake of
    Outrage was the largest dragon habitat in Galar so it was kind of his job
    to make sure it was doing alright. He dropped by every other weekend, just
    to make sure dens and nests were undisturbed and no one got the bright idea
    to bypass the ban on catching dragons or some other nonsense. It was just
    that, in the summer, instead of making the rounds and just going home, he
    setup camp and let his team stretch out and do their thing. He’d always
    been told that one couldn’t just… go and stay in the Lake of Outrage alone,
    because it would be dangerous, so, the very first year, he’d invited Piers
    along. And then the year after that, and the one after that, on and on,
    until it was as traditional as The Big Losers Party, even if Piers
    complained about the sun and the sandstorms – the most fucking gorgeous
    sandstorms in the entirety of Galar, those – and every little thing he
    could think of, because Piers considered bitching the central core of his
    personality.
</p><p>
    Still, it was nice, sitting around the fire, listening to Piers strum his
    guitar while the sky lit up with a million stars that were never visible
    from Hammerlocke.
</p><p>
    “<em>And if you’d only tell him how you feel</em>,” Piers sang, apparently
    the acoustic version of the song that had spearheaded his very first record
    deal. He paused and stared at Raihan until Raihan looked at him, and then
    he rolled his eyes with a flourish. “You fucking useless coward,” he
deadpanned, and then went back to the song, as Raihan cracked a laugh. “    <em>Maybe it wouldn’t be just in your head!</em>”
</p><p>
    “Eat the whole of my ass, Piers.”
</p><p>
    “When I left, he was in your bed,” Piers pointed out, putting down the
    guitar to properly stare at Raihan with all due exasperation. “His head was
in your lap, Raihan. He was wearing leggings and a hat.    <em>How the hell did you screw that up?</em>”
</p><p>
    “I wasn’t just gonna feel him up or something weird,” Raihan snapped back,
    defensive, and immediately felt the squelchy weight of goodra crawling up
    to slump on his shoulders and try to soothe his temper.
</p><p>
    “Obviously,” Piers snorted, “but you could have had a conversation in the
    morning.”
</p><p>
    “Which we did, thanks,” Raihan snarled petulantly, and got himself a
    chirring goodra nuzzling up against his face for his trouble. Raihan raised
    a hand to pet her face reassuringly. “We had a lovely breakfast and then he
    mentioned he needed clothes, so I helped with that, and then we amicably
    parted ways. Because we’re friends. And rivals.”
</p><p>
    “But not lovers,” Piers retorted mercilessly. “Because you’re a coward.”
</p><p>
    “Or,” Raihan snapped, “hear me out, maybe because he just doesn’t like me
    that way!” He threw his arms up in the air. “Because that’s a thing, Piers!
    That could happen! You don’t know!”
</p><p>
    “I mean, we would, if you grew a spine and asked him out,” Piers deadpanned
    right back. “But you won’t. ‘cause you’re a coward.”
</p><p>
    “Don’t you have a song to practice,” Raihan hissed at him, face flushed –
    the bits that weren’t covered in goo, at least. “Or something?”
</p><p>
    “I do, actually,” Piers snickered. “Got a new single coming out, along with
    the tour. It’s called <em>Hit Himself In Confusion</em>. I’m sure it’s
    gonna be a crowd pleaser.”
</p><p>
    It was a lovely song, honestly. Raihan was sure it was going to debut into
    the top 5, just like all of Piers’ singles had.
</p><p>
    It was just unfortunate that he was never going to be able to hear it
    without feeling the irrational urge to strangle his best friend and feed
    him to a haxorus. Possibly Leon’s haxorus at that. It hadn’t been a picky
    eater as an axew, from what Raihan remembered. And Leon was a friend – only
    a friend! – so he would probably do Raihan a favor without asking too many
    questions.
</p><p>
    Then again, Marnie would be sad.
</p><p>
    Damn.
</p><p>
    Across the fire, Piers sang and played his music and continued to give
    Raihan murder-inducing judging looks. Like always, there was a sizable
    crowd of noivern in the periphery, for lack of better wording, charmed by
    Piers’ music in a way that Raihan had long given up trying to explain to
    anyone who didn’t know how fundamentally meanspirited the damn things could
    be, despite the way they flocked around Piers and playfully chirred bits and pieces of
    his songs back at him for his trouble.
</p><p>
    So all in all, everything was just the way it had always been, and
    apparently the way it was always going to be.
</p><p>
    Right.
</p>
<hr/><p>
    Raihan hadn’t sat down more than ten minutes in the nice reception hall for
    the power plant, when Leon came to meet him, waving enthusiastically as
    always. He stood up, grinning at his friend, but before Leon reached him,
    his phone started buzzing and he excused himself to take the call. He
    watched as Leon’s face froze in surprise, even though he recovered quickly
    and laughed, assuring whoever he was speaking with that there was no
    problem.
</p><p>
    “What,” Raihan asked, as soon as he hung up.
</p><p>
    Leon was no longer Champion, but he was now the designated successor for
    Chairman Rose for reasons that, honestly, Raihan didn’t really understand
    and wasn’t all that interested in. But even his new role – and the endless
    headliners that came with it, which Raihan read because he kept up with the
    news, not because he was a stalker or something – didn’t change their
    standing arrangement to meet every quarter. They had always squeezed a
    dinner or a lunch somewhere in the schedule, while Leon, then Champion, now
    apparently Chairman or Chairman-in-training or Chairman-hopeful or whatever
    the right term was, went about figuring out budgets and priorities and a
    whole lot of boring things that Macro Cosmo needed to deal with, to better
    support the League. Raihan couldn’t quite remember when that had started,
    really, but it became a nice habit for him to agonize about during the
    interim months, often with Piers’ deadpan commentary to go with it.
</p><p>
    “It’s okay, apparently they accidentally scheduled my reservation for next
    week,” Leon replied, shaking his head. “So… maybe raincheck on this? I need
    to find a hotel room for the night, but I’ll make it up to you.” He laughed
    sheepishly. “At least Gloria’s reservations were okay, and she’s not flying
    in until the day after tomorrow anyway.”
</p><p>
    Raihan gave him a slightly skeptical look and chose not to ask for
    clarification on the method of transport behind that statement, because he
    liked sleeping at night and not spending that time staring at the ceiling
    as he contemplated the fact their reigning Champion liked treating the
    monstrous dragon of poison and hate that had nearly destroyed the world as
    freaking taxi service.
</p><p>
    “I’m pretty sure if you called the hotel management, they’d sort it out for
    you,” he said, eyebrows arched curiously. “You’re not Champion anymore,
    Lee, but it’s not like you’re no one all of a sudden.”
</p><p>
    “Yeah, but I could get someone fired for that,” Leon said, shrugging
    awkwardly. “It’s not a big deal. I just… have to find somewhere to crash
    for the next few days and maybe try not to get lost on the way back to the
    Stadium.”
</p><p>
    Raihan realized the stupidity he was about to commit far too late to stop
    himself.
</p><p>
    “Or,” he said, reaching out to shove Leon’s arm playfully, “you could let
    your dashing rival bear the great burden of putting a roof over your hat
    and let you peruse my outrageously comprehensive take out menu. Bonus
    round, I’ll even get your hopeless ass to work on time come morning, too.”
</p><p>
    Leon tugged his hat down, half obscuring his face.
</p><p>
    “I…” He began, as Raihan braced for the inevitable polite but firm
    rejection. “That sounds great, Rai,” Leon said instead, seemingly slumping
    a bit in relief. “But are you sure it’s not too much trouble?”
</p><p>
    “Nah,” Raihan replied, barely managing to keep ridiculous, unnecessary glee
    from his voice as he leaned back on his seat. “That’s what friends are for,
    Lee.”
</p><p>
    Because they were friends, of course. Rivals, first and foremost, always,
    but they’d known each other for too long and their rivalry was always
    fierce but amicable at the end of the day. It wasn’t like with Piers, of
    course, Raihan thought with a bit of self-deprecation, who was less of a
    friend and more of a brother at this point: phone calls and texts and
    photos and an eternal string of snarky quips wound up in a conversation
    that seemed to have been going on for a decade now. He didn’t know Leon
    nearly as well, nor he presumed to be so close to him… but they’d been
    rivals for ages now, and they’d worked together in some capacity within the
    League for another small eternity. They had drinks and dinners and lunches
    together, and last time they’d met Leon had woken up in Raihan’s bed and
    not been immediately distressed by that.
</p><p>
    So yes, friends.
</p><p>
    Raihan refused to contemplate the ridiculous knot stuck somewhere under his
    sternum when Leon beamed brightly at him.
</p><p>
    “Thanks, Rai,” he said, with the same grace he used to receive his trophy
    at the end of each Championship tournament. “You’re the best.”
</p><p>
    “I try,” Raihan replied, because he did, while inwardly promising himself a
    very cathartic scream into a pillow once Leon’s business trip was over.
</p>
<hr/><p>
    Technically speaking, Raihan lived less than ten meters away from the
    Hammerlocke Stadium.
</p><p>
    Technically.
</p><p>
    His house was out of the way of the busy streets that surrounded the front
    of the Stadium, instead tucked away right behind it, inside a very small
    alleyway that connected Raihan’s house with a larger street full of shops
    and cafes that was still significantly more lowkey than the main street.
    One could, if so inclined, hoist themselves up the tall backyard wall and,
    provided one knew how to land without breaking every bone in their legs,
    casually land in the Stadium’s employee smoking area. Raihan could neither
    confirm nor deny doing that whenever he slept in and didn’t have time to
    run around the Stadium to enter through the main door. He could also not
    say with any certainty if it was precisely the ability to do that what had
    convinced to end up buying the house, once he realized he was going to stay
    in Hammerlocke forever.
</p><p>
    It was a nice house, though.
</p><p>
    Raihan would call it quaint, if forced to describe it. Piers called it a
    pretentious hipster nightmare with dragon window decals on top, but Piers
    was a goddamn asshole who knew nothing of anything ever, so Raihan very
    pointedly didn’t ask for his opinion. Ever. Especially not on dragon window
    decals.
</p><p>
    “Don’t mind the mess,” Raihan said, stepping back to let Leon in first, and
    then closed the door behind himself, throwing the keys into a nice crystal
    bowl that Opal had given him for his birthday a few years prior. Raihan was
    almost sure all of Opal’s gifts were actually just her attempts at spring
    cleaning, but he knew better than to say so out loud. “Just… make yourself
    at home.”
</p><p>
    He chose to let Leon get his bearings – and not stand there and fret about
    every little twitch in Leon’s expression, wondering what he thought of
    Raihan’s home – and instead continued with his routine as usual: crossing
    the small foyer and into the living room to fling the glass doors wide open
    into the sizable patch of grass that was the actual reason Raihan had
    decided to buy the house in the first place. He stretched at the doorway,
    fingers easily touching the ceiling as he did, and then reached out for the
    pokeballs hooked on his belt and released his team out into the garden to
    let them stretch themselves and settle in for the night.
</p><p>
    “You can let your guys stretch out too, if you want,” Raihan said, risking
    to look around and see what Leon’s face looked like, “reckon they must be
    bored as hell in their balls since you took over the desk job, huh?”
</p><p>
    “Two hours,” Leon said, one eyebrow arched. He chuckled wryly when Raihan
    blinked at him. “You gave me an axew and a dreepy and told me I needed to
    give them two hours of my undivided attention, every day.” He laughed.
    “Each!”
</p><p>
    “Well, you should,” Raihan replied, shrugging. “Bored dragons are
    destructive dragons.”
</p><p>
    “They are,” Leon chuckled and walked over to release his own team with a
    content little smile. “Mind, the Chairman didn’t… mind it, as much, but now
    that he’s gone and it’s just me versus the board? They don’t get why I need
    six hours for my pokemon every day. I’m not Champion anymore, but it’s like
    they expect me to quit training all together and just… take the desk job.”
</p><p>
    “It’s been hard, huh,” Raihan said, a little lamely, because that was the
    kind of dumb overstatement that he often found himself making in Leon’s
    presence. “Here, let me show you your room and then you can tell me what
    you’re in the mood for, for dinner.”
</p><p>
    “Thank you,” Leon said, beaming again like a goddamn beacon guiding ships
    to shore, “really, Rai. You’re a life saver.”
</p><p>
    “It’s not that big of a deal,” Raihan insisted, purposely looking away from
    such blinding light. “I mean, Piers complains that my guestroom is
    intolerable, but that’s just Piers being Piers. I think.” Leon stopped
    midway up the stairs, but started walking up them again, when Raihan
    realized he wasn’t following anymore. “Okay, full disclosure, my guest room
    is actually my study, but there’s nothing wrong with the bed, I promise.
Piers just has a pathological need to bitch relentlessly about    <em>everything</em>.”
</p><p>
    “I’m sure it’s perfect,” Leon replied, almost placating. He licked his
    lips. “I didn’t know you and Piers were so close.”
</p><p>
    “I don’t know if close is the right word for it,” Raihan snorted. “Or maybe
    it is,” he went on, opening the door to let Leon inside, “because I’m this
    close,” he gestured, holding his thumb and his index finger almost close
    enough to touch, “to yeeting his smug ass face into the nearest river
    sometimes.”
</p><p>
    “Oh,” Leon said, clearly not sure if Raihan meant what he’d said or not.
</p><p>
    Raihan snorted.
</p><p>
    “We’re close like you and Sonia are close, yeah? Or your baby brother and
    the champ,” he explained with a little shrug. “You know, Gym Challenge
    mates.”
</p><p>
    “Oh,” Leon said, again, holding onto his luggage – he had luggage now, and
    clothes that weren’t a uniform and definitely screamed <em>Henri</em>, too,
    which filled Raihan with an aimless, wordless feeling he didn’t know what
    to name – and then shrugged. “I didn’t know,” he added, ducking his head in
    embarrassment, “I don’t… I don’t remember ever fighting Piers before he
    became Gym Leader. Or after.” He frowned. “I don’t think I ever had a
    single exhibition match with him either.”
</p><p>
    “’course you didn’t,” Raihan laughed, clearing up the desk in the room to
    make sure Leon had enough space. “Before he inherited, the lazy ass
    couldn’t be bothered to actually finish the Gym Challenge. Made it all the
    way to his mum, and then stopped after she chewed him up and spat him out
    on the first attempt. Then… y’know, he had to inherit, but there was the
    whole thing with Rose.”
</p><p>
    “What <em>thing</em> with Rose?”
</p><p>
    Raihan looked up at the sharpness of Leon’s tone. Before, whenever the
    ex-Chairman was mentioned, Leon was apologetic, almost… regretfully fond of
    him. He did not sound like that at all, then.
</p><p>
    “Spikemuth doesn’t have a dynamaxing power spot in it, but it’s as
    ancestral as Hammerlocke or Circhester, as far as seats of the Gym Challenge
    go, so he couldn’t just… move the Stadium. Not without the approval of the
    Gym Leader.” Raihan shrugged and turned back to the mess of papers and
    cables scattered around his laptop, set on tiding it up. “Piers’ mum told
    Rose she’d die before she let him move her stadium. Then she did die, and
    when Piers inherited, all he knew for sure about being a Gym Leader, was
    that his mum had promised to sic a pack of feral linoone on Rose if he ever
    set foot on Spikemuth again.”
</p><p>
    Raihan sighed and reached out for one of the few picture frames he kept on
    his desk, of Piers and himself, around the time of their first Gym
    Challenge, and Piers’ mum ruffling their hair and grinning wider than the
    two of them combined. He smiled at it for a moment, before he offered it to
    Leon, so he could take a look.
</p><p>
    “So Rose came in, all charming and personable and told Piers the future of
    Spikemuth depended on him moving to a new Stadium forty miles south, in the
    middle of nowhere, and just… abandon Spikemuth proper for good. Called the
    project Neo Spikemuth or something stupid like that.” He rolled his eyes.
    “Piers told him exactly where he could stuff his project, so Rose
    blacklisted him.”
</p><p>
    Raihan chuckled bitterly when he heard Leon inhale sharply, as the
    implications sank in. No one could sponsor Piers without risking their
    entire business going under once Rose found out and pulled all support from
    under them. And of course, Rose had made every effort he could to keep
    Piers alienated from all official League events, including opening
    ceremonies, exhibition matches and the like.
</p><p>
    “Rai, I had no idea-“
</p><p>
    “I know you didn’t,” Raihan sighed, taking the picture back from Leon and
    placing it on the desk. “Honestly, he didn’t want anyone to know. I found
    out by accident, and when I told him it was bullshit and that I was going
    on strike to support Spikemuth he kicked me in the ankles ‘cause he’s too
    short to do anything else, except maybe headbutt my solar plexus.” Raihan
    laughed fondly, but it was also… resigned. Maybe a little bitter. “He said
    I was responsible for upholding the legacy I had inherited alongside my
    title, just like he did, and we had to do it our own way.” Leon was still
    looking at him with an expression Raihan had only ever seen in the heat of
    battle, serious and withdrawn, contemplating what the next move was to
    completely outdo his opponent. Raihan looked away. “Look, it worked out in
    the end, anyway. He outlasted Rose. Now he’s back to doing what he really
    wanted to do all his life and his sister is in charge of the Gym and doing
    a fantastic job, and we have someone honorable finally cleaning up after
    Rose’s bullshit.”
</p><p>
    “Raihan,” Leon said, and despite the fact he was wearing something
    decidedly less flashy than his old Champion uniform, never mind the cape,
    he looked as fierce and ready to fight as he’d always looked, standing
    across the field in one of their matches. “I’m-“
</p><p>
    “Aaah, forget about it, Lee,” Raihan said, reaching out to squeeze one of
    Leon’s shoulders reassuringly. “It’s okay! Let’s go downstairs and see what
    we can order for dinner.” When Leon remained where he was, feet firmly
    planted as if he were right in the middle of a stadium, Raihan looped a
    friendly arm around his neck and tugged him along, almost like a half-hug.
    “I’d offer to cook for you, but I don’t actually want you dead, so you’ll
    just have to trust me that I’m putting all my heart into it when I’m paying
    with my phone.”
</p><p>
    For a moment, Raihan wondered if Leon was going to pull back and refuse to
    drop the subject. He wondered what he’d do, and what new stupid things his
    mouth was going to blather on uncontrollably if pressed. He never knew when
    to shut the hell up, when Leon was around. It was embarrassing, really.
</p><p>
    “You keep posting pictures of the rainbow pasta,” Leon said, almost
    sheepish, just as he slid under Raihan’s arm and allowed himself to be
    tugged away from the room, “and you keep not saying what it is… so maybe we
    could order that?”
</p><p>
    “Chairman Leon!” Raihan jeered, smile full of teeth, tugging him closer and
    reaching with his free hand to tug at Leon’s hat, “are you a stalker? Is
    this a confession?”
</p><p>
    Leon laughed, and shoved him off playfully.
</p><p>
    “No!” He stomped down the stairs, and stopped at the last step, before he
    looked up at Raihan. “…okay, maybe a little.” Raihan ignored the way his
    heart tripped over itself and ended up lodged up his throat. “Your rotom
    takes really good pictures.”
</p><p>
    Raihan threw his arms up in the air dramatically.
</p><p>
    “Betrayal! Outrage!” He said, looking away. “I’m gonna hang out with flygon
    now, who loves for me, and not how many megapixels I can afford.”
</p><p>
    Leon laughed at his antics, though, the same full, energized laugh as
    always, and the sound was good enough for Raihan to forget about all the
    stupid things he’d said or done all day.
</p><p>
    It was fine.
</p>
<hr/><p>
    Raihan had been busy trying to contain erratic dynamaxing pokemon, when the
    battle against The Darkest Day was raging on above his Stadium. So he’d
    never gotten a really good look at the thing, before.
</p><p>
    It certainly made an impression as it landed into the field, its skeletal
    body unfurling with a roar as it settled enough to allow its rider to slide
    off its back.
</p><p>
    “So,” Raihan said, hands stuck in the pockets of his hoodie, “not only did
    you manage to tame the doom dragon of poison and hate, you’re actually
    using it as a taxi now.” He made a point to pat Leon’s back placatingly as
    he flashed the young Champion a fanged grin. “Mate, you’ve been thoroughly
    out staged.”
</p><p>
    “Well, he hates being stuck inside a pokeball,” Gloria said, almost
    sheepish, but dutifully turned around to give said doom dragon of poison
    and hate <em>head scritches</em>, because apparently that was a thing that
    it liked. “And the only corviknight I know that likes flying alongside him
    is Hop’s, so…” She shrugged at Raihan just as dramatically and gave Leon a
    taunting look. “It just be that way sometimes.”
</p><p>
    “Gloria,” Leon said, in the pained tones of a mentor trying desperately not
    to laugh, “that’s still not an acceptable Champion catch-phrase.”
</p><p>
    “I know, I know,” she sighed, and then shrugged before leaning over to
    mock-whisper at Raihan, “but it really just be that way sometimes.”
</p><p>
    “I feel you,” Raihan teased, grinning back at her. “But you gotta let Leon
    have a <em>Chairman</em> time, after all.”
</p><p>
    “Okay, okay, that’s enough you two,” Leon said, clapping like a
    schoolteacher trying to make a rowdy classroom settle down. “You’re getting
    along dangerously well.”
</p><p>
    “Alright,” Gloria agreed, waving her hands lightly. “Raihan, do you mind if
    Nat stays here and takes a nap? He’s basically an overgrown purrloin, he
    just wants to sunbathe all day.”
</p><p>
    “Sure,” Raihan said, “I’ll just make sure to let everyone know to give… you
    nicknamed the doom dragon of poison and hate <em>Nat</em>.”
</p><p>
    Gloria beamed at him, as innocently as she had, right after she was done
    destroying his team with a merciless application of venoshock and toxic
    spikes.
</p><p>
    “Yup.”
</p><p>
    “Today’s just gonna be amazing, isn’t it?” Raihan asked no one in
    particular, but couldn’t help but bask in the obvious pride and excitement
    that Leon had about his successor, for all he chided her gently in places.
</p><p>
    It just be that way sometimes… indeed.
</p>
<hr/><p>
    “But why do you let them bully you?” Raihan asked, somewhere around two in
    the morning and well into his ninth beer can of the night, sprawled as long
    as he was on the couch, watching Leon pace erratically around the room.
</p><p>
    “Because it’s the board!” Leon ranted on, throwing his hands up in the air.
    “That’s what they do, honestly. They’re a bunch of extremely rich twits
    with zero connection to reality, and believe me, I am keenly aware of how
    ironic it is for me to say that!”
</p><p>
    “But they work for you now,” Raihan insisted, trying to roll around so he
    could properly follow Leon’s circuit around the small table in the center
    of the living room, where at some point they’d started to pile up their
    cans for no other reason that every drunk person always reached that point
    instinctively somewhere after half past stupid o’clock.
</p><p>
    “What?” Leon stopped abruptly, swayed dangerously in place, and then turned
    to frown at Raihan. “Of course they don’t, Rai. Haven’t you heard a word
    I’ve said? They’re the board! They own Macro Cosmo’s entire conglomerate.”
</p><p>
    “In theory, yeah,” Raihan agreed, and regretted nodding when he almost
    slipped off the couch on inertia. “But you just said Rose rewrote your
    contracts at some point, so as Champion, you were only paid in shares of
    Macro Cosmo, so he could overrule the board whenever he wanted.”
</p><p>
    “Well, yes,” Leon scowled, “but I’m not Champion anymore.”
</p><p>
    “Right,” Raihan said, and nodded again, because he was too drunk to not be
    stupid. “But Rose bequeathed his entire share portfolio on you, before he
    got arrested, and everyone decided to let it stand for the sake of avoiding
    a disastrous PR nightmare, right?”
</p><p>
    “You don’t have to remind me,” Leon grumbled, digging his hands into his
    hair and ruffling it in frustration.
</p><p>
    “Kinda have to, Lee,” Raihan insisted, “because don’t Rose’s portfolio and
    your own as ex-Champion, together, mean you have controlling shares of the
    entire conglomerate?”
</p><p>
    Leon was silent for a long moment.
</p><p>
“Oh,” he said, as he gingerly allowed himself to sit down on the floor. “    <em>Oh</em>.”
</p><p>
    “<em>Mhm</em>,” Raihan purred, rather pleased with himself and how smart he
    was.
</p><p>
    “Holy shit, Rai,” Leon whispered, “you’re <em>right</em>.”
</p><p>
    “It’s my thing, Lee,” Raihan slurred almost chirpily. “Being right and the
    best, that’s me.” He stretched a leg and nudged Leon’s shoulder with his
    foot and somehow managed not to roll off the couch in the process. “They
    can’t bully you, the work for you.”
</p><p>
    “They work for me,” Leon repeated, staring blankly at his hands.
</p><p>
    Raihan didn’t remember what else they talked about, as the night
    progressed, but he did wake up with a passed-out Leon sprawled all over
    him, like a living blanket. Raihan decided he was entirely too hungover to
    deal with that, and forced himself to go back to sleep so he could let Leon
    wake up first and decide what to do.
</p><p>
    It was less awkward that way, obviously.
</p>
<hr/><p>
    “You gave him keys to your house.”
</p><p>
    Raihan buried his face into the cushions of his couch, mostly because he
    wanted to die, not because he was weird and trying to catch a sniff of the
    last remnants of Leon’s cologne in it or something creepy like that.
    Obviously.
</p><p>
    “Shut up, Piers.”
</p><p>
    Piers lowered the picture – Leon, Raihan and Gloria, pulling Leon’s old
    Charizard pose to commemorate the successful end of Leon’s visit to
    Hammerlocke, with Nat, former destroyer of worlds and devourer of all,
    sprawled shamelessly upside down, snoring away his cares in the background
    – and looked down at Raihan with enough disdain it was like a physical
    weight on his shoulders.
</p><p>
    “You gave him <em>keys</em> to your house,” Piers insisted, before putting
    the frame back on the small table, where all of Raihan’s pictures had
    miraculously migrated to, after Leon gave him that one as a thank you gift
    for letting him stay. “You are the most useless sack of stupid I have ever
    met in my entire life.”
</p><p>
    “He’s my friend!” Raihan whined, voice muffled into the fabric as he pulled
    another cushion and covered his head with it, willing himself to merge into
    the couch like goodra often did into the little kiddie pool he kept for her
    out in the garden. “Just. A good friend.”
</p><p>
    “I can see that,” Piers snickered, utterly meanspirited, “what with you not
    fucking him on your couch and all.”
</p><p>
    “Friends don’t fuck their friends on their couch, Piers,” Raihan hissed at
    him, even though he knew exactly what he was about to walk into, as this
    was by then a well-choreographed disaster of a conversation.
</p><p>
    “I mean,” Piers said, coming to sit on the armrest of the couch, smugness
    dripping off his voice, “there was that one time we-“
</p><p>
    “We did, Piers,” Raihan snarled, one eye peering over his arm to fix his
    friend with his best withering glare. “And immediately afterwards you
    decided you never wanted to have sex with any human being ever again.”
</p><p>
    Piers snickered, again.
</p><p>
    Raihan considered reaching out and strangling him, also again.
</p><p>
    “I know you need to be the absolute center of attention basically always,”
    Piers said, in that same patient older brother tone he used whenever Marnie
    threw a tantrum, “but my asexuality has pretty much nothing to do with how
    bad you are at sex, Raihan.”
</p><p>
    “I am fucking amazing at sex,” Raihan hissed, taking a swipe at Piers that
    Piers, predictably, dodged. “Eat my entire ass, Piers.”
</p><p>
    “Second verse, same as the first,” Piers snickered, “still not my thing,
    Raihan. Want me to call Leon and ask if he’s interested, though?”
</p><p>
    “Don’t you have a concert to rehearse for? A region-wide tour to open?”
</p><p>
    Piers did the absolute worst thing he could do, like the impossibly
    annoying asshole he was: he reached a hand and patted Raihan’s head.
</p><p>
    “But we’re <em>friends</em>, Raihan,” he said, pulling his hand back just
    in the nick of time, dodging Raihan’s attempt to bite him. “If I’m not here
    to call you a goddamn cowardly idiot, who will?”
</p><p>
    Raihan melted back into the couch, and went back to doing the sensible,
    mature thing: pile cushions over his head and avoid thinking about what
    Leon might do, now that he had keys to Raihan’s home.
</p><p>
    “I hate you, so much.”
</p><p>
    Piers, because he was literally the worst human being on the whole wide
    world, laughed.
</p><p>
    The bastard.
</p>
<hr/><p>
    New Year came and went.
</p><p>
    At some point during his second quarter as
    no-longer-Champion-but-actually-Chairman-lite, Leon got himself a rotom
    phone like a civilized person. According to him, it was a necessity born
    primarily out of the endless ribbing that came from the Champion and his
    brother. Raihan didn’t know how Leon had gone so long without one, since
    the thought of not having his own floating somewhere within arm reach was
    distressing enough. Maybe, he’d teased him upon hearing the news, now he’d
    have no excuse to get lost, what with the talking GPS. Leon had sent him a
    selfie for that, sticking his tongue out at him childishly, rather than
    type out a reply.
</p><p>
    They talked a lot more often, as a result.
</p><p>
    It was an unending nightmare of anxiety, as far as Raihan was concerned,
    and he wanted it to never end. Leon followed basically none of the
    well-established, well-known social rules of texting. He used full
    sentences and precise punctuation and a combination of emojis that
    practically required a degree in digital cryptography to understand. He
    sent the weirdest, most out of context pictures and selfies, and he had a
    terrible habit of sending Raihan opening sentences and then not reply back
    for hours. It was maddening.
</p><p>
    Still, they talked <em>more</em>.
</p><p>
    They had been friends, before. Good ones, in Raihan’s humble opinion. They
    had their quarterly lunches or dinners and they talked about battles and
    pokemon and the League. Raihan had never met anyone in his life who was as
    excited and committed to pokemon battles as he was, before he issued his
    first public challenge to dethrone Leon and Leon had actually come find him
    to formally accept his rivalry intentions. When Leon confided in him that
    he was looking to include dragons in his roster, Raihan had put him through
    the trials and then agonized for months on which of the baby dragons in his
    care was best suited for Leon to raise. They talked dragons and pokemon and
    challengers and just how much they enjoyed their battles. Raihan was sure
    the main reason he’d never grown bitter, despite the endless string of
    defeats at Leon’s hands, was because Leon would sit with him across a table
    and gush for hours about those battles and how hard Raihan made him work
    for that victory.
</p><p>
    It was a solid base to build a friendship, dragons and battles and their
    lifelong – Raihan hoped – rivalry. But now there was so much <em>more</em>
    to it.
</p><p>
    He’d never known that Leon was a sucker for a good pun, for example. Or
    that he liked tea, more than coffee. Or that he’d been using the same
    corviknight taxi to ferry him around Galar for the past nine years, and
    that he was the official namesake and godfather of the driver’s now
    four-year-old son. Or that he had never seen a milotic in the wild.
</p><p>
    Leon shared things easily, with that offhand clumsiness of his that often
    left Raihan reeling about implications and occasionally inhaling a drink in
    surprise. Of course, the only thing he could do was share right back, often
    thoughtlessly and with a minute freak out after every single reply.
</p><p>
    Still, if it was only texting and the occasional selfie, Raihan would be
    fine.
</p><p>
    Really.
</p><p>
    “Did you know there’s literally no reason why ultraballs are black and
    yellow other than the lead designer being an umbreon fan?”
</p><p>
The problem was that Leon called, sometimes, and rotom would just    <em>answer</em> him, the wispy little traitor, so Raihan would find himself
    bombarded by a conversation without appropriate preparation.
</p><p>
    “Huh,” Raihan said, blinking up at his rotom, “that actually makes a lot of
    sense.” Then he remembered what he was doing, when a fully grown, grumpy
    kommo-o huffed at him. “Oh crap.”
</p><p>
    “It’s bonkers,” Leon went on, utterly unaware of the precarious mess Raihan
    was stuck in, trying to take a batch of eggs away from a nest, right under
    said nest’s guardian’s nose. “We could have custom colored ultraballs,
    Rai.”
</p><p>
    “Baby, that’s wonderful,” Raihan blurted out without thinking, keeping
    steady eye contact with the increasingly irritated kommo-o, “but I’m gonna
    have to call you back when I’m not about to get a hyper beam to the face.”
</p><p>
    “Wha-“
</p><p>
    Rotom, mercifully, ended the call at that point. Didn’t connect Leon’s
    incoming calls either, until Raihan had walked out of the enclosure for the
    last time, and the full clutch of eggs was safe and sound in their
    individual incubators.
</p><p>
    “Hi,” Raihan said, once he was sitting down and finished with a much-needed
    energy drink for the nerves, “sorry about that. What were you saying about
    ultraballs?”
</p><p>
    “Actually, can we talk about the hyper beam first?” Leon replied, sounding
    concerned.
</p><p>
    Raihan chuckled.
</p><p>
    “It’s fine, I was just… y’know, taking eggs out of a nest and staring down
    a kommo-o while I was doing it.”
</p><p>
    There was a pause.
</p><p>
    “You were taking eggs out of a kommo-o’s nest?!”
</p><p>
    “Yup,” Raihan laughed, fueled by that little bit of panic that always came
    with facing an almost, not quite, not-fully kinda-feral brooding kommo-o.
    “And I didn’t even die!”
</p><p>
    “I thought half of your job existed because that’s <em>illegal</em> to do,”
    Leon said, somewhere between skeptical and accusatory.
</p><p>
    “In the wild, yeah, natural selection and all that,” Raihan replied,
    throwing the empty energy drink can away and then walking over to the mini
    fridge tucked in a corner to get another. “But you kinda have to, when
    you’re breeding them. I say this with all the love of my heart, Lee, but
    dragons are pretty freaking <em>stupid</em> when it comes to caring for
    their nests.” Leon choked on a laugh, and Raihan basked on the sound almost
    too long for comfort. “Seriously, step on their own eggs levels of stupid.
    Incubators were invented for a reason, y’know?”
</p><p>
    “Huh,” Leon said, and Raihan could just picture the look on his face, the
    little nose twitch he did when he figured out something new. “I guess I
    never really thought about what it meant for you to actually breed dragons
    like that.”
</p><p>
    “I mean, truth be told, yeah, we take care of the eggs and the hatchlings,
    but they’re dragons, Lee. Dragons are just gonna do whatever they want.”
    Raihan plopped back down on a bench and shrugged at his phone, even though
    he knew Leon couldn’t actually see him. “All I really do is get along well
    enough with the breeding group that they’ll let me in and take the eggs,
    when they’re done laying, and just… taking care about whatever comes out of
    those eggs.” He snorted. “Did I tell you about the year that I got eight
    salandits out of a clutch of nine eggs? I don’t even want to know how or
when or why that happened. ‘cause, you know.    <em>I like sleeping at night.</em>”
</p><p>
    “What did you even <em>do</em> with them?” Leon sounded morbidly
    fascinated.
</p><p>
    Raihan sighed.
</p><p>
    “Same thing I do for everything that ends up hatching under my roof?” He
    made an effort to sound vaguely offended, as if Leon doubting his good
    actions hurt him deeply. “Made sure they were healthy and then found them a
    good home. Honestly, what kind of monster do you take me for, Lee?”
</p><p>
    “The brooding kind,” Leon deadpanned, and then burst out laughing. “Get it?
    Cause like, brooding dragons? And, baby. Babies. You know.”
</p><p>
    Raihan buried his face in his hands.
</p><p>
    “I <em>will</em> hang up, Lee.”
</p><p>
    Leon laughed, because he knew as well as Raihan did, that he wouldn’t.
</p>
<hr/><p>
    “You look like shit,” Raihan said, when he opened the door and found Piers
    standing there, looking somewhere between manic and hungover.
</p><p>
    “You’re going to feed me,” Piers said, shoving past Raihan into the living
    room, and making a bee line for the couch. “And you’re going to get me
    enough beer I forget today even happened.”
</p><p>
    Given that today had been Darkest Day Remix: Electric Boogaloo, powered by
    the two pretenders to the throne and all the glorious, sticky complications
    that implied… yeah. Raihan wasn’t sure there was actually enough beer in
    the whole <em>world</em>.
</p><p>
    “She made you ride on the doom dragon, didn’t she,” Raihan said, not asked,
    and snickered as Piers raised a hand and telegraphed his feelings on the
    matter succinctly.
</p><p>
    “This is why I don’t do nice things for people,” Piers grumbled bitterly,
    “I’m retired, Raihan! I’m free! But sure, Milo comes in and asks for a no
    dynamax exhibition match, and like the sucker I am, I say yes. And there I
    was, at ground freaking zero.”
</p><p>
    “Don’t buy it, mate,” Raihan snorted, “Milo was there, and <em>he</em>
    didn’t jump at the chance of riding the doom dragon. Admit it, you just
    wanted to be the big damn hero.”
</p><p>
    “Pff, no,” Piers retorted, rolling his eyes. “I was making sure my sister’s
    girlfriend didn’t get herself killed somehow.” He paused. “Also, please
    stop talking about riding doom dragons, it sounds like you’re talking about
    your dick.”
</p><p>
    “My entire ass, Piers, eat it,” Raihan snarked back with a snarl, then
    immediately went to sit on the half of the couch that Piers’ short ass
    couldn’t cover. “Marnie and Gloria are dating?”
</p><p>
    “Eventually,” Piers sighed, folding his arms over his face. “I’m sure
    they’ll figure it out and feel just as silly as you and Leon will, once you
    stop dancing around the issue and just get a fucking room already.”
</p><p>
    “See, just for that we’re eating sushi, you jerk,” Raihan snapped, nostrils
    flaring as he ignored Piers’ weak attempts to kick his thigh. “Piers.”
</p><p>
    Piers peered at him from behind his hands, considering the shift in
    Raihan’s tone.
</p><p>
    “Mm?”
</p><p>
    Raihan reached out to poke an ankle.
</p><p>
    “Are you alright?”
</p><p>
    Piers actually took a moment to think about it.
</p><p>
    “I’ll… be.” He sighed. “I just need to not exist for a while.”
</p><p>
    “I can work with that,” Raihan replied, snickering.
</p><p>
    He didn’t actually order sushi, after all. Piers was gracious enough not to
    mention it.
</p>
<hr/><p>
    Their previous not-scheduled get together had been derailed by the whole
    dynamaxing disaster – the one not caused by the Champion’s spoiled pet of a
    legendary, anyway – so Leon had stayed in a hotel room when he’d come
    after, to help sort out the fallout from that. Raihan hadn’t said anything
    about it, and figured it was for the best considering Piers stayed in his
    guest room for three solid months after that, and only left to record the
    entire album he’d composed in Raihan’s garden.
</p><p>
    This time, Raihan’s house was entirely empty – cavernously so, sometimes,
    far too empty for his own thoughts to not echo if spoken out loud – but he
    knew better than to say anything, when he picked up Leon at his hotel the
    night before and took him to a new restaurant in the main street
    specializing on Kanto cuisine.
</p><p>
    It was fine.
</p><p>
    “Piers won’t fight me.”
</p><p>
    Raihan blinked at the weirdly petulant tilt to Leon’s voice.
</p><p>
    “I mean, it’s Piers, I think he’s got enough on his plate trying to fight
    his own hair, Lee,” he snarked, looking sideways down at the massive pout
    on Leon’s mouth.
</p><p>
    “He was in Wyndon for a concert,” Leon said, leaning on the railing,
    watching Gloria and Hop chat excitedly with Raihan’s Gym Trainers, showing
    off the supremely relaxed doom dragon of poison and hate that, despite all
    odds, really was a purrloin in spirit. “And I invited him out for lunch, to
    catch up and just… check on him. He seemed weirded out by that.”
</p><p>
    “See, that’s the problem,” Raihan replied, chuckling wryly. “You were nice
    to him. Piers assumes anyone who’s nice to him wants to screw him over. I
    bet you didn’t even call him names once.”
</p><p>
    “You’re joking,” Leon said, though he didn’t sound exactly sure of himself.
</p><p>
    “Half and half,” Raihan laughed, “don’t take it personally. He’s not
    exactly a social butterfly, y’know. And… let’s be honest, Lee, you’re kind
    of a lot.”
</p><p>
    Raihan regretted the playful jab immediately, given the kicked yamper look
    Leon gave him.
</p><p>
    “What’s that supposed to mean?” He asked, looking up at Raihan under the
    edge of his hat, seemingly turning small all of a sudden.
</p><p>
    “Hey, hey,” Raihan replied, raising his hands placatingly. “It means you’re
    social, Lee. Friendly! You like chatting up people and making friends.”
</p><p>
    “And that’s a bad thing?”
</p><p>
    “No!” Raihan shrugged. “No, it’s just… y’know. Not a Piers thing.” He
    tilted his head to the side. “Why do you want to fight him anyway? He’s
    retired and very obnoxiously loud about the fact.”
</p><p>
    Leon pursed his lips and looked away for a moment. Raihan wondered if he
    was upset, truly, and then Leon sighed and answered in a surprisingly soft
    tone.
</p><p>
    “He’s your… friend,” he said, almost childishly. And then he shrugged.
    “He’s Gloria’s friend too, kind of,” he added, in a louder, more confident
    tone. “I just… I just want to know he’s doing okay, I guess.”
</p><p>
    Raihan watched him for a moment, frowning, and then looked at his rotom
    phone, squinting at the time and doing the math in his head.
</p><p>
    “C’mon,” he said abruptly, reaching a hand to grab one of Leon’s wrists.
    “Let’s go.”
</p><p>
    “What?” Leon asked, but let himself be led a good three feet towards the
    nearest exit. “Rai, we’ve got a meeting in twenty minutes.”
</p><p>
    Technically, Leon had a meeting in twenty minutes, with the governing body
    of the power plant that still lived under Raihan’s Stadium. Raihan was
    keenly aware he was merely invited as a courtesy. He also knew it was just
    a waste of two hours, talking about how everything was exactly the same was
    it had been the quarter prior, only peppered with nicer graphics to make it
    look like they had improved somehow. It was inane.
</p><p>
    “So?” Raihan said, eyebrows arched. “I bet you’ve never missed a meeting in
    your life, huh.”
</p><p>
    “Of course not!” Leon flushed, tugging at his wrist but not really hard
    enough to escape Raihan’s grip. “That’d be… unprofessional,” he added,
    though the phrase sounded rehearsed, like something he’d been told over and
    over again and then became kind of thoughtlessly true in his head.
</p><p>
    “Screw that,” Raihan insisted, “c’mon, Chairman, you can be truant one day
    and the world won’t end.”
</p><p>
    For a moment there, Raihan almost pulled away and let go of Leon’s wrist.
    But then Leon smiled, that mischievous tilt of lips he used whenever he did
    something clever and Raihan was left reeling after one of his dragons got
    solidly taken out. He was then tempted to do something even more reckless
    and ridiculous like tilt his head and lean in and maybe kiss Leon for it.
    He didn’t. Obviously.
</p><p>
    But he did grin back, when Leon tugged his hat down to hide his face.
</p><p>
    “Alright, alright, but just today!”
</p><p>
    Raihan knew exactly what to do.
</p>
<hr/><p>
    Spikemuth was the kind of place Leon should never be allowed to roam in,
    unsupervised. The streets were narrow and twisty and there was a defiantly
    erratic hand in the layout, with diagonal and curved streets all over the
    place, as if someone had purposely chosen to design the city as a protest
    against the orderly grid that all other major settlements in Galar had been
    built in. Raihan would not be surprised to learn that was true, either.
    Then again, Spikemuth was the kind of place that had literally built domes
    over its streets to keep sunlight out, just to make a statement.
</p><p>
    Raihan chose not to tell Leon that he didn’t really know how to navigate
    the place from memory: most of the time he just followed the sound of
    Piers’ gigs and let the crowd lead the way.
</p><p>
    Spikemuth had been a sore sight, while Leon had still been Champion, even
    if they’d never admit it.
</p><p>
    There were crowds, now, like there had been way back, when Raihan had first
    visited the city as part of his first ever Gym Challenge. He knew Leon
    wouldn’t understand why that significant, but there was something
    profoundly comforting for Raihan, to see the neon lights shining bright and
    little clusters of people coming and going, loud and unrepentant and no
    longer pushed to the sidelines like they’d been before. The pink and black
    and spikey look was as ubiquitous as ever, and there was a sizable
    contingent of storefronts now cheerfully selling merch for Piers’ latest
    album and Marnie’s Gym Leader look, with equal fervor.
</p><p>
    Raihan told himself he was keeping an arm around Leon’s shoulders just to
    make sure he didn’t lose the wayward former Champion in the crowd. It had
    absolutely nothing to do with the fact Leon still fit really nicely under
    his arm, tucked against his side, or that he was enjoying that in anyway.
</p><p>
    Of course not.
</p><p>
    Eventually, they found themselves spilling out into the fence-ringed plaza
    that served both as Piers’ favorite concert venue and Marnie’s official
    stadium. In the stage at the back, Piers was busy rehearsing, voice finding
    a chorus in the excited sea of people who clustered close to the stage and
    happily jeered and sang back at him. Crucially, not all of them were
    members of Team Yell. It was well known Piers kept his practice schedule
    and saw no reason to keep the sessions private. He’d told Raihan someone
    had gotten the bright idea to try and charge a ticket to enter the plaza
    and Team Yell had cheerfully beaten the tar out of them until it became
    crystal clear that kind of thing was not allowed in Spikemuth. He didn’t
    mind if the people who came to listen to the rehearsals stuck around the
    town and had lunch or bought jewelry or any number of things now available
    on the streets again.
</p><p>
    They settled in the sidelines to watch Piers’ rehearsal, close enough to
    listen clearly, but not enough to get swept away by the mob-turned-mosh pit
    of fans screaming back at him along the chorus of each song.
</p><p>
    “This is a new low for you, Raihan,” Piers said, when he finished a set and
    left the stage to zero in on them in a way that let Raihan know the choice
    of songs in the last leg of that set had not been coincidence, either. “You
    take your boyfriend out on a date and you’re too cheap to even buy him
    tickets to an actual concert?”
</p><p>
    Leon made a choking noise in the back of his throat at the jab and
    immediately started to cough up a lung.
</p><p>
    “Eat my entire—you know the rest,” Raihan snarled on reflex, face flushed.
</p><p>
    “A-ha,” Piers purred back, smug and annoying as only he could be,
    simultaneously shoving a water bottle in Leon’s face without bothering to
    look at him. “You know how I feel about that.”
</p><p>
    “So does the entirety of Galar at this point,” Raihan said, shaking his
    head. “Also, my ‘boyfriend’,” he went on, making finger quotes in the air
    around the world, “wants to kick your teeth in.”
</p><p>
    “No, I don’t!” Leon squeaked, voice cracking somewhere between choked and
    flustered “I’m not—what I mean—<em>hi</em>.”
</p><p>
    He hung his head, pulling at his hat to hide his face.
</p><p>
    “Hi,” Piers drawled, one eyebrow arched. “Kick in my teeth, huh?”
</p><p>
    “No, no, no,” Leon insisted, waving his hands placatingly, “he’s joking! I
    think. I was just-“
</p><p>
    “Maybe <em>you</em> need your teeth kicked in?” Piers asked, leering
    slightly. “Because I-“
</p><p>
    “Keep forgetting you don’t call the shots here anymore,” Marnie
    interrupted, walking up behind Piers to wrap an arm around his waist and
    seamlessly tuck herself under his arm. “Team Yell is forbidden from
    starting random fights with people anymore.”
</p><p>
    “Tch,” Piers scoffed, rolling his eyes even as he tugged Marnie close to
    his side. “Going mad with power, huh.”
</p><p>
    Marnie shrugged and caught sight of Raihan’s grin. As always, she gave him
    a perfectly innocent look, the sort that always ended with Raihan giving
    her whatever she wanted and Piers bitching at him about spoiling his sister
    rotten.
</p><p>
    “Now, on the other hand, Spikemuth would be delighted to host an exhibition
    match,” she added, eyebrows arched and expression perfectly blank. “Good
    for PR, and all.”
</p><p>
    “That would be lovely!” Leon said, jumping at the chance because he was an
    idiot who didn’t know that you should never accept friendly battle offers
    from dark-type users unless you wanted your teeth to get <em>literally</em>
    kicked in. “I’d be delighted, Marnie, if-“
</p><p>
    “As will be Raihan, for sure,” Marnie went on, not bothering to look at
    him. “A single round of doubles should be good enough, right?” She smiled,
    just the tiniest sliver, which Raihan knew from experience was entirely too
    cute for how evil it usually was. “A former Gym leader and a former
    Champion, and their Gym Leader partners… it should be interesting, and
    you’re always talking about how not enough people see the importance of
    doubles, right, Raihan?”
</p><p>
    “About the same as Piers does about people using dynamaxing as a crutch,”
    Raihan agreed, resigned to his fate. “Winner pays for lunch, how about
    that?”
</p><p>
    Given the way Piers laughed, Raihan knew he understood his implicit
    resignation for the upcoming defeat.
</p><p>
    “Alright, you!” Piers yelled suddenly, turning to the crowd still lingering
    about, “out of the way! Gym business incoming!”
</p><p>
    In fifteen minutes flat, the plaza had emptied in such a way that the
    official stadium space was cleared out while the crowd had rearranged
    itself in the sidelines, and was quickly growing. An announcer appeared
    literally out of nowhere, and after a moment of consideration, Raihan let
    his rotom phone loose, and started live streaming the whole encounter.
</p><p>
    It wasn’t a fair fight, not by a long shot.
</p><p>
    He and Leon were not particularly well versed as double partners, and they
    had little chance to prepare or coordinate some kind of joint strategy to
    take down Piers and Marnie, who, Raihan knew, were really <em>good</em>
    doubles partners, considering that’s how Piers had taught Marnie the basics
    of pokemon battles when she was little. He’d also misread Marnie entirely,
    thinking his flygon would be a good enough counter to her morpeko at least
half the time, and instead found himself at the mercy of her grimmsnarl,    <em>all</em> the time. Leon had defied tradition and attempted to get the
    upper hand by being unpredictable and using rhyperior instead of charizard,
    probably expecting Piers to be thrown by the typing and get blindsided by
    megahorn. Except it hadn’t been enough to one-shot Piers’ obstagoon, which
    Raihan knew from experience was tankier and way more resilient than one
    would expect, and also knew counter, which <em>was</em> definitely enough
    to take out rhyperior in one shot after a single megahorn.
</p><p>
    Despite the loss, Raihan was reasonably certain his ulterior motive had
    been suitably fulfilled, as Leon went on the expected gushing tirade about
    it and Piers was put in the precarious position of receiving such earnest
    praise, while Marnie stoically navigated the streets and led them all to
    dinner. Which she paid for, and then politely excused herself from, when
    Piers started goading Leon to stay for a round of drinks or two, since he’d
    been a good sport about the whole thing.
</p><p>
    A drink with dessert stretched into drinks at Piers’ favorite karaoke bar
    in town, which of course ended up with Raihan witnessing Leon and Piers
slurring a very loud duet interpretation of Piers’ first single    <em>If Only You’d Tell Him</em> and trying not to die into his beer. It got
    to the point extreme measures had to be taken, like pulling up his hood and
    tugging at the strings until his face was hidden from the world, lest
    anyone saw how brightly he was blushing. It was one thing to know Piers was
    essentially building a music empire on the sad wasteland that was Raihan’s
    sex life. It was another entirely to have Leon be the one performing those
    songs, blissfully unaware of what they meant.
</p><p>
    “You’re an idiot,” Piers pointed out, following Raihan out of to the
    corviknight taxi spot outside the city gates, hands in the pockets of his
    pants and steps slightly uneven. “Just so you know.”
</p><p>
    “I know,” Raihan said, carrying Leon sprawled on his back, hands holding
    onto Leon’s knees, while Leon’s arms and his head were thrown bonelessly
    over Raihan’s shoulders, as he cheerfully hummed a tune under his breath,
    “trust me.”
</p><p>
    “The greatest idiot,” Piers insisted, holding open the door while Raihan
    shifted Leon about and got him sitting on the inside of the cab without
    banging his head on anything. “If you’d just literally just <em>tell</em>
    him, Raihan-“
</p><p>
    “Night, Piers!” Raihan said loudly, closing the door almost on Piers’ face.
</p><p>
    “Bye, Piers!” Leon said, launching himself forward and not falling face
    first into the floor because Raihan caught him in time. He shifted until he
    was halfway on Raihan’s lap, halfway pressed against the window. “I love
    your songs! Do you know? Because I do. <em>They’re so good.</em>”
</p><p>
    “I know,” Piers said, eyebrows arched in amusement. His eyes glinted at the
    prospect of Raihan’s suffering. “<em>And if you’d only tell him,</em>“ he
    began singing, infuriatingly smug.
</p><p>
“<em>How you feel!</em>” Leon chirped back, slightly offkey. “    <em>Maybe it wouldn’t be just in your head</em>”
</p><p>
    The ride back to Hammerlocke was a trial, if nothing else because now
    Raihan had to live with the knowledge of how well Leon fit in his lap,
    slurring out Piers’ passive aggressive bullshit into his chest.
</p><p>
    So there was that.
</p>
<hr/><p>
    Sometime after the double battle against Piers and Marnie – which had
    caused a scandal all over social media, Leon <em>losing</em> at anything
    pokemon related – and with the Gym Challenge season fast approaching,
    Raihan found himself falling into a routine, as Leon’s calls became more
    predictable, slotted into specific gaps in his schedule. It was nice.
    Torturous as always, sure, but nice.
</p><p>
    “I told him applins weren’t actually regulated, per se, it’s the orchards
    used to evolve them, but he insisted he felt weird just going out and
    getting one, like he was abusing a loophole or something,” Raihan sighed,
    sitting on a stool in front of the small counter in his kitchen where he
    ate pretty much always, because there was no point in eating in the dining
    room, if it was only him and three or four boxes or takeout. Besides, he
    had a nice view of the garden and his pokemon chilling about, so that was
    nice, too. “So I guess I’m breeding applins, now, because Milo is too much
    of a goody two shoes to go out his backyard and… y’know. Catch one.”
</p><p>
    “That sounds like Milo alright,” Leon chuckled, “he’s always been very…
    rules oriented. Makes working with him very easy, too.”
</p><p>
    “Speak for yourself, Chairman,” Raihan snorted. “I now have to go get an
    applin, raise it into a flapple or an appletun, introduce it to my breeding
    cluster, and then basically pray that one of my clutches will eventually
    hatch an applin to give him.” He sighed. “Because Milo doesn’t want to
    break a rule, that’s not even actually a rule.”
</p><p>
    Leon chuckled, across the line, and Raihan basked in the sound. It was
    worth getting dramatic about things, if only because it made Leon laugh to
    varying degrees, and with the stress mounting as he prepared to lead his
    very first Gym Challenge as Chairman of Macro Cosmo and Head of the League,
    his amusement became rarer and rarer by the day.
</p><p>
    “I mean, you could have said no,” Leon pointed out, “and you didn’t! That’s
    really nice of you, Rai.”
</p><p>
    “What can I say,” Raihan sighed, “I’m a sucker for lost causes, huh.”
</p><p>
    There was a moment of silence, as he heard Leon shuffle papers around his
    desk. Raihan reached out to grab the half empty can of soda that came with
    his dinner, and gave Leon time to sort out his thoughts. He got quiet,
    sometimes, while they were taking, right before he launched into a
    different topic. But it wasn’t like Raihan had anything more pressing to do
    – Leon’s new schedule to call him was very consciously not conflicting with
    Raihan’s Gym duties, including the part where he took eggs out of their
    nest while the parents watched, so that was a plus – and the conversations
    were, admittedly – and guiltily – the highlight of his days.
</p><p>
    “Am I a fuckup?” Raihan choked on his drink, spat it clear across the table
    and collapsed into a coughing fit. “Rai?” Leon’s voice asked, clearly
    alarmed, as Raihan’s rotom phone circled his head worriedly. “Are you
    okay?”
</p><p>
    “Yes!” Raihan rasped, clutching at his own throat. “Sorry, caught me off
    there, Lee.”
</p><p>
    “Oh,” Leon sounded strangely quiet, somewhat deflated. “I’m sorry, you
    don’t have to answer that.”
</p><p>
    “You’re not a fuckup, Lee,” Raihan insisted, leaning in to stare at his
    rotom as if Leon could see him.
</p><p>
    “I mean, I get lost in a straight corridor, Rai,” Leon replied, laughing,
    but there was a hollow ring to it. “And… I guess I didn’t realize how
    isolated from real life I was, spending so much time stuck in the whole
    Champion bubble, until it stopped, y’know? I’ve spent more time with my
    taxi driver than my actual brother. Or my family in general. And I knew
    there were going to be sacrifices, right? There’s a price to pay, to be the
    best. But-“
</p><p>
    “Lee,” Raihan said, frowning.
</p><p>
    “…it just never occurred to me I could just <em>stop</em>.”
</p><p>
    Raihan frowned at his phone, debated internally for a moment and then
    grabbed a napkin to rub all over his face and make sure it was clean before
    he poked the corner of rotom’s mouth and turned on video.
</p><p>
    “You’re not a fuckup, Lee,” Raihan said, staring down intently at his
    rotom. He waited and waited, but Leon never turned on video on his side, so
    he swallowed a shrug and offered a small smile. “Look, you took a really
    shitty situation with Rose and all his stupid nonsense, and you’ve been
    trying to make it better. You’ve been working hard on turning Macro Cosmos
    around and making sure it’s doing the best for Galar. When Rose got
    arrested, everything could have gone to shit, Leon, and you didn’t let it.
    You stepped up the plate and started to fix things.”
</p><p>
    “But I didn’t have a choice, Rai,” Leon replied, sounding very, very small.
    “You make it sound so noble and… I’m not.” He laughed, a little wet around
    the edges. “I never had a choice, you know? The moment I became Champion,
    Rose just… took over. It didn’t matter if I was tired or homesick or
    actually ill or anything. I was the Champion, and it was my responsibility
    to be the best, always. And I just took it for granted that’s how it was
    supposed to be. I got used to it. The hotel hopping, the skipping family
    days, the idea that I didn’t get off days. I didn’t really think about it,
    I just… grew into it.” He paused. “I’ve been trying really hard to not do
    to Gloria any of the things that Rose did to me that I hated, but she’s
    made me realize that even the things I didn’t hate where fucked up, too.
    And I am too much of a fuckup to realize it on my own.”
</p><p>
    “Lee-“
</p><p>
    “Gloria just told me she’s stepping down as Champion, at the end of the
    next Gym Challenge,” Leon whispered, “regardless of whether she wins or
    loses against a challenger.” He sniffled suspiciously. “And she was really
    nice about it, when she told me. That she hasn’t spent a solid week home
    since her own Gym Challenge started, and how she misses her mom and the
    fact she has two legendaries to look after, too.” Leon swallowed hard. “But
    she also said she didn’t want to be me, and… yeah, when I think about it, I
    don’t think I want to be me either. <em>Who would?</em>”
</p><p>
    “I think a lot of people want to be you,” Raihan said, after taking a deep
    breath and folding his arms on the counter, and offered a wry smile as he
    was keenly aware shutting off video would be a bad idea now. “They just
    don’t know what it means to be you. I didn’t know what it means to be you,
    and I like to think we’re close-“
</p><p>
    “Of course we’re close,” Leon interrupted, earnest as anything. “Rai,
    you’re my best friend in the whole world and the greatest rival anyone
    could ask for.”
</p><p>
    “Thanks, Lee,” Raihan chuckled. “But my point is, maybe you felt like you
    didn’t have a choice, when Rose got arrested and everyone just assumed,
    you’d take over, right? But you do have a choice. And you have a choice to
    not be whatever it is you are today that you don’t want to be. You can
    stop. You can do whatever makes you happy, you don’t owe anyone anything.”
    Raihan grinned. “And no, you’re not a fuckup. Even if you get lost in a
    straight corridor.” He winked. “It’s kidna cute, actually.”
</p><p>
    “Oh,” Leon said, voice oddly breathy, which Raihan took to mean he’d
    overstepped like an idiot, but before he could apologize, Leon continued.
    “Thank you, Rai. You’re the best.”
</p><p>
    “It’s what I do, Lee.” Raihan smiled. “Are you gonna be okay?”
</p><p>
    “I’ll try,” Leon sighed. “I’m sorry, Rai. For just… throwing all of that at
    you. I’m just-“
</p><p>
    “Hey, what I’m here for if not motivate you to be better, right?” Raihan
    laughed. “And hey, if it all fails, you still have keys to my place. Come
    hide in my guestroom until it all stops mattering, right?”
</p><p>
    “Right!”
</p><p>
    Raihan promised himself a beer once they hung up and Leon didn’t have to
    see him trying to claw his own eyes out at how stupid he was.
</p><p>
    It was fine.
</p>
<hr/><p>
    Apparently Raihan was the only person who’d gotten the heads up, about the
    Champion’s impending resignation. What he hadn’t gotten, though, was the
    heads up about Leon’s. Together, they made the week after the Championship
    Tournament into a nightmare of screaming speculation and dumb social media
    hot takes that were giving Raihan flashbacks to his first days as Gym
    Leader.
</p><p>
    Raihan figured the best thing he could do was wait for it all to die down,
    so he instead focused on other things. Important things. Like digging out a
    pond in the backyard and pretending that made sense at all, instead of
    being just an outlet for all the extra nervous energy that kept him pacing
    up and down the stairs every so often.
</p><p>
    “You could go down there,” Piers pointed out, sitting in the shade of a
    large umbrella, slurping his drink with a straw, because of course he’d
    come in to watch Raihan be stupid as soon as Raihan posted a selfie with a
    shovel, and made a production out of it. “Y’know. To Postwick. Check on him
    and see how he’s doing.”
</p><p>
    Piers just was that kind of an ass, of course.
</p><p>
    “He’s spending time with his family,” Raihan replied, giving Piers a
    suitably dirty look. “He doesn’t need me there making things weird like
    some kind of needy dumb stalker.”
</p><p>
    Piers snickered.
</p><p>
    “Oh so you’re trying the long-distance thing, then.”
</p><p>
    Raihan considered throwing a shovel-full of dirt at him, for his trouble.
</p><p>
    “Eat my ass, Piers,” he said instead, digging a bit more forcefully than
    strictly necessary. “He’s… got a lot to deal with right now, he doesn’t
    need my bullshit making everything weird.”
</p><p>
    “So you’re just going to stay here, dig out a pond for some reason, and
    make everything weird that way,” Piers summarized, clearly skeptical.
</p><p>
    “Maybe I just like landscaping!” Raihan snarled, knee-deep in a rather
    pitiful looking hole with dubious aspirations to become a pond. “Maybe this
    is a new hobby I wanna take up on. Why can’t you be supportive for once in
    your life, Piers?”
</p><p>
    Piers stared down his nose at him, and the fact he had a piña colada in one
    hand, frilly paper umbrella and all, did nothing to lessen the effect of
    that stare.
</p><p>
    Raihan swallowed hard and then let out a defeated sigh, head hanging low.
</p><p>
    “…his parents have a pond in their backyard, and he’s been talking nonstop
    about how much fun he’s been having with it—” Piers burst out cackling like
    a goddamn mightyena. “Shut up!”
</p><p>
    “I’m going to tell him, Raihan,” Piers said, once he stopped wheezing. “I
    swear I will. I will march up his front door, ring the doorbell and tell
    him to come here and fucking save me from how stupid you are.”
</p><p>
    “You <em>wouldn’t</em>,” Raihan hissed, bristling in a panic.
</p><p>
    Piers sighed so loudly, it seemed like his entire body slumped with the
    motion.
</p><p>
    “No, I wouldn’t,” he said, swirling his drink pensively. “Even though I
    really <em>should</em>.” He arched an eyebrow disdainfully. “Did you know I
    had to explain to him that we’re not dating?”
</p><p>
    Raihan missed his step, slipped and sprawled into the mound of dirt he’d
    piled at the edge of his would-be pond.
</p><p>
    “<em>What</em>.”
</p><p>
    Piers snorted.
</p><p>
    “I don’t know how you managed to fuck up so badly that he ended up thinking
    that,” he said, rolling his eyes with a flourish. “But I had to explain to
    him that we are not, in fact, <em>a thing</em>. I also had to explain to
    him that his brother is not dating his rival, on account of her dating my
    sister. Which they are, by the way. Dating, I mean. Officially and stuff.”
    He rolled his eyes, again. “So congratu-<em>fucking</em>-lations, Raihan.
    My sixteen-year-old sister managed to do in one year, what you haven’t been
    able to figure out in a goddamn decade. Color me impressed.”
</p><p>
    Raihan contemplated the wholly reasonable course of action, which was, of
    course, to jump into the hole he’d spent all morning digging, lie down on
    it, and politely ask Piers to bury him in place so no one had to deal with
    the abject failure that was his love life.
</p><p>
    Woe.
</p>
<hr/><p>
    A month after the end of the Gym Challenge, with summer just starting,
    Raihan opened the door one morning and found Leon standing awkwardly on the
    steps, one suitcase and a wary look on his face.
</p><p>
    “Hi, Rai,” Leon said, holding his hat in his hands and nervously scrunching
    it up as he stood in place, weight shifting from one foot to the other.
</p><p>
    “Hi, Lee,” Raihan replied, blinking in surprise, because he was fairly sure
    Leon had not actually knocked the door. “What are you doing here?” He
    asked, and as always, immediately regretted it, when Leon winced. “I mean,
    it’s good to see you, always. I just… wasn’t expecting to see you,” he
    finished, rather lamely.
</p><p>
    Leon laughed, an awkward rasp in the back of his throat, and offered a
    small shrug.
</p><p>
    “I mean, it took me a while to find my way here, but I’ve been multitasking
    and trying not to talk myself out of asking, so…” He licked his lips and
    looked up at Raihan rather hopefully. “I was… wondering if you’d mind, if I
    stayed here a while. I mean, I know you gave me the keys and told me I was
    welcome anytime, but… I don’t want to assume or anything. And it’s okay! If
    you mind, I mean. I know I’m… a lot, and you’re really busy with the Gym
    and the Vault and stuff. I just… I figured I’d ask.”
</p><p>
    “Sure,” Raihan said, which was mercifully a bit less embarrassing than the
    initial <em>please stay forever</em> that had almost crawled up his throat
    on reflex. He grinned at the tentative smile Leon gave him. “Lee, I gave
    you those keys for a reason, you’re always welcome here. However long you
    need, it’s fine.”
</p><p>
    The hug caught him by surprise. Raihan swayed slightly as Leon attached
    himself to him, arms wrapped up tight around his back and face buried into
    his chest. It took him a second, hands hovering awkwardly, before he
    swallowed hard and wrapped is arms around Leon, returning the hold.
</p><p>
    Alas, it couldn’t just stretch wonderfully into forever, and the moment was
    eventually ruined by Raihan’s stomach rumbling rather loudly, considering
    he’d been on his way to hunt down breakfast.
</p><p>
    “I was going to say I’d pay rent,” Leon said, laughing as he stepped back,
    blinking up at Raihan with a grin. “But I can also pay you in food.”
</p><p>
    “Oh no,” Raihan gasped, mock-shocked, “it’s super effective!”
</p><p>
    Leon beamed, that same bright smile of his that Raihan swore could
    illuminate the entirety of Galar for a year, if only someone tried to
    harness its power.
</p><p>
    “It’s a deal then,” he said, and Raihan didn’t lean in and kiss him right
    there and there because he was a goddamn fucking idiot.
</p><p>
    “It’s a deal, Lee.”
</p><p>
    Piers was never going to let him hear the end of it.
</p>
<hr/><p>
    Living with Leon was an unmitigated nightmare.
</p><p>
    He woke up ungodly early every morning, and there was always coffee and
    breakfast waiting for Raihan downstairs, whenever he crawled out of bed. He
    went on errands every other morning, until he got too lost to find his way
    home, and then he often texted or called Raihan to come fish him out of
    whatever obscure corner of Hammerlocke he’d ended up stuck in. He dutifully
    took over babysitting duty whenever Raihan had baby dragons to look after,
    or otherwise spoiled his and Raihan’s pokemon rotten without a second
    thought. And yes, he enjoyed sitting at the edge of the pond that Raihan
    had eventually finished setting up, and kicked his bare feet on the water,
    whenever it got too hot to wear pants. Every inch of Raihan’s house had a
    thin patina of Leon on it, either his books or the smell of his cologne or
    the aroma of whatever he was cooking now or the sound of his voice echoing
    from the garden.
</p><p>
    Raihan wanted to die, it was great.
</p><p>
    When the time came for his yearly camping trip with Piers, Leon had
    promised to not burn the house down and assured him he had everything under
    control. Raihan believed him enough to leave two angry jangmo-os and a
    nibble-happy axew under his care. It wasn’t, he told himself, that big of a
    deal. Leon was a dragon trainer himself and he’d raised baby dragons
    before. And he seemingly loved baby dragons, apparently. It would be fine.
</p><p>
    It was fine.
</p><p>
    “I have two terabytes of video, of him playing with baby dragon pokemon,
    Piers,” Raihan said, lying next to him as they stared at the stars in the
    sky. “Just… end me, now. End my suffering.”
</p><p>
    “Instructions unclear,” Piers snorted, arms folded behind his head, “do I
    kill you or do I call him and tell him how you feel?”
</p><p>
    “I think I’m going to do it,” Raihan whispered, and then swallowed hard. “I
    think I’m actually gonna do it this time. I just… he <em>sings</em> your
    awful fucking songs while he does chores around the house and he wears his
    hair up in a messy bun when he’s doing dishes and he just cooks, every day,
    and I just can’t, okay? I thought I could, but I can’t. I gotta tell him,
    I’m going to die otherwise.”
</p><p>
    “I mean, I’ve just been telling you to do that for years now,” Piers
    snorted unkindly, “you’ll excuse me if I don’t exactly believe you until
    you actually do it.”
</p><p>
    “I’m gonna do it,” Raihan insisted, “I have to.”
</p><p>
    If all he had to contend with was Piers’ skepticism, he would have been
    fine.
</p><p>
    But then the hydreigon attacked.
</p><p>
    It wasn’t the worst camping trip in history, of course – that privilege
    still was reserved for the year Piers accidentally pissed off the entire
    noivern population in the Lake of Outrage and their trip had been cut short
    by a rather frantic retreat to avoid getting torn to pieces. This wasn’t
    that… of course not, but it was one hell of a start for their week.
</p><p>
    Particularly when Piers’ reaction was a choked <em>oh shit</em> and an
    instinctive pokeball throw.
</p><p>
    “Did you just-“ Raihan spluttered, as they watched the little ball wobble
    in place.
</p><p>
    “It’s a third stage dragon at full health, Raihan,” Piers snapped, “of
    course I’m not going to catch it, it’s just a distraction…” Of course, he
    trailed off as the ball finally stopped and the light indicator went off,
    signaling a successful catch. “Aw, fuck.”
</p><p>
    “You can’t just catch wild dragons, Piers!” Raihan snapped, reaching out to
    grab him and shake him in place. “That’s illegal, you idiot!”
</p><p>
    “I’m not going to keep it!” Piers snapped back, feet dangling in the air.
    “I’ll just release it, okay?”
</p><p>
    “Good fucking luck with that,” Raihan snarled, and then let him drop back
    to the ground. “Why do you think we screen potential trainers so hard? You
    can’t release dragons once you catch them, they just refuse to go.”
</p><p>
    “…huh,” Piers said, reaching down to grab the pokeball, “that actually
    makes a lot of sense.”
</p><p>
    “I know right?” Raihan muttered sarcastically, “I do things for a reason,
    who knew!”
</p><p>
    “Get off that high mudsdale, Raihan,” Piers snorted, “we were just
    discussing how bad you are at doing what you’re supposed to do.”
</p><p>
    Raihan supposed – internally, to himself only – that Piers’ accidental
    capture was a blessing in disguise. Sure, he was going to have to lie on
    official records to hide the fact they’d done the one thing no one was
    allowed to do in the Lake of Outrage, and the rest of the trip devolved
    into a crash course on dragon rearing to help Piers wear down the worst of
    his new hydreigon. But at least that meant Raihan didn’t have much time to
    think about Leon, back home, and Piers certainly didn’t have time to
    compose a new song or berate him endlessly about the disaster that was his
    love life.
</p><p>
    Silver linings and all that.
</p>
<hr/><p>
    The house was not on fire, when he got home. All baby pokemon were happy
    and well looked-after. Leon still woke up before six in the morning and
    hummed Piers’ latest single as he slid down the handrail on the stairs.
    Still, Raihan had a plan. A good one! He had reservations to a really good
    restaurant up in Wyndon, Henri was providing the clothes for the occasion
    and Milo had hooked him up with the best florist in Turffield as a
    preemptive thank you for that applin Raihan was still trying to breed for
    him. He only got one shot at it, so it had to be perfect, every detail
    calculated and accounted for.
</p><p>
    Just a few days more, and then… it would be time to face the music.
</p><p>
    But in the meantime, he told himself there was nothing creepy in basking in
    the sight of Leon, messy bun and everything, cooking breakfast in the
    morning. The man baked muffins, for fuck’s sake. Raihan was only human.
</p><p>
    “I’m in love with you.”
</p><p>
    Raihan inhaled his muffin, poured boiling coffee down his pants with his
    flailing and then unceremoniously fell off the stool.
</p><p>
    “Rai!” Leon dove in to help him upright and also possibly get him to stop
    coughing up a lung. “I’m so sorry, I was just-“
</p><p>
    “<em>What</em>.”
</p><p>
    Leon flushed and fiddled with a spatula.
</p><p>
    “Look, I’ve been thinking about it for a long while, and, it’s really
    dishonest of me to not tell you how I feel,” he said, licking his lips and
    studiously not looking at Raihan in the eye. “It’s okay if you don’t feel
    that way, please don’t think you have to… humor me or my feelings. It’s
    just… you’re my best friend and my greatest rival and I really do love you.
    It’s… cowardly of me, to pretend I don’t and… I understand if you don’t
    feel that way. I just… I need you to know. That’s all.”
</p><p>
    “Lee-“
</p><p>
    “It’s okay if you don’t feel that way,” Leon insisted, hands clutching onto
    that spatula like a shield that would protect him from the world. “I can
    deal with my feelings on my own, and if… hell, if you think I should move
    out, I will. I just… Mum said honesty was the best policy, but I was just
    procrastinating on it, and then I realized I was being cowardly about it.
    So!” He offered a very shaky smile. “Yeah. I love you.”
</p><p>
    Leon swallowed hard when Raihan reached out to hold his face in his hands.
    There was a moment of hesitation, a slight pause as Raihan gathered aplomb,
    and then he leaned in and kissed him, just a brush of lips. The spatula
    clattered loudly on the floor, between them.
</p><p>
    “Yeah?” Raihan asked, pulling back enough to watch Leon’s face get warmer
    and warmer by the second. “Lee?”
</p><p>
    Leon swallowed hard.
</p><p>
    “Yeah.”
</p><p>
    The next kiss was nowhere near as tentative, for sure.
</p><p>
    Later, much later, closer to noon than morning, Raihan laid as long as he
    was on his bed, one hand absently playing with the tips of Leon’s hair, as
    Leon melted comfortably against his chest, basking in the moment.
</p><p>
    “You asked your mum on advice for this,” Raihan pointed out, more amused
    than anything. Leon flushed and curled up slightly, burying his face into
    Raihan’s chest. “Lee.”
</p><p>
    “Look, I was under a lot of stress, fighting off an identity crisis and
    probably having something of a meltdown,” he whined, sneaking his arms
    around Raihan to cling properly. “I had a bit of a cry in the kitchen, so
    Mum made me tea and told me to move in with you.”
</p><p>
    “Seriously?” Raihan asked, nudging Leon up slightly so he would face him.
</p><p>
    Leon shrugged and refused to look at him in the eye.
</p><p>
    “She said living with you would let me know if it was just a crush or
    something else,” he admitted, licking his lips, which were still sporting
    the imprint of Raihan’s teeth on them. “And it did, so there!” He swallowed
    hard. “I want us to work out, Rai.”
</p><p>
    “I mean, how couldn’t we, Lee,” Raihan teased, leaning in to press his lips
    to the corner of Leon’s jaw. “We’re the best at everything. It’s our
    thing.”
</p><p>
    The way Leon smiled, Raihan actually believed it.
</p>
<hr/><p>
    Leon’s new pet project, a post Gym Challenge League of sorts, to formally
    phase out the figure of a Champion for the region, was the kind of
    ambitious thing only Leon could, not only come up with, but deliver on.
    After months of fretting about it and bouncing ideas off Raihan – among
    other things, ahem – the great day had come. Leon fussed about his clothes
    until Raihan pulled him up for a kiss and refused to let go until Leon’s
    knees were buckling slightly. Then he turned him around and shoved him out
    into the spotlights with a smirk, and made sure to leer appropriately every
    single time Leon caught his eye in the crowd.
</p><p>
    Gloria and Hop served as the central act, with a six on six exhibition
    match that ended with Hop pulling a win after his dubwool was the last one
    standing, albeit barely. The audience was almost as excited about that, as
    they were about the whole new album Piers premiered in the opening
    ceremony.
</p><p>
    After the concert, there were battles held in each floor of the newly
    christened Battle Tower, with Leon running up and down the entire building,
    keeping an eye on things. Raihan kept to the sidelines, offering the
    occasional hug, water bottle or chance to sit and recharge for a few
    minutes, but otherwise let Leon take center stage. It was a resounding
    success, any way one cared to look at it. Participants were pumped from all
    the different battles, the audience was enthralled, and Leon was beaming
    like a miniature sun liable to blind any who looked at him without proper
    eye protection.
</p><p>
    “Had enough warmup for today?” Raihan asked, long after everyone had left,
    and he found Leon standing in the uppermost floor, staring up at the
    sky. “Up for one last round with your rival?”
</p><p>
    “Single or doubles?” Leon asked, looking at Raihan over his shoulder,
    confident but serene.
</p><p>
    “Oho, cocky,” Raihan taunted, walking up to the center of the field with
    his hands in his pockets, “you’re gonna teach me doubles now?”
</p><p>
    “Show you what I’ve learned, more like,” Leon shot back, ultraball already
    at hand. “I heard the Hammerlocke Gym Leader is pretty ruthless when it
    comes to doubles!”
</p><p>
    Raihan grinned, fangs in full display.
</p><p>
    “I heard he’s looking for a partner,” he said, pulling a ball from his
    belt, “won’t settle for anything less than the best.”
</p><p>
    Leon’s eyes gleamed as he released his pokemon with due flair.
</p><p>
    “I guess he can stop looking now.”
</p><p>
    Raihan laughed, well aware the actual result of the battle was pretty
    meaningless at that point.
</p><p>
    “I guess he can!”
</p><p>
    But that didn’t mean he wasn’t going to give it his all, every time, all
    the time.
</p><p>
    You could say it was his thing.
