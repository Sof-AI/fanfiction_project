    <p>It wasn’t often that Piers’s and Leon’s heat synced up.</p><p>Even with his newest position at the Battle Tower, Leon suppressed his cycle aggressively, stamping down anything even remotely Omegan about his nature. He may as well be an Alpha to the public eye. Overlooked was the fact he belonged to the stereotypically softer caste; how could he be, when he had been the shining example of everything an Alpha was?</p><p>That stigma had stuck with him like glue as he dry swallowed pills to keep his nature under wraps, always keeping a spare bottle in Raihan’s cupboard like an addict. <em>Just in case</em>.</p><p>Piers was a different enigma entirely.</p><p>While Leon suppressed himself excessively, Piers hardly did at all, letting his scent flaunt and nature beam proudly upon his chest. Most polite company would ask that at least a scent blocker be applied- but Piers felt little need to mask himself. “<em>Why the bloody ‘ell should I? Alphas flaunt their scent around like a wafty perfume. Can’t I exist without droppin’ a dime on some nasty neutral smell spray</em>?”</p><p>Two polar opposites, two sides of the spectrum, and Raihan had been lucky enough to bag both of ‘em.</p><p>In truth it was because Leon and Piers were both occasional flings on the side for the longest time, but who knew they’d be so cheeky together? Half the time they bantered together and nested without even needing Raihan for a loose t-shirt. That suited the dragon tamer just fine. He was content to be invited within their nest now and then for a romp.</p><p>Which, in truth, made it all the more jarring to receive a text from <em>both</em> of his mates at once.</p><p>Piers’s text was short and sweet, reading little more than, ‘<strong>Get your arse over to Wyndon.’</strong></p><p>It took Leon’s elaboration to make something possessive flare within his chest. This was certainly an abnormality. ‘<strong>We’ve synced up. It’s becoming hard to bear, so please, come to the penthouse with provisions.’</strong></p><p>Raihan had thrown himself out of bed not a single moment later. He was only called upon if it really was a pressing manner, which made this all the more serious. Camilla perked up in open curiosity as he stumbled his way out of his Hammerlocke office space, pulling on his shoes two at a time, hoodie thrown casually over his shoulder as he gathered up the spare articles of clothing that weren’t in desperate need of a wash.</p><p>“Is everything okay, sir?” Sebastian spoke up, his tone even, even as Raihan swore beneath his breath and almost dropped all his laundry on the cement. He sighed deep. “Can you grab me a bag? I’m going to be indisposed for at least a week, and trust you all to look over the place.”</p><p>His three personally trained associates perked up and nodded, offering a quick salute to Raihan. It was Aria who hurried off to fetch him a carry tote, the buzzing of Raihan’s phone setting him even further on edge. He whistled to his Rotom to hover before his face.</p><p>
  <strong>Leon: <em>Rai, please. We need you here. It hurts so badly and our fingers aren’t enough.</em></strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Piers: <em>you best be on your way, wanker. i’m not waiting much longer.</em></strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Leon: <em>I’m so empty, Alpha. You need to hurry. I need your knot to fill me.</em></strong>
</p><p>
  <strong>Piers: <em>m’so wet right now, could use your face to sit on. come stuff me full before i find another sorry chap to.</em></strong>
</p><p>Fuck.</p><p>Raihan was bordering on feral as he accepted the bag from Aria, stuffing the clothing inside, before throwing it over his shoulder and darting through the vault. “Keep the place running! Don’t burn it down and all that!” he offered as a goodbye, already almost out of sight as Flygon’s ball came off his belt. He tossed it and hopped upon her back as she stretched her wings for takeoff- somehow sensing her master’s unease.</p><p>They made it there in record timing. She’d always been his fastest flier, and he thanked her profusely as they dropped off at the entrance of Leon’s complex, recently purchased to accommodate his new position as Chairman. It was a sprawling and impressive high-rise building that was tucked cozily away near the back of Wyndon. Plenty of privacy, and even more space for Leon’s Pokémon to roam freely.</p><p>Raihan didn’t even have to knock as he slid his key into the door, hearing it click, before tugging it open.</p><p>He almost bucked at the intense rush of pheromones that greeted his nose.</p><p>Leon’s scent was deep and floral, carrying with it hints to his older life in the countryside. It had been so long since Raihan had managed to catch a whiff of it. It sung deep to his instincts that <em>this</em> was how his mate should smell, sweetened and needy, drunk off of lust and affection. He licked his lips as he shut the door behind himself, locking it tight.</p><p>Piers’s natural scent may be flaunted commonly, but there was no denying that spice and smoke suited him. It was a strange smell for an Omega to carry. In a sense it was just as loud and abrasive as Piers’s stage performances, mixing into his more subdued personal life. It was so wholly Piers that it made Raihan’s heart beat in affection.</p><p>He licked his lips as he began to climb the stairs, chasing the smell of his mates with an eager pace. It didn’t take long until he heard them.</p><p>Piers sang just as sweet as he did on stage when he was being pleasured, his cries and calls filling the empty space of Leon’s penthouse. Every desperate cry was met with an equally needy croon from his nesting partner. Raihan buckled down tenfold as he rushed his way through the hall towards the master suite, the glans at the base of his neck swelling and aching. He was being driven wild by the smell of <em>both</em> his partners.</p><p>He saw that the door was cracked, the only light peeking in coming from the half-drawn curtains. It made Raihan’s gut twist in sheer <em>need</em> as he caught a glimpse inside.</p><p>Piers had spread himself out like a dream within the large nest they’d both constructed, hair framed back, unrestrained without the ponytail to hold it back. He mewled and whimpered as his hands reached up to grab ahold of some blankets, squeezing them tight, all while those thin and pale thighs clamped down tight around Leon’s head.</p><p>The former champion was busying himself with licking into his packmate’s cunt, taking the edge off that they both must feel. He was still somehow half-dressed in his red button down and frilly necklace, as rumpled and astray it had become. The one thing he was missing were those riding pants- all so he could bury two fingers inside his own needy hole, scissoring them in and out.</p><p>Raihan felt all the blood rush down to his cock as he watched the debauched sight.</p><p>He must have been exuding his own pheromones, since drowsily Piers perked up, turning his head to the door and willing his expression to turn smug when he saw the Alpha standing there. Slowly he worked his fingers through Leon’s hair. “A-Ah, Leo. I think we <em>finally</em> have a fuckin’ guest.”</p><p>The eager noise that left him made Raihan’s chest feel warm with affection, Leon pulling himself off of Piers’s clit, his chin wet with slick and arousal. He smiled bright despite it.</p><p>“Rai! Oh, bloody hell, it’s about time. We’ve been so desperate, I…” Leon swallowed, pupils heavily dilating as he took in a deep breath of Raihan’s natural musk. He was as upforth as his sandstorms; earthy, deep, and <em>strong</em>. Leon wiped his chin off on the nest, adding to how pheromone saturated it already was. “I thought you’d never get here.”</p><p>Piers stretched out lazily, only his black tank top protecting any modesty he had. He brought his hand down to rub over his clit. “We missed you, dragon boy. <em>Come inside</em> already.” He teased, Raihan feeling fired up by that loose tongue of his. Piers always kept him on his toes as he spread his folds in invitation.</p><p>“I came as fast as I could.” Raihan rumbled out, tossing the bag towards his mates, watching as eagerly Leon bent over to ruffle inside of it. He bunched the fabric of Raihan’s scented laundry and brought it to his nose for inspection, shuddering at the pheromones, before bringing it to Piers for his approval as well. They’d only add it to the nest if they were <em>both</em> happy with it.</p><p>Piers crooned as he snatched it up, turning over, making a show of raising his pert ass as he started to line the nest with Raihan’s scent. “Ah, I knew you’d come through with the goods. We<em> needed</em> our <em>Alpha</em>.” He spoke with his tongue as sweet as honey, stroking Raihan’s confidence.</p><p>Leon whined as he beckoned Raihan closer.</p><p>“Get in, please. We need you.” Leon whispered, his features so gorgeously flushed, heat making his head fuzzy and movements slow. It had to be bad- what with how long the former Champ had suppressed himself. “I can’t wait any longer.”</p><p>While there was still some semblance of sanity left within the dragon’s mind, he stripped off his hoodie, tossing it towards the nest as well. He made a quick detour to where their little box of goodies were kept, kneeling down, tugging the box out from beneath Leon’s nightstand. He could hear the whining and whimpering coming from the nest as he unclasped the hinges.</p><p>“I know, babes, I gotta get something first.” He spoke, rummaging through the box with his brows pinched. As much as he hates this thing...he knew he couldn’t control himself around two fertile Omegas. He brought the muzzle to his jaw before cringing as he clasped it over his mouth. It was a leather piece that ensured that no matter how desperate he became, he couldn’t bite, making sure that he could never actually create a mating bond.</p><p>Or, y’know, really fuck up their shoulders. His teeth were abnormally sharp even for an Alpha.</p><p>He felt like a caged beast as he stripped off his pants next, the tent of his arousal standing proud for them to see. He adjusted himself with a heavy hand. “I think m’ready to go.” He said with the corner of his lips quirked in amusement.</p><p>Leon and Piers scrambled to make room in the nest, with Leon’s expression bordering on desperate.</p><p>“As loathe as I am to say it; I think Leon needs it first more than I do.” Piers lazily drawled while Raihan climbed into the nest, bumping his cheek affectionately to the smaller man. His heady scent rubbed off from the motion, leaving Piers happily purring at the scent mark left behind. He shuffled back to let Leon clamber onto Raihan’s lap.</p><p>Even between their scents, it was like Leon was keyed up to ten, his scent glands overproducing from never having a synced heat cycle before. It was horribly overpowering as he pawed at Raihan’s chest.</p><p>“Puh...Please, Rai. I can’t.” The former Champ whined, gasping between his teeth when Raihan reached down to squeeze the globes of his ass. His slit dripped embarrassingly fast onto the other gym leader’s pants. “Need your cock. M’burning up, and feel so <em>empty</em>.” Leon confessed, his fingertips twitching, antsy while he felt the smooth muscles rolling down Raihan’s chest.</p><p>Piers’s lip quirked in amusement as he shifted behind Leon, pressing him between their bodies. “Suppressants do that to you, aye? S’why I keep telling ya to come off ‘em!” He teased, placing slow kisses along Leon’s neck and jaw, nipping at the start of his signature beard. Raihan nodded in agreement as he leant back enough to palm over his clothed cock, reaching inside to fish it out.</p><p>Leon groaned in appreciation at the thick shaft that pressed to his lower stomach. “I…can’t. I need the suppressants to keep my mind. I cannot simply quit them, nor would I care to after so long of using them.” He grit out, all while humping forward, trying to chase the friction he needed so bad.</p><p>The smell of his Alpha and the heady notes of his pre made Leon’s mouth positively <em>water</em>.</p><p>Piers snuffed behind his shoulder, hands coming up to grope over Leon’s chest, undoing the buttons to his restrictive top. He used his other hand to outright grab Raihan’s cock and guide it towards Leon’s leaking slit. “Then you’ll keep getting’ surprise heats like this and slick all over your boyfriends.” Fuck. That was kind of hot.</p><p>Raihan watched with hooded eyes as his cock was placed against those warm and slickened folds, smearing their bodies together as he shared a heated glance with Piers over Leon’s shoulder. He wanted to kiss that pretty smirk off his face…but alas, the muzzle would do its job in the end. So he stuck his tongue out and held Leon steady while the Omega desperately tried pushed down onto his shaft.</p><p>“I, can’t…It shouldn’t have even happened! I did everything right!” Leon whined, though his voice pitched high, grinding down enough to let the head of Raihan’s cock pop inside of his wet pussy.</p><p>It was enough to soak his shaft entirely with a single roll of their bodies, only the tip hovering inside as Leon’s thighs tensed and quaked. Did he-? Raihan’s eyes fluttered as his teeth grit hard, the warm contractions of his rival’s cunt milking him, proving that he’d actually came the very moment he <em>put it in</em>. Piers whistled in appreciation himself as he pulled his soaked digits back, admiring how Leon’s slick had splashed him too.</p><p>His head was thrown back in pleasure as his wild mane of purple cascaded off his shoulders, revealing the Omega’s smooth throat. Raihan felt absolutely wild as he leant forward without thinking.</p><p>The bump of his muzzle prevented him from making contact with his neck, teeth snapping with a low snarl as he just <em>couldn’t</em> reach. The sight and smells around him were driving him crazy as he used his broad hands to wrap around almost the entirety of Leon’s waist. “Ooh, fuck, does our big Alpha want a taste?”</p><p>It was Piers’s voice that caught his attention next, feeling his cock twitch as Leon shakily dropped himself down, swallowing the length entirely.</p><p>He had fingers shoved into his face as Piers pushed past the bars of the muzzle, his fingers coaxed in a mixture of his own and Leon’s slick. Raihan felt a bit of drool escape him as he pushed his tongue out. “<em>Fuck yeah,</em>” He growled in excitement, hands tightening on Leon, before dragging the former champion further onto his cock and rocking inside of him at the same time.</p><p>Piers’s cheeky grin really should be far more infuriating than it was, but Raihan felt little more than contentment as he licked over his fingers, curling his skilled tongue around them as he chased every drop of slick that he could reach. His boyfriends were like a feast to his senses as he licked his lips, savoring them to their fullest.</p><p>Leon moaned loud and long as he rolled his hips onto Raihan’s cock, shuddering at the tight fit. The Alpha was <em>huge</em> inside of him. He filled Leon up just right while he steadied his shaking thighs, beginning to rise up and down along his massive cock, gasping at how crazy it drove his boyfriend. He whimpered softly as he fell back down onto his cock, shuddering as it bumped his clit to Raihan’s mound. “Rai…”</p><p>He hardly had the strength to move himself, so lost was he to pleasure. Piers didn’t make the task any easier as he reached around to nuzzle against his boyfriend and packmate, kissing the sides of his neck, knowing full well Raihan couldn’t.</p><p>They both loved the desperate growl it pulled from their dragon.</p><p>“Leo, you’re takin’ his cock <em>so well</em>.” Piers’s purred, humping himself shamelessly against Leon’s back. While Leon was a hot mess while lost to heat, Piers’s confidence only grew, melting into his stage persona rather than the shy and snarky punk that Raihan was used to. He had one goal only when he was in heat; and it was to get <strong>fucked</strong>.</p><p>His saliva coated fingers went back down to Leon’s slit, rubbing over the sensitive nerves atop it with harsh pressure. The noise it dragged from his throat was <em>sinful</em>.</p><p>Raihan groaned low as he dragged Leon down once more, rutting into his cunt, feeling the warm way it clenched around him from the sudden pleasure. He could feel the spongy walls of his cervix knocking against his cockhead with every thrust, feeling how Leon’s nails came down to grip his shoulders.</p><p>“Raihan, Piers-!” Leon called out, his head leaning back to rest against Piers’s shoulder, mouth parted open and tongue lolled out as he felt their tempo increase. It was hard to keep his head straight as he ground back with as much gusto as his body could muster. “More! Fuck, I need more! Need to feel you so deep inside me I can’t be empty again!”</p><p>The words spewing out from Leon’s mouth were positively fucking filthy. Raihan stared with dangerous eyes as Piers nestled into him and planted open mouthed kisses along his neck and jaw, leading up to his mouth.</p><p>The poor dragon tamer shuddered as their mouths met in a messy tangle of tongue and teeth, Leon gasping and panting into Piers’s mouth, reaching back with one arm to wind around the smaller Omega. Raihan licked his dry and bitten-raw lips. The muzzle was a taunting pressure around Raihan’s face, restricting him from doing little more than moaning. He grit his teeth as Piers flashed him a smug look, using his fingers to spread Leon wide open, showing off the rosy pink of his cunt.</p><p>“You gonna fill this hole for him, Rai? Our big, strong Dragon?” he panted, tongue darting out to slide with Leon’s. He pulled back to rub over his clit. “Gonna breed him good?”</p><p>Both Leon and Raihan moaned at that, the tight clench of their bodies making their pace stutter. Piers had struck home. He smiled from ear to ear as he leant back, bringing Leon down with him, until he was able to hike one of Leon’s legs beneath his arm. Piers knew that their former Champ was flexible enough to hold it as grabbed Raihan’s muzzle with his fingers.</p><p>He laughed as their Alpha had to crane down and follow Piers’s sharp tug, hovering over both Leon and him now. “Good boy.  I want a turn, too, so fuck him nice and good.” The punk all but demanded, watching the moment that the new position clicked for Raihan. He could <em>really</em> work into Leon now. He braced himself against the nest as he snapped and growled behind the muzzle, seeing Piers’s fingers so close to the grating.</p><p>It made him burn all the hotter as Leon moaned imploring up at him, both of his legs wrapping firm around Raihan’s waist. They dug into the small of his back while his hands came up to claw over his rival’s shoulder once more. “Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck-!” he chanted, pussy clamping down right around Raihan’s swelling knot. He wasn’t going to last much longer than this.</p><p>Piers’s heavy breathing was echoing against the side of his ear, betraying how affected he was too. The pheromones in the air were getting to be thick and cloying, choking the group, until all that plagued their mind was the need for release.</p><p>“Oh, Rai, I’m going to cum again!” Leon moaned out in one long breath, his thighs clenching tight around his waist. There would be marks lasting upon his shoulder from the pressure of their former Champion’s nails.</p><p>It made his teeth bear in a low snarl as he shoved his face fruitlessly against the side of Leon’s neck, snapping his teeth, a mixture of spittle and drool following his efforts as he tried to chase the sweet pheromones rushing out from his lover. The cage merely smashed against his jaw and cheeks as he tried to bite.</p><p>He snapped his hips forward as he bore down ontop of Leon, a frustrated shout leaving him, all while his knot swelled inside and stole both of their breaths away. He shuddered as their bodies tied together. Leon threw his head back and screamed in relief as his walls were made to stretch around Raihan’s knot, squirming down onto it, his very toes curling as he felt wonderfully and deliciously <em>full</em>.</p><p>He came just like that, with Raihan’s knot filling his pussy, throbbing deep inside of him.</p><p>Leon shook from head to toe as his back arched into the pressure, desperately scrambling for purchase. He could feel all of Raihan’s warm seed flowing inside of him, painting his insides, bringing relief to his heat-struck body. The sensation of being knotted was enough to scratch that temporary itch in his mind, making him slump back with a satisfied coo as he realized Piers was still behind him.</p><p>The purple haired man nuzzled affectionately against Piers’s chest, feeling those thin arms wind around his shoulders and purr right on back at him.</p><p>“Y’did so good, holy hell, that was hot as fuck.” Piers praised with a dopey smile, his eyes hooded…though he struggled to stay still as he ground and humped against Leon’s back with small movements. It reminded them both that while Leon may be temporarily sated, Piers still was experiencing his heat cramps, holding Leon tight and trying not to ruin their afterglow with his needy pawing.</p><p>But inevitably Raihan’s hooded gaze flicked back up, his mouth feeling abnormally dry as he licked over his claiming fangs. “You holding in over there, babe?” the dragon tamer asked his other mate, leaning over Leon to give Piers a small nestle of his own.</p><p>Piers shrugged, the edge of his tank top falling off his shoulder in the process.</p><p>“M’hangin’ in there. We both know our lovely Champion needed a knot way more than I did.” He teased with a slight crook to the corner of his mouth, though his breath hitched as Leon pushed back against him, giving him more room to grind. He was soaking wet, and Raihan could scent it as he drew in a deep breath through his muzzle.</p><p>Piers loved it when Raihan’s eyes constricted like a predator’s would. Nearly narrowed into slits. “Don’t worry, Stripes. I’ve got another round in me for you too.” He both threatened and promised, rutting his hips inside of Leon and hearing his mate whine in pleasure.</p><p>Reflexively Leon’s thighs attempted to clamp shut around Raihan, bearing down on the knot- but Piers made a desperate noise as he wrapped his arms around the former Champ’s thighs. He kept Leon’s legs spread wide open for Raihan to rut into. It gave Piers a better vantage point for humping against his partner’s back, and Raihan more room to roll his hips and loosen the knot that kept them together.</p><p>Slowly, almost in awe, Piers glanced over Leon’s shoulder to see where all that cock disappeared inside of his mate. He shuddered in excitement. “Bloody fuckin’ ‘ell, I can’t wait until all that is inside a’me.”</p><p>Raihan felt his own amusement surface as the knot began to deflate, slipping half out of Leon, the stretch making the poor Omega tense up and whine low and long. It was rough to pull it out again. “Agh-! Raihan, not so fast!” He begged with his head tilting to the side, inadvertently bumping against Piers in the process, causing their foreheads to nestle together and mouths to seek each other in a slow and needy kiss.</p><p>It relaxed Leon enough to allow for Raihan’s knot to slip out with a wet noise, a stream of cum and slick following the withdrawal. The noise that left their mate was absolutely <em>pornographic</em>.</p><p>“O-Oh, Rai…” Leon breathed out, his body finally slumping as the afterglow could properly settle without the additional stimuli to distract him. His mind was hazy as Piers fixed Raihan with an equally smug look, bringing his fingers down, hearing Leon whine mutely as he spread his hole open wide and let the cum drool out.</p><p>“You filled em up good! Hope you got an equally fat load for me, too.” He mumbled, letting Leon finally relax, squirming his way out from behind the man’s back. It let the worn out Omega settle back into their nest with a content noise. Leon cuddled into the nest with half-lidded eyes, his scent completely balanced…for the time being.</p><p>Instead it was Piers’s turn to crawl his way onto Leon’s chest. The smaller Omega was eager to straddle the other Omega’s lap, cuddling into his chest, coaxing his hair across a single shoulder and out of the way of his nape. It was a taunt to Raihan- as the Alpha could see Piers’s neck, but never quite bite down. “I need my Alpha’s cock filling me. Up to the challenge, big boy?” he asked while on all fours, reaching back to spread himself open to Raihan’s hungry gaze.</p><p>Leon was equally as embarrassed as the Omega’s groins pressed together, a hiccup of a moan leaving him when Piers ground their hips together. He shyly looked through his bangs as Raihan’s breath grew heavy once again.</p><p>The full mast of his cock hadn’t gone down in the slightest since his knot deflated, leaving him ready to go for another round. Those hands were so comically big compared to Piers’s tiny waist as he hoisted the singer up, angling him, until Piers had to rest his cheek and hands against Leon’s body to support himself. He bit his lower lip raw in anticipation. “Do I look like a snack, little drake? I wanna be fuckin’ pounded raw.” Piers moaned out low.</p><p>He got precisely the reaction that he wanted.</p><p>“I’m going to <em>ruin you</em>. Love it when you’re  confident like this.” He praised with a deep hiss, the bite of his claws making up for his muzzled state. He dragged them down Piers’s hipbones before pushing his own hips forward, slipping messily though the Omega’s puffy labia. Raihan grit his teeth hard when the action had him wildly humping back against his Alpha’s cock.</p><p>Once the head of his cock caught on Piers’s opening, he growled out, hearing the high pitched whine of relief when he buried inside once more. With all the attention he’d gotten from Leon before Raihan arrived, his hole was nice and loose.</p><p>He took Raihan effortlessly to the hilt, clenching down tight the entire while, even going so far as to <em>push</em> himself back against the Alpha’s hips. Piers knew his moan was borderline pornographic as he sang high and loud for Raihan, head thrown back in relief. “Ohfu<em>ckyes<strong>finally</strong></em>-“</p><p>It only got better when Leon wrapped his arms around Piers, his broad fingers working gentle circles across the punk’s lower back. “Isn’t he big?” Leon whispered hot against Piers’s ear.</p><p>It stoked Raihan’s ego something fierce as Piers ground himself back once more, his warm slit swallowing him effortlessly. He didn’t even have to do much more than roll their bodies together as Piers desperately chased his own pleasure, nuzzling against Leon, both of his Omegas smelling so sweet for <em>only</em> him. The clench of his internal walls were driving the Alpha positively wild.</p><p>“Oh, bloody fucking shit, <em>yes!” </em>Piers called out, head thrown back. The action only made him knock into that infuriating muzzle fit across Raihan’s mouth, the lack of teeth on his neck making his inner Omega grumpy. He reached back with searching hands until he could thread his fingers through the caging, pulling Raihan down.</p><p>He heard his Alpha’s rolling growl resound through his very core, clenching tight around his cock as the new angle pulled his shaft impossibly deeper. Piers groaned in relief as he kept Raihan bent <em>over</em> him.</p><p>“This stupid fuckin’ thing…” Piers drabbled on, giving it another yank, hearing how it stuttered Raihan’s breath and worked him up so good. He whined at the merciless pace that his Alpha pounded away inside of him. “I’ve got half a mind to rip the damn thing offa you.”</p><p>It made Piers pause for only a moment.</p><p>What was stopping him, anyways?</p><p>With his heat addled brain sending the rational part of his mind to the backseat, Piers reached back, moaning openly as he fumbled for the straps at the back of the damned cage. In his head there was <em>nothing</em> wrong with letting a rut-fueled, half feral Alpha out of his confines. “Fuck it. Want those fuckin’ canines buried deep in my shoulder.” He whispered, pupils heavily dilated as he felt the eager twitch of Raihan’s cock inside of him.</p><p>It took a hell of a lot of effort to do with one hand, but slowly Piers managed to fumble with the straps and buckles, shuddering in relief as the metal contraption fell off and bounced harmlessly off of his shoulder. He heard the crack of Raihan’s jaw as he was able to stretch it proper once more.</p><p>There was a brief prelude where neither of the trio spoke or moved, the tension in the air palatable as Raihan stared down at Piers, watching the Omega’s shoulders shift and roll as he pushed himself off of Leon’s chest with a lidded stare. There was something charged in those deep cerulean eyes as he fluttered his lashes at Raihan. “See something y’like?” he drawled slow, before tilting his neck and revealing the glitter of his collar.</p><p>Raihan snapped.</p><p>The Alpha surged forward to bury his teeth into the metal of the collar, smelling the source of Piers’s fertile heat, <em>chasing</em> it as he growled and snarled openly. No matter how he bit or scraped his teeth across the surface, he couldn’t claim Piers. But he <em>could</em> claim his pussy. There was something so depraved and desperate as Piers arched his hips into the contact, head tilted back to knock into Raihan’s shoulders.</p><p>“You two…” Leon piped in softly beneath them, his eyes blown wide in arousal as he watched the other two fuck like animals. It made him more than a little excited as he tried to close his legs tight, squeezing them together, chasing stimulation as his sticky and cum coated thighs slid effortlessly.</p><p>Leon shuddered as Raihan’s gaze fell upon him, starved in more than one way.</p><p>“Champ, y’liking the show?” The Alpha drawled thick and heavy, forcing his hand down over Piers’s shoulder to dig into the nest near Leon’s head. He stroked his thumb over Leon’s lower lip, before feeling Piers getting antsy, wiggling his hips from side to side and whining so sweetly. It drew his attention back into pounding inside of the singer, hearing his voice pitch in desperation.</p><p>The heat flaring between them was getting to be too intense to handle, his womb aching something fierce. He needed to cum. He needed Raihan’s knot. He needed…he needed his <em>bite</em>.</p><p>Without even a second though he reached back to fumble with the opening of his own collar, hating how well it worked. Marnie really had his best interest in mind when she bought them matching collars- insisting he use it during his unregulated heats. For his protection. It became a staple to his wardrobe, and only he could access it.</p><p>Though in his pleasured state? It was impossible to mess with the clasp in a proper way to get it off. The frustration kept mounting as he wriggled and rolled his hips into Raihan, feeling that telltale heat spreading throughout his lower abdomen. He wouldn’t last much longer.</p><p>“Raihan-!” He moaned out desperately, his nails digging into the metal as his Alpha redirected his teeth into his shoulder instead. It stung so fucking <em>good</em> as he used the grip to urge his cock deeper, keeping him still and pliant. “R-Rai, please, fuck me!” he whined out, his nails desperately dragging across the clasp. Each model opened a slightly different way.</p><p>He managed to press against the two buttons of the side, the glide of his nails finally succeeding in pulling the clasp apart. He groaned in relief as his collar fell off, joining the muzzle on the bed, where it lay forgotten and unneeded.</p><p>Piers’s scent glands were achingly sore as they throbbed over the side of his neck, small indents from the collar proving just how strong this heat was. His body was getting desperate for a mate.</p><p>He was sure there was a reason for that…but he couldn’t exactly recall it. Not with Leon leaning forward to mouth and lap at his neck, and Raihan’s heavy gaze flickering over to the discarded collar. With a flick of his wrist, both the muzzle and collar hit the floor with a dull thud, removed from the nest and finally out of the way.</p><p>In a way, Piers suddenly felt like prey, hearing the low growl that came from Raihan’s throat as he watched Leon mouth over him.</p><p>“N-Need it…C’mon, Rai, <em>fuck me good</em>.” He whispered, hands searching for purchase against the back of Leon’s neck. They weren’t the only one enjoying their little display. Raihan throbbed thick and heavy inside of him, the swell of his knot half inflated as it was. It caught on his walls from a lazy withdrawal, making Piers’s breath hitch.</p><p>The full stretch left him clambering back for more, claws digging into Leon’s skin as his Omegan partner whimpered out into their kiss.</p><p>The next push forward succeeded in knocking all of the air out of Piers’s lungs, back arching, body pressing closer to Leon’s as he spread his legs wide to properly take Raihan. It knocked deep inside of his body, bringing light just how comedic their size difference was at times. Frankly it was impressive he could even fit Raihan inside.</p><p>He wouldn’t be lasting much longer.</p><p>Piers’s walls clenched down on every thrust, sending sparks of stimulation up, his voice pitching into pure desperation the faster that Raihan moved. He was outright pounding away inside of him again. “How in the hell do you have…so, much, stamina!” The punk groaned, trying to keep his hips elevated, though he was rapidly losing his footing as Raihan bore down into him.</p><p>Raihan’s lip quirked in obvious amusement. “I’ve been training stamina all my life- the long haul is, mnn, kind of my battle style.”</p><p>Piers made a small noise at that, hiding further into Leon’s neck as he let out a particularly long moan, his insides clenching tight as he felt Raihan’s nails drag down his waist. He was so close, he was so fucking close it hurt-</p><p>Leon was the surprising twist that they all needed. He groaned deep as he reached around to grab Piers’s ass, spreading him open, fixing Raihan with a pleading look as he pushed their hips together. It was so utterly filthy and unanticipated coming from their typically put-together mate. “Raihan,<em> please</em>. Fill him up good, and make sure not a single drop escapes.” He purred, nuzzling the opposite side of Piers’s neck. “I want another turn too.”</p><p>Piers swore he saw white.</p><p>If he thought Raihan had been going fast before, it paled in comparison to this, his body shaking hard as he came around the cock filling him. His walls clenched and milked around the dragon tamer’s shaft while all he could do was hold on for dear fucking life. “Oh, oh, oh god! Fuh…Fucckk!” He screamed out, not even realizing how loud he was until Leon’s tongue was shoved into his mouth, stifling him.</p><p>It grounded him- kissing his mate while that excessively large knot popped deep inside of him. He whined and whimpered sloppily into the contact, swirling his tongue around Leon’s, distracting from how difficult it was to take his Alpha’s knot. It ballooned up inside of him, stretching his walls to the point of discomfort.</p><p>He shuddered at the first feeling of warmth filling him up, having to grip for support as it just kept coming. His hole was already filled to capacity from his Alpha’s cock alone- it left almost no room for the excessive amount of cum pouring into him, making him whine at the intense stretch that followed.</p><p>Piers must have been squirming more than he thought, since he froze as fingers carded into his hair, pulling his head up and forcing his back to arch. He clenched tighter as his mouth was removed from Leon’s, tongue lolled out and eyes rolled back in bliss. “O-Oh….<em>Yesssss</em>…” he breathed out, panting loud as Raihan’s cock rutted lazily inside of him, emptying himself inside of Piers.</p><p>What he didn’t expect was for hot breath to fan across his very much exposed scent gland.</p><p>The Alpha’s teeth were a warning sign to what was about to happen, yet Piers didn’t mind, his instincts making him still and pliant as he tilted his chin back to give Raihan better access. He shuddered openly when that hot tongue spread over the side, curling his fingers against Leon’s chest. “Yes, Alpha! Mark me, fuck. Need your mark..!”</p><p>Perhaps if they were all in a clearer mindset, or maybe had another moment to think about the long term, Raihan would have stopped there and pulled back.</p><p>But they weren’t.</p><p>So with a strong clamp of his jaw, Piers <strong>screamed</strong>, his head thrown back against Raihan’s shoulder as his body burst forth into another strong orgasm. The clamp of those canines had broken through, releasing the sweetest of pairbonding pheromones, sending Piers into an endorphin high that could rival every drug he’d ever taken combined. His body felt as though he were floating as Raihan’s teeth kept him grounded and pliant, letting him rut wildly into his clenching hole.</p><p>He didn’t even register Leon’s soft voice and gentle fingers running through his hair until those teeth finally pulled free from his neck, leaving him slumped down and near hyperventilating from the intensity of his release.</p><p>Piers found himself wrapped up tight in both of his mate’s arms, head swimming, but so pleasantly lost in the combined scents of his mates. It made it difficult to come back to the present moment. He whined mutely when he shifted, hips aching something fierce. Idly he blew a piece of black and white hair out of his face as he turned to stare at his blissed-out Alpha. “H-Holy hell…Give a guy some warnin’ next time.”</p><p>He should have expected the doped out rumble he got in return.</p><p>Piers’s abdomen felt bloated as he forced himself to put some weight off of Leon’s chest, noticing how flushed and embarrassed his partner looked. The punk offered him a half-smile as he pressed their noses together with a soft hum. “Fuck, Lee, thanks fer keepin’ my head in place there. It was…”</p><p>Intense. The only way to describe it was intense. The afterglow kept him from freaking out about the bite in his neck too much, but in truth? He couldn’t exactly find a reason to be mad or afraid. They’d been fucking for so many years, and already saw each other in a close light. It wouldn’t be too big of a change, would it?</p><p>Leon pawed at his spine and shoulders with a small shudder, the emotions swimming in those deep gold irises giving him pause. Judging by the heated flush that crawled down Leon’s chest and abdomen, it seemed that round two was needed, making Piers’s lip curl. He leaned down to press their cheeks together, clenching tight around Raihan to make his Alpha groan.</p><p>“Didya wanna get marked too?” he asked in a low tone, and that <em>really</em> perked Raihan up again. Leon was panting so sweetly as he tried not to show how affected he was, turning his head to the side and trying not to make it too obvious. His voice was oh so tiny as he bit his puffy lower lip raw. “<em>Maybe…”</em></p><p>All it took was a single shared look between Raihan and Piers for a mutual consensus to be reached.</p><p>After all, they <em>were</em> a trio, and it simply wouldn’t be fair for only Piers to wear a mark on his neck. It looks as though Raihan would be in it for the long haul tonight…and may just come out with two matching marks on both sides of his neck.</p><p>There certainly could be<em> worse</em> ways to end their night.</p>
