    <p>Small Blessings</p><p> </p><p>Music poured from the corners of the bright, hot room, charmed from the walls themselves, making the floor vibrate and the air seem to throb.  The make-up girl rocked side to side as she brushed a glimmering translucent powder made from powdered unicorn horn onto a firm, striated stomach, and the hair dresser paused in the midst of perfecting a slightly tousled ‘bed head’ look on gleaming white-blond hair to execute a series of tight spins.  The photographer and lighting man exchanged a wry look as they positioned the free floating light orbs and the wardrobe mistress laughed, but the figure at the center of everyone’s attention seemed unaware of the controlled madness going on around him.  He stood, hips slightly forward, eyes closed, the bare toes on his left foot moving slightly to the beat.  White silk pajama bottoms clung to sharp hipbones and a long sleeved, tailored top was unbuttoned over his chest, revealing the toned, slender body.  He looked like he’d just woken up after a spectacular shag, which, not coincidentally, was precisely the look they were going for.</p><p>“Ready whenever you are,” the photographer called, and Draco Malfoy took a deep breath, letting his eyes drift open.  The makeup girl lifted a mascara brush towards his long lashes, but he merely brushed her hand away.  </p><p>“I’m wearing enough,” he said firmly.  “I don’t want to look like a drag queen, thanks.”</p><p>He turned towards the set, which consisted of a wide, queen sized mattress covered in black satin sheets and a black- and silver-printed down duvet, artfully arranged to look as if it had just been kicked back.  There was a young man already lying on the mattress on his stomach, pillow curled beneath his cheek, his tawny skin gleaming in the hot lights, his tousled black hair falling in ragged curls over his forehead.  He was nude, and his muscled arse flexed slightly as he moved his legs to make room for Draco as he lay down on his back beside him.  Immediately, there were at least three dressers who sprang into action.  One situated a pillow beneath his head, one arranged the duvet over one sleek bare foot, another smoothed the folds of his shirt, arranging the way it draped over his side and the sheets.  The hairdresser fussed with his hair, while the makeup girl powdered his nose.</p><p>The man at his side smirked at him, brown eyes alight with amusement.  “You sure get the ‘star treatment’, don’t you?”</p><p>“That’s because I’m the star,” he answered, shooting the other man an arch look before turning back to watch the photographer levitate a small platform into position to look through his view finder at the set-up.  His face appeared beside the large camera.</p><p>“Draco, sweetheart, I think you’re going to want to appear more… ‘interested in the proceedings’, don’t you?”</p><p>Draco rolled his eyes, but glanced to his left.  Immediately a slender brunet with wide blue eyes and a slight build came and knelt at his side.  With a businesslike approach that was almost clinical, he covered the soft bulge at the apex of Draco’s thighs and began to caress him efficiently.  Draco closed his eyes as the hand worked him, concentrated on the sensation, and felt himself begin to fill.</p><p>“I could do that for you, you know.”</p><p>He rolled his head to the side and met the brown eyes.  “You’re set dressing, darling.  Your job is to have a nice arse.  His job,” he gestured with his chin towards the man who was stroking his dick, “is to get me hard. Everyone serves their purpose.  It keeps things from getting complicated.”  He felt his cock lengthening and hardening, and reached down to push the man’s hands away.  “That’s sufficient, thank you. We aren’t shooting porn, here.”</p><p>The young man nodded and tactfully disappeared.</p><p>Draco adjusted himself beneath the clinging fabric, then looked back up at the photographer, his brows raised.</p><p>“Perfect,” the man called.  “All right, boys and girls, crank up the volume and let’s do this thing.”</p><p>The music immediately grew louder, the bass throbbing through the floorboards.  Draco looked up from beneath his lashes, going into ‘performance’ mode.  The man at his side closed his eyes and feigned sleep, and Draco kept his eyes glued to the camera lens.  He ran one hand down his stomach slowly, the other stroking the smooth back at his side, dropping to a hard arse cheek, his fingers flexing in the pliable flesh.  He did different variations of the same movements for several minutes, eyes seducing the camera.  He was aware of the almost reverent expressions of those around him. They looked at him like he was a rock star, which in a very real way, he was. He was good; sex on a stick, he’d been told more than once, and as he moved sinuously over the shining black fabric, he used every trick he knew.  When the photographer finally said “I think we’ve got it,” even he sounded breathless. </p><p>Draco sat up, pushing the hair from his face, taking the hand that was offered to help him to his feet.  </p><p>“What next, Draco?” one of the dressers asked.  He looked thoughtfully at the rack of slinky pajamas and dressing gowns that hung nearby.  </p><p>“I think that’ll be it for today,” he said.  “We’ve enough for the ads; we can worry about the catalog next week.  Thanks, everyone.”</p><p>The music was abruptly shut off, and there was a different kind of bustle as the crew put away the tools of their individual trades.  Draco’s assistant, Miles, approached even as Draco felt a hand on his arm.  He looked up to find the other model, still nude and half hard, standing next to him, a slight grin on his handsome face.</p><p>In response, Draco merely arched his brow.  </p><p>“I was thinking, you know, drinks? Dinner?” the other man said hopefully, brown eyes wide.  Brown eyes.  Draco didn’t do brown eyes. </p><p>“Are you serious?” he asked wryly. “Look, you’ve a lovely arse, but you were hired for that, and only that.  And, do put on some pants.  No one is interested in what you’re advertising.”</p><p>He saw the rusty stain begin to spread up his chest as the model took a step back.  “You’re a right bitch, aren’t you?” he hissed.</p><p>“I am,” Draco answered imperturbably.  “And you just talked yourself out of another three days work.  I’ll make sure you get your check.”</p><p>Their eyes held for a long moment before the man turned on his heel and stalked away.</p><p>“Brrr.”</p><p>Draco glanced at Miles as he turned, slipping the pajama top from his shoulders and tossing it to one of the dressers who stood nearby. </p><p>“He probably should put on some trousers before the tone of that dismissal freezes his poor willy off.”</p><p>Draco grimaced.  “Lovely description,” he muttered.  “Clearly, you missed your calling in creative writing.”</p><p>Miles smirked as he watched the dismissed model storm, still naked, from the studio.  “He does, indeed, have a very nice arse.”</p><p>Draco shook his head as he pushed the silk trousers down and stepped out of them, handing them off as well.  His nudity didn’t disturb him in the slightest.  “I don’t fuck the help,” he said, shooting Miles a pointed look.  “As you well know.”</p><p>“Ouch,” Miles replied without a hint of chagrin.  He stood by respectfully as Draco donned black pants and then black wool slacks.  </p><p>“I’m assuming you wanted something?” Draco asked as he slipped on a white button down, rolling up the sleeves to his elbows.  </p><p>“Several things, actually,” Miles answered, all business.  “We’ve had orders from both Twilfit and Tattings and Madam Malkins…”</p><p>Draco grinned.  “I knew the old bitch would cave.”</p><p>“Well, she’s not stupid,” Miles said.  “She wants a piece of you.”</p><p>Draco shuddered theatrically.  “A prospect I find disturbing on any number of levels.”</p><p>Miles grinned.  “And, interestingly enough, that silk supplier in China who originally didn’t want to deal with us has now changed his mind.  What exactly did you threaten him with?”</p><p>Draco didn’t answer; merely smirked.  Miles shook his head.  “You are singularly terrifying.”</p><p>“What else?”</p><p>“That’s all the business.”</p><p>“Light morning,” Draco said, buttoning his shirt.  “Good.  I’ll have time to look over the proofs, then…”</p><p>“I said it’s all of the business,” Miles repeated, his tone cautious for the first time.  “There is, however, this.”</p><p>He held out the neatly folded parchment, the dark green seal on the back visible.  Draco went still, his hands paused on his buttons. He hesitated, then took the note from Miles' hand.  </p><p>His heart was pounding against his breast bone.  He’d not heard anything in more than a decade; not from the moment he’d packed his trunk and left the Manor, determined to be out from under the weight of being ‘the Malfoy Heir’ and everything that came with it.  Paris had offered him just enough space.  He was still known as ‘the wild Malfoy’, but the Parisian’s hadn’t given a damn, and in a very real sense had adopted him as one of their own.  </p><p>He turned the thick square of parchment in his hand, studying the feminine handwriting on the face but not opening it.</p><p>“Do you want me to dispose of it?” Miles asked when Draco merely stared at it.  </p><p>“No,” Draco answered, still staring at his mother’s lovely script.  She’d written, “My darling Draco”, the way she had on all of his birthday cards, and Christmas gifts, and the sweets she’d sent to him at Hogwarts. How was it, he wondered, that just those three words could make his heart ache so?  He cleared his throat.  “It’s from my mother,” he murmured, still staring at the beautifully etched words.  “At least it’s not from my father.”  He snorted.  “Maybe I’ll get lucky, and this is to tell me that the old bastard has finally died.”  He turned and stalked away.</p><p>~~~***~~~</p><p> </p><p>Harry Potter pulled on his trainers, tying them tightly before pushing up from the edge of his bed and making his way down the stairs.  It was Sunday morning, and before he even got as far as the landing, he could hear high-pitched voices carrying through the old house.  He smiled as ran his hand through his hair and took the remaining stairs two at a time.  Sunday mornings meant bacon, and he loved bacon.</p><p>Grimmauld Place was a very different house than the one Harry had inherited. The tattered wall paper and threadbare carpets were gone, dark objects banished or destroyed. The walls were washed with pale blue paint and the hardwood floors were polished until they gleamed.  Colorful rag rugs hand knotted by Molly Weasley dotted the long halls and filled the center of the homey rooms, and the sound of children’s laughter reverberated where once only darkness and decay had dwelled.  As Harry moved towards the second set of stairs that led down to the basement kitchen, he noticed the new ‘art’ on the walls with an indulgent smile.  Crayola on parchment had become one of his favorite things. 	</p><p>When Harry had first ended the evil bastard who had dominated his existence, he’d had very little idea what he wanted to do with his life.  Once it became clear that he would, indeed, survive beyond seventeen, he’d really only known one thing for sure; he no longer wanted to be an Auror.  He’d spent nearly half of his life chasing or being chased by the worst of the worst; now, he simply wanted to do something that mattered.</p><p>He’d gone back for his eighth and final year at Hogwarts, done respectably on his NEWT’s, but after receiving his scores had reached only two conclusions.  One; he thought he might like to try to do something to help rebuild the wizarding community after the war.  And two; he no longer had any desire to marry Ginny Weasley.  The first impulse had everything to do with the suffering and lack that was still was so apparent, with no solution in sight.  The second he could attribute to noticing that Michael Corner had a very nice arse.  </p><p>When he’d first realized that he found Ginny’s ex-boyfriend far more alluring than he found her, he’d been rocked to his toes.  He’d been so pre-occupied with his epic battle against evil that he really hadn’t paid that much attention to what made his dick hard.  He’d liked kissing Cho, sort of.  He’d liked kissing Ginny more. But, much as he loved her, the sex they’d had had felt forced, and awkward.  It wasn’t until he’d felt a man’s mouth on his cock for the first time that he’d understood why.</p><p>Carefully placing his sexuality on a very high shelf, only taken out on the odd weekend and only then in Muggle clubs where no one would recognize him, he’d regretfully told Ginny that he just didn’t love her the way that he needed to in order to be her husband. To his surprise, Ginny had understood.  Molly, on the other hand, had not.  It had taken several years to get back into her good graces, and only then because Ginny had married Neville and presented her with a lovely grandson named Frank.</p><p>His preferences sorted, Harry had still felt frustrated with what he was doing with his life.  Immediately drawn to the Department of Children and Family Services, and faced with the reality of the abandoned and orphaned children that the war had caused, Harry had chaffed at the endless miles of red tape. Orphanages were crowded to the breaking point, there weren’t enough of them, and children sat in St. Mungo’s with nowhere else to go.  Each of those sad little orphans seemed to cry out to him, and the reminder of their haunted eyes kept him awake nights.  Even in his life, even in a cupboard under the stairs, he’d not been abandoned to the ‘system’.  </p><p>It had been Luna who had first made the suggestion that would define his life.</p><p>“You have that large house, Harry,” she said. She lowered her voice, her expression kind.  “It would be a way for you to have the big family you’ve always wanted, wouldn’t it?”  He never discussed his orientation with Luna, but in the way she knew any number of things, she’d known. “And there are so many children now who merely need somewhere to go. And they’d get something with you they wouldn’t get at those other places they send them.” He looked at her, expression quizzical. “You’ll love them all.” </p><p>Getting clearance to open an orphanage had been a bureaucratic nightmare.  But at the age of twenty and a few months, after extensively remodeling Grimmauld Place, Harry Potter had opened the Lily Evans Potter Resource Center for Abandoned and Orphaned Children, which quickly became known as ‘Lily’s House’.  He doubted they’d have ever been able to do it if times hadn’t been so desperate; he was young and completely inexperienced, but the need was great. He hired a full time cook and a lovely elderly witch named Eleanor who had acted as nanny for several wizarding children, and they’d opened their doors to three small boys.  Harry had been very nervous in the beginning, certain he would be pants at even surrogate parenting.  He hadn’t been, and by the time they reached their first Christmas they were the full time home to twelve orphaned children between the ages of 6 months and ten years.  And Luna had been right; Harry loved them all.</p><p>He continued down the hallway and arrived at the kitchen doorway to one of his favorite scenes; the kids, in all of their messy, imperfect, syrup-stained, bed-headed, bleary-eyed morning glory.  There was no evidence of uniforms at breakfast; pajamas were the uniform of the day.</p><p>“Good morning!” he said brightly, rubbing his hands together as he came into the room.  Heads turned, smiles bloomed.</p><p>“Morning, Harry!” they called in anything but unison.  </p><p>“Harry, I has blueberries, see?”</p><p>“I see that, Millie,” Harry answered, smoothing his hand over the cherubic three-year-old's strawberry blond curls.</p><p>“Harry, Harry, Harry…”</p><p>“Yes, Zach,” Harry laughed as he turned to a feisty five-year-old who was bouncing up and down in his seat.</p><p>“It came out!  See?” He grinned widely, and Harry leaned closer to admire the gap in his front teeth.  </p><p>“So it did!” he said in approval.</p><p>“Bacon, Harry?” </p><p>Margaret turned at the stove, wearing an apron that read “I brake for brats” tied around her ample waist, gun-metal gray curls askew and a smile on her weathered face.  </p><p>“You know me too well, Maggie.”  He inhaled deeply. “Gods, I love Sunday mornings.”</p><p>“How you stay so thin is beyond me, the way that you eat.”</p><p>Harry hadn’t noticed the fashionably dressed woman seated near the far end of the table, and he straightened when he saw her.  Her short clipped mahogany hair gleaming in the light, black wool ‘power’ suit immaculate, the only nod to femininity the perfect strand of pearls around her throat.  </p><p>“Why, Ms. Parkinson,” he said, one dark brow arched in amusement.  “To what do we owe the pleasure of your company?  And before noon, no less.” </p><p>She gave him a withering smile.  “Why, to the brilliance of your presence, of course.”  She rolled her eyes and he grinned.</p><p>“Daddy!”</p><p>The high-pitched squeal brought Harry around, and he held out his arms to catch the tow-headed blur as it launched itself at his knees.  Laughing, he swung the slight five-year-old up and onto his hip.  </p><p>“Well, hello there,” he said warmly, looking into pale blue eyes.  “Did you just wake up?”</p><p>The little head nodded.  “I was sleeping.  Dreaming about dragons.”</p><p>“Ah,” Harry said, making his way towards his chair at the end of the table next to Pansy’s, ruffling hair and exchanging smiles as he went. “Were they scary dragons?”</p><p>The little brow furrowed, the small nose scrunched.  “No!” he said, indignant.  “You weren’t scared of dragons, and neither am I.”</p><p>“Oh, I think your father was plenty scared of that dragon,” Pansy countered as Harry lowered the little boy into his chair.  There was a thick telephone book already in place to lift him up higher in the seat.  “I was <i>there</i>; I saw him turn tail and run.”</p><p>The small face scrunched up mutinously.  “He was not scared,” he said firmly. “My daddy is not scared of <i>anything</i>.”</p><p>Harry shot her a triumphant grin as he pulled out his own chair.  </p><p>“Except perhaps a middle-aged red-headed witch with a deep seated desire for several dark-haired grandchildren,” Pansy drawled.  Harry sent her a quelling look.</p><p>“Stow it, you.”</p><p>He smiled up at Maggie as she set his plate in front of him; half a dozen slices of bacon, three eggs and a stack of toast.  The feisty five-year-year old received a plate of small blueberry pancakes.  </p><p>“Thank you, Maggie,” he said, then turned to Harry.  “Say ‘thank you to Maggie’,” he instructed.  Harry fought the urge to laugh.</p><p>“Thanks, Maggie,” he said instead.</p><p>“You’re both most welcome.”  She smiled and made her way back to the stove, and Harry picked up the child’s plate, neatly cutting the pancakes into small, bite-sized pieces.</p><p>When he’d opened the orphanage, his thought had been to provide a loving environment for as many children as he could while they searched for proper adoptive parents for them.  He had never, ever considered the possibility of adopting any of the children himself.  He was single, and he was gay; it had simply seemed an insurmountable obstacle to actual parenthood, no matter how much he longed for it.  But then, one night in December when he’d been twenty-four, someone had rung the doorbell at just after midnight.  Harry had staggered down the stairs; it wasn’t that uncommon for social services to show up in the middle of the night with a child in need of shelter. </p><p>When he’d opened the front door, at first he’d thought that no one was there.  He’d started to close the door again, aggravated and cold, when he’d noticed what looked like a rolled blanket on his front mat.  It wasn’t until he’d bent over that he realized it wasn’t a blanket, but a baby, with a note pinned to what looked like a hand knitted baby blanket.  Immediately, he’d been thrown back to a conversation he’d once had with McGonagall.</p><p>“You were wrapped in a hand knitted afghan,” she’d said, faded eyes misty. “Albus lay you on the front mat with a note on your chest.  Walking away from you was the hardest thing I’ve ever done, but he’d been so sure it was the right thing...”</p><p>Harry had lifted the bundle into his arms.  It had been so light, and the baby inside of it had been so still.  He closed the door and staggered a few steps, his eyes on the little face, blue with cold, and the small heart shaped mouth, lips faintly purple.  The child hadn’t moved, and he’d been so afraid that it was dead.  But then a small hand had appeared, and little fingers, long like a spider monkey's, had flexed and spread.  Harry had poked it with his index finger, and instantly it had latched on with a surprisingly firm grip. When the tiny eyes had opened and looked unblinking up into his face, for the first time in his life Harry Potter knew what it was to be in love. </p><p>He wakened the ‘mum on duty’, which was what his helpers were called, and rushed the infant to St. Mungo’s. They took it from Harry’s arms and whisked it away, and he’d been left to sit on one of the unforgiving chairs in the hallway, the blanket with the note attached in his hands. After watching the medical staff come and go for nearly an hour, he remembered the note and read it.</p><p>“His name is Addison,” it said in a ragged scrawl.  “I’m dying, and his father won’t care that he exists.  Please take care of him.”</p><p>‘It’ was a ‘he’.  Named Addison.  Whose mother had probably used the last of her strength to bring him to Harry’s door.    </p><p>Addison was in hospital for nearly three months.  They figured he was maybe a month old.  He had been premature, and had pneumonia. He was also underweight, and malnourished.  There were piles of paperwork to be filled out, and because Addison had been abandoned and was so ill, Harry knew that Social Services would suggest he be placed in foster care.  </p><p>There were long nights, when Harry finished up at the orphanage and he would don his heavy coat and go to St. Mungo’s.  Early on, one of the nurses had told him that children as young as Addison needed to be held, to feel secure, that it helped speed their recovery time. He was there, holding him for each landmark, and each setback.  He was on a first name basis with all of the pediatric ICU staff, and they took to bringing him coffee and blankets. It was during one of those seemingly endless nights, while Addison slept in his arms, his weight sweet against Harry’s chest, that Harry realized he couldn’t bear to be parted from him.  He started adoption proceedings the next day.</p><p>He’d known it wouldn’t be easy.  If they wanted to, the committee who finalized adoptions could find any number of reasons why he wouldn’t be a suitable parent.  When he’d donned his best suit and nervously arrived for his interview, he’d almost moaned aloud when he’d seen Pansy Parkinson seated on the panel of four.  Parkinson’s family had endowed the pediatric wing.  He was quite certain that she’d do everything she could to block him at every turn.  </p><p>But he’d been surprised when she had seemed completely decent.  The others had been either awed by his fame or irritated by it.  One member had told him that she felt he shouldn’t be able to adopt <i>because </i> of who he was, and that it might not be safe for any child to be around him, his work with the orphanage not withstanding. There had been a heated debate about it, right there in front of him.  But it had been Pansy who had finally turned to him and said, in a very sincere tone; “Mr. Potter, why this baby?  Why not one of the others?”</p><p>He’d met her gaze unflinchingly.  “Because his mother left a note, specifically asking me to take care of him.”  He’d paused before going on.  “And I… I promised him.”</p><p>“You promised him,” another member said.  “He’s four months old, Mr. Potter.  He doesn’t have a clue what you promised him.”</p><p>“You’re right,” Harry agreed.  “He doesn’t.  But I do.”</p><p>In the end, the vote was three to one in favor of Harry’s petition.  Addison Doe became Addison James Potter.  Harry was still in the hallway, being enthusiastically hugged by Hermione and Ron and Ginny in turn, when someone behind him cleared their throat.  Harry knew it was Parkinson even before he turned, just by the sour looks on his friends faces. </p><p>“It’s okay, guys,” he said quickly.  “You go on and get us a table at the Leaky.  I’ll be along in a minute.”</p><p>They’d left, but the looks they’d shot over their shoulders had spoken volumes about how they felt about it.  Harry had turned to Pansy, his hands in his pockets.</p><p>“Thank you,” he murmured.  “I know you must have been the deciding vote.”  She didn’t verify it, but she didn’t have to.  </p><p>“You know,” she said instead.  “You surprised me in there.”</p><p>“I did?” he asked.  “Why?”</p><p>“Because you so clearly love him. Did it ever occur to you that you have no idea where he came from?  He could be anyone, Potter.  We know from his hospital records that he has a magical signature, but nothing else about him. His parents could be purebloods.  They could have been Death Eaters.”</p><p>“So?” he countered. She shook her head.</p><p>“You really don’t care,” she said, sounding mystified.  “His blood doesn’t matter to you at all.”</p><p>“Parkinson, he’s a baby.  He’s not defined by his <i>blood</i>.” He sighed.  “Look, we fought a war over that nonsense.  Pure-blood, half-blood, Muggle.  It just really doesn’t matter.  He’s a baby, and he needs someone to take care of him, and to love him, and to let him know he’s safe.  And I’m going to do it.”  He started to turn, but then turned back.  “And for the record?  I don’t think any of us are defined by our blood.  Including you.”  He smiled at her then, and after a moment, she hesitantly returned it.</p><p>He hadn’t been surprised when she’d started turning up at ‘Lily’s House’ with little gifts for Addison, or when she’d made sizable donation for the kids.  Over the four years since Addison had come into both of their lives, they’d first become wary acquaintances, then as time went by, good friends.  He appreciated her biting wit and common sense, and she loved spending time with all of the children more than she’d let on.  Now, she was there several days a week and even occasionally managed to get papier mache in her hair, and he loved her for it.  Addison called her ‘Auntie Pansy’, and between the three of them and the other children and the extended staff, they’d created a family.  </p><p>He handed Addison back his plate of now neatly sectioned pancakes, and picked up a piece of bacon, biting into it and rolling his eyes in bliss.  </p><p>“You and your pork,” Pansy huffed, shaking her head as she picked up a magazine she’d brought with her.  “There’s a joke in there somewhere, but it would probably be inappropriate.”  Harry shot her a look but didn’t stop chewing.  “So, what are you boys up to today?”</p><p>“I think,” Harry said, wiping his hands on his napkin and picking up his fork.  “A bit of air time might be in order.”</p><p>There were cheers and applause around the table from all but the youngest of the children.  Harry was a firm believer that magical children needed to learn to safely ride a broom before they got to Hogwarts.  He didn’t want any of ‘his kids’ to be at a disadvantage.  He started putting them on trainer brooms, well supervised, when they were four.  “Ron and Ginny are going to come over, and we’re taking them to the park.  How about you?”</p><p>Pansy made a face.  “Brunch with Mother.  Shoot me now.”</p><p>Harry just smiled and ate his eggs while Pansy continued to leaf through her magazine.  After a moment, she made a soft sound and Harry looked over.</p><p>Carefully keeping the image turned from the children, Pansy turned it so that Harry could see the full page add.  It was glossy and slick, in artful black and white photography.  The image was of a man, lying on his back on black satin sheets, wearing white silk pajamas.  He was very blond and very fit, and as Harry watched he moved his hand down the back of a man lying on his stomach beside him, curling his hand around one firm arse cheek and squeezing.  A slight smirk played around his mouth, his eyes seduced the viewer, and if the obvious state of his body was any indication, he was enjoying himself. Across the bottom in bold white print were the words: “Designs for Seduction, by DMalfoy.  Because your greatest adventures should take place in bed.”</p><p>“He certainly seems to be doing all right for himself,” Harry muttered, tearing his eyes from the ad and taking a bite of toast. He knew he was coloring when Pansy raised a brow at him.</p><p>“You can’t deny he’s beautiful,” she said with a slight smirk.  </p><p>“Being beautiful has never been his problem,” Harry said, finishing his toast and wiping his mouth.  “Being a great prat has been.”</p><p>“And yet…”  She let the words hang teasingly, and Harry sent her a dark look.  A New Year’s Eve, several bottles of champagne and some drunken confessions, and Pansy still had ammunition if she ever chose to use it.  Fortunately, she knew when to stop her taunting, and merely smiled.  The doorbell echoed through the house, and Harry pushed back his chair and bounded to his feet.</p><p>“That’ll be Ron and Ginny. Last one out of their jammies carries the brooms!” he called out, and there was general pandemonium as the older children, including Addison, streaked from the room.  The sound of them thundering up the stairs could be heard throughout the house.  </p><p>“You be careful,” Pansy said as Harry paused to nuzzle one of the babies on her grubby, blueberry streaked cheek. She giggled merrily. “No more showing them that…Wronski thing.  You aren’t sixteen anymore.”  Harry came back to her, kissing her cheek as well.</p><p>“Yes, Mum,” he said, rubbing his chin against her neck.  She shuddered and pushed him away.</p><p>“Oh, go and shave, you heathen.”  </p><p>He was still laughing when he left the room. </p><p>Pansy looked down at the image of her childhood friend, reaching out to wistfully touch the white blond hair with one perfectly manicured fingernail.  “You are beautiful,” she murmured, and the slow smile that pulled at the generous mouth seemed to answer her.</p><p>~~~***~~~</p><p> </p><p>Being the Prodigal Son was a pain in the arse, Draco reflected as he finally arrived at the gate to the Manor. Certain he’d be forced into a formal meeting with the Patriarch, he’d dressed with care.  Gone were his usual stylishly cut Muggle slacks and jackets, skinny ties, tailored button downs.  In their place were gray cashmere wizard’s robes, elaborately embroidered across the breast and belted at the waist, and a heavy grey velvet over-coat with a chinchilla collar.  He thought he might have over-done it, just a bit, smoothing the butter soft grey leather gloves over his fingers, but he wanted to make it abundantly clear to his parents that he could take care of himself.  If he had to be in the ruddy pile of stones, he’d do it on his own terms.</p><p>He’d had no intention of ever returning to Wiltshire.  The final fight, the one that had driven him out of the Manor, had been apocalyptic. Lucius had discovered a photograph of Draco kissing Blaise Zabini in the Slytherin common room.  He and Blaise had never been lovers, but Lucius’ nasty comments had been enough to have Draco coming out to his father at full volume.  He and Lucius had argued viciously; he’d been saved from committing patricide only by the timely intervention of his mother.  But once he’d been out the door, he’d never asked for a dime, and he’d never looked back.</p><p>He started out staying with Blaise and his mother in Tuscany, and as the Countess ‘Zabini-whatever her name was this week’ was never at a loss for beautiful sycophants and wealthy hangers-on, it hadn’t taken Draco long to find one interested in making the Malfoy heir his boy toy.  He’d been older, and married, but that hadn’t bothered Draco in the slightest.  He was rich, and had enjoyed indulging his young lover.  Draco and Blaise cut a wide swath through Italy’s trendy wizard jet-set, then France’s.  Beautiful and indulged, they made a striking contrast: Draco, so fair and slender; Blaise, dark, elegant, brooding.  Photographer’s loved them, and the media outside of Britain couldn’t have cared less about their questionable allegiances during the war.  They became the ‘it’ boys, followed by paparazzi, photographed coming out of restaurants and night clubs, celebrities due to little more than their good looks and their family connections. </p><p>Draco’s older lover lasted until a younger, richer one came along.  This one had a taste for fine wine and fast cars, and introduced him to several illegal potions that chased away any lingering nightmares and the memories of his father’s disappointment.  In fact, for several years Draco made a point to behave as outrageously as possible, knowing his father would see his exploits in the press.  He dressed in only designer clothes, was photographed at Paris Fashion Week, and was even convinced to walk the runway one year.  He wore dark kohl around his eyes and lip gloss on his lips, and gelled his hair into fashionable disarray.  He gambled and drank, did a wild array of drugs and fucked anything he chose, moving through his early twenties in a dizzying haze.  </p><p>Then, when he’d just turned twenty-five, he’d gotten a hold of a bad batch of potion that had sent him to the hospital psyche ward for nearly a week.  Instead of taking the nightmarish images away in a wash of golden pleasure, this time it had made the memories worse; he was back in the Manor, seated at the table with the madman while that hideous serpent devoured one of his teachers before his eyes.  He’d been on the Astronomy Tower, watching as the green blast had hit the old man in the chest.  He’d been in the room of hidden things, and the fire had been spawned straight from hell, only this time there was no one to save him, and the demons were in his head, in his chest, in his veins.  He'd screamed and thrashed, unable to escape, trapped within the horrors that his mind had tried, unsuccessfully, to exorcise.</p><p>When he’d finally come to his senses, he’d been lying on the floor in a padded cell, his arms strapped to his body in a straight jacket.  He’d spent another few days in hospital under observation, but he knew before he ever walked out of the doors that the wild life was over.  He’d never take another hallucinogenic again.  There were still too many horrors locked away in his mind, and they needed to stay there.</p><p>Unsure how to proceed, it was that very first lover who provided him with a direction.  He’d been back at Blaise’s, taking a solemn inventory of his life, when the man had asked to see him.  His spectacular meltdown had been front page news, and this man was perhaps the only one who still actually cared about him.</p><p>Draco greeted him shyly on the terrace, and was astounded when he presented him with a check for a hundred thousand galleons.</p><p>“What is this for?” he asked suspiciously, looking into the man’s weathered face.  “I won’t…”</p><p>He held up his hand, his eyes kind.  “It is to start over, my young friend.  Take your time, but find out where your passion lies.  I have every faith that you’ll be able to pay it back some day, with interest.  But do not sell yourself short, Draco.  There is more to you than you know.”  He smiled a bit sadly then, and left Draco believing he was quite mad.</p><p>But it also made him think.  <i>‘There is more to you than you think.’</i> Was there?  He’d been reminded that he was little more than a spectacular disappointment for much of his life.  This was the first time anyone had told him otherwise. </p><p>And supposing he did want to make something of himself.  What were his passions, really? He smirked.  Sex, his mind answered immediately.  Sex, and clothes.  </p><p>Sex… and clothes.  </p><p>Hmmm…</p><p>From that realization had been born ‘Designs for Seduction by DMalfoy’.  He designed men’s lounge wear; sexy men’s loungewear, for the ‘gigolo at the heart of the elegant man’.  At first, people in the fashion industry thought him completely insane, but he used the hundred thousand galleons to start his first line, doing all of the drawings himself, hiring out the sewing, hiring Blaise to produce the first ad layout for Wizards Quarterly.  Initially he wanted to hire models, but it had been Blaise who had said; “Don’t be an idiot.  You were the most famous party boy of the nineties, and you’re still hot as hell.  Put money in the production values and model them yourself.”  It had been a master stroke; the first line sold out in weeks, the second in days.  By his third season, his sexy pajamas and underwear were the ‘show to see’ at Paris Fashion week, and he was being featured in every wizard fashion magazine in Europe.  He was now wealthy in his own right, and paid back the loan.  With interest.</p><p>He was returning to Malfoy Manor a very different man than the scared eighteen-year-old who had first escaped, his father’s epithets ringing in his ears.  So why was it, he wondered in irritation, that his hands were still sweating and his heart pounding?  And why in the world had he come at all?  His mother’s note had been cryptic, at best. </p><p>
  <i>“Please, please come home, son.  Please.  It’s very urgent.”</i>
</p><p>That was it.  </p><p>And yet, for Narcissa Malfoy to use the word ‘please’ three times in ten words?  Try as he might, he hadn’t been able to ignore it. He had issues with his mother’s non-involvement in his father’s parenting technique, but he couldn’t ignore her plea.  Thus, he found himself standing before the gates, trying to summon the intestinal fortitude to ring the ruddy bell.</p><p>In the final analysis, the decision was taken from his hands.</p><p>“Welcome home, young Master,” a deep voice intoned, and the massive gates swung open silently. </p><p>It was not a long walk up the drive, but his anxiety grew with each step.  What the hell was he doing here?  This was the site of his worst nightmares, and he was walking back into it of his own free will.  He might as well check himself back into the psyche ward and be done with it, for this was madness.</p><p>The increasingly frantic thoughts spun to a silence when he looked up as he approached the pillared portico and saw the immense black doors swing open.  She stepped into the resulting space, her white-blond hair gleaming in the weak morning sun and her lovely face a mask of poorly concealed joy, and he was twelve years old, home from Hogwarts for Christmas hols, waiting to run into his Mummy’s arms.  </p><p>He didn’t run, but when she lifted her arms to pull him to her, he went gladly, and held her for a long time. </p><p>“Oh, look at you!”  She stepped back, her voice trembling, looking up into his face.  When had his mother gotten so short, he wondered.  She’d always seemed a larger than life presence to him.  But she was diminutive, of both height and stature. Her pale blue eyes were glistening with unshed tears.  “Look at you, you’re so handsome!”</p><p>“And you are still the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen,” he answered, but it wasn’t true.  She was still handsome, but where Narcissa Malfoy had once been almost ethereal in her beauty, the years had not been kind.  She looked wan, and Draco felt renewed concern on looking at her.  Something was wrong, very wrong. </p><p>“You are an elegant liar, my dear,” she said.  “But I love you for that.  Oh, come in!  It’s too cold to linger outside.”</p><p>He stepped into the massive foyer, which looked completely unchanged.  The marble floor gleamed darkly, the chandelier far overhead sparkled.  There was a vase of white roses on a table, and he couldn’t remember a time when there hadn’t been.  White roses; the flower that adorned the Malfoy Family Crest.</p><p>There was a house-elf standing just inside, and he watched Draco with huge, glowing eyes.  </p><p>“Winston,” Draco said with muted pleasure, fixing a smirk on his face.  “Not dead yet, then?”</p><p>“I’ll outlive you,” the little creature said with a matching smirk, then bowed. “Young Master.”</p><p>“Nasty midget,” Draco replied, but he smiled as he handed him his gloves.  His relationship with Winston had lasted the whole of his life, and the elf had been his early warning system of his father’s displeasure in his youth, saving Draco any number of beatings.  “It’s good to see you,” he added under his breath, and Winston averted his huge eyes as he accepted gloves and overcoat.</p><p>“And you, sir,” he murmured before Apparating away.  </p><p>“Oh, what a lovely set of robes,” his mother sighed, touching the embroidered design of frost trails across his chest.  </p><p>“I had them made at Collette’s,” he answered, knowing his mother would appreciate the mention of her favorite couturier in Paris.  She had once had many a gown commissioned there.</p><p>“How is Collette?” she asked wistfully.  </p><p>“Still a complete bitch,” he answered wryly.  “Brilliant, but a bitch.”</p><p>His mother’s laugh was musical.  “Some things never change.”  She slipped her arm through his and directed him toward one of the wide doors.  “I’ve had tea set in the sitting room.”</p><p>He allowed himself to be led into his mother’s small personal parlor, which was also unchanged.  It was as if time had stopped in the great house, while the world went on outside of it.  They drank their tea, ate their little sandwiches, made small talk until the pot was empty and the plates devoid of all but crumbs, and Draco had reached the end of his patience. </p><p>“Mother,” he said when there was a lull in the conversation that began to grow uncomfortable.  “Why am I here?”</p><p>Narcissa blinked and looked away, crimson blooming across her cheeks.  “Isn’t it enough that I wanted to see you?”</p><p>“If you’d merely wanted to see me, you could have come to Paris at any time,” he reprimanded gently.  “You know where I’ve been.” She plucked nervously at the sleeve of her dark blue robes, but didn’t respond.  “Your note said it was urgent,” he persisted. “That is why I’m here.  You know I’d not have stepped foot in this house again but for the inference that something was wrong.  Please don’t insult my intelligence by making further small talk.”  He paused when pain flitted across her face.  “What is it, Mother?  Where is Father?” </p><p>It was the elephant in the room, the one area of discussion that had not arisen.  An odd ache started in the center of his chest at the thought that in his sarcasm, he might have been right.  Was he…</p><p>“Is he dead?” he asked flatly, refusing to show any of the emotion he was feeling to his mother.  He could not even put a name to what he felt when she slowly shook her head.  Relief?  Disappointment?  An odd commingling of both?</p><p>“No, not…”  She paused, then pushed herself to her feet, looking down at him.  “Will you come with me, please?”</p><p>The odd, almost formal nature of the request made him frown, but he stood.  When she left the room, he followed, mystified when she seemed to be leading him to the back of the house.  The only thing out here was the day porch.  A pleasant room in the spring and early summer, in the winter the only thing it provided was a view of gardens that had been meticulously prepared for winter, barren at best.  As it hadn’t snowed yet, there wasn’t even a winter scene to recommend it.  He was still confused, until his mother stopped in the doorway and he lingered beside her.</p><p>There was a single large chair facing the windows, and seated in it was his father.  Or, what had once been his father.  This man was all but unrecognizable to him.  </p><p>His long hair looked lifeless and dull, now white, not blond.  It hung past stooped shoulders, bracketed a face that was expressionless and old.  The skin seemed to sag, its color ashen, unhealthy.  Hands gripped the arm rests of the chair, so skeletal that each bone was visible beneath the thin skin, and the black velvet robes did little to hide how emaciated the once powerful frame was.  Draco instinctively took a step back, and his boot clicked on the tile beneath his foot.  He held his breath when his father’s head slowly turned.</p><p>He looked right at Draco.  No, he amended.  He looked right <i>through</i> Draco, as if he weren’t standing there at all.  There was no recognition in his sunken eyes, no life.  The slate grey that had once crackled with life held… nothing. Until they moved past Draco and settled on Narcissa.  And then a caricature of his old smile appeared.</p><p>“Ah, darling,” he said, his voice as raspy.  “I was just going to fetch you.  Come,” he held out one gnarled hand and she moved to him, taking it in both of hers.  Draco felt a wave of revulsion course over him; he didn’t think he could touch him if he tried.  </p><p>“Yes, my love,” she whispered, her voice soft.  </p><p>“Look.  Aren’t the roses beautiful?  You were so right to plant the climbers over the arbors.  They are quite stunning.  Perhaps we should dine alfresco this evening, yes?”</p><p>Draco frowned, staring at the bare, lifeless vines that circled the pillars and crisscrossed over the tops of the arbors.  He knew that in spring and summer his mother’s roses were a veritable wonder, but now?  There were no roses.  All was dormant, hibernating, waiting for the snow.  Dine outside? It was freezing.</p><p>“It might be a little chilly to dine outdoors this evening, darling,” Narcissa answered, finding Draco’s eyes over his father’s head. Tears filled hers. </p><p>“Nonsense, my dear,” Lucius replied, his gaze going back to the windows.  “A light wrap will be fine.  It’s a glorious day.  And think how the perfume will fill the air.”  He lifted her hands and pressed his lips to the back of one.</p><p>“Lucius,” Narcissa said softly, extricating one hand from his grip and reaching up to gently stroke his hair.  “Draco is here.  He’s come to visit, darling.  Isn’t that wonderful?”</p><p>Draco stiffened, waiting. Lucius looked up at her for a moment, the soft pleasure Draco had seen on his face fading until there was no expression left. He turned his eyes back to the windows, and when he spoke, his voice was leaden. </p><p>“Next spring, you should plant clematis in with the roses,” he murmured.  “Think how stunning that would be… the purple… and the white…”  his voice trailed off, and as Draco watched he laid his head against the back of the chair and appeared to simply go to sleep.  Narcissa lifted the heavy blanket that was over his legs and gently tucked it in around his shoulders.</p><p>Draco didn’t know what to think.  He watched her fuss over Lucius for another moment, then returned to him, back ramrod straight and chin lifted.  They were back in the entrance hall before he spoke.</p><p>“How long?” he asked.  She turned, her hands gripped tightly in front at her waist, one brow raised.  “How long has he been like this?”</p><p>She swallowed before she spoke.  “There had been… signs that something wasn’t right almost from the moment he came home from Azkaban.  We were able to hide it during the war; the Dark Lord had lost interest in us for anything other than a place to stay, so there were no missions to be sent on.”</p><p>“I was here, then,” Draco said, his brow furrowing.  “He seemed… fine.”</p><p>But had he really, he wondered now.  His father had always been supremely self-possessed, and yet when he’d been freed from Azkaban, he had seemed different.  More vicious, quicker to anger.  Draco had chalked it up to the strains of his imprisonment and the stresses of the war, but had it been something else?</p><p>“He wasn’t,” Narcissa said.  “It started with small things; he’d forget where he put his cane, or his shoes.  I didn’t think much of it, at first.”  She paused as if collecting herself before she went on.  “After the war, it progressed.  He couldn’t remember what day it was, or what he was supposed to be doing.  He was so frustrated; so angry.”</p><p>“The anger I remember,” Draco muttered.  Narcissa’s answering expression was sad.</p><p>“You two always brought out the worst in each other,” she murmured.  “He was too exacting, you too independent.  And he didn’t want you to know what was happening; he was so afraid that you’d lose respect for him…”</p><p>“My loss of respect for him had nothing to do with his fits of temper,” Draco said.  Narcissa flinched and Draco sighed.  He didn’t want to hurt his mother. “I’m assuming he’s seen a Healer,” he said more gently.</p><p>She nodded.  “They think it’s spell damage,” she murmured.  “The Dark Lord was so angry about the lost prophecy.  He held your father under the Cruciatus for hours those first days after he was released.  I feared he’d kill him.”  She shook her head.  “It might have been kinder if he had.”</p><p>“Is this why you brought me here today?” he asked.  “Clearly, he can no longer manage the estate.  Do you need help?”</p><p>“I can manage the estate, Draco,” she answered, her posture stiffening.  “That isn’t why you’re here.  Yes, I felt it time that you understood what was going on with your father.  I had hoped it might… soften you towards him a bit, but…”  She stopped, and shook her fair head.  “I suppose I hadn’t reckoned on how deeply your hurt went.”  When he started to argue that he wasn’t hurt, just bloody infuriated, she held up her hand. “There is, however, the actual reason I asked you to come.”  She turned and walked away from him, her back rigid, the instruction that he follow her implicit.  He sighed, but went after her.</p><p>They took a circuitous route, but he recognized when they entered the family wing of the house.  When she went to a door that he knew contained all of the old family records, he frowned but followed.</p><p>He’d only been in the room a few times as a child; he’d been fascinated by the tapestry that covered three walls.  It showed a midnight blue sky, diamonds of varying sizes fixed into the fabric like fanciful constellations.  His mother had told him once that the Black Family tapestry depicted a ‘family tree’, but she found this recording of the Malfoy generations far more beautiful.  He loved to stare at it, occasionally seeing a shooting star as it raced across the woven heavens.  It seemed a wondrous thing, his own name a small constellation just beneath his parents.  Instinctively, his eyes sought it, and he was surprisingly gratified to see that it was still intact.  His father had once delighted in telling him how his Aunt Walburga had blasted away the names of family members she’d had a falling out with in the Black family tree.  He was about to ask his mother why she’d brought him there, when he noticed that, while his own name was still there, sparkling in a far corner, there did seem to be a difference.  His had been the only name that low on the tapestry; Malfoy’s were not prolific.  His grandfather had been an only son, as had his father, and he was an only son.  So what…?</p><p>He took a step closer, his eyes narrowed.</p><p>Just beneath his name was another small group of diamonds, and at the center were the words ‘Boy Malfoy, b. 2003’.   </p><p>Boy Malfoy?  Boy… what?</p><p>“I see you’ve noticed the addition,” his mother said from nearby, and Draco whirled on her.  She was staring at him, her face impassive.  “I never come in here. I doubt I’d have ever seen it if I hadn’t been searching for some records for estate business.  I was seated behind the desk, just there,” she gestured with her hand to a small secretary in a corner, “when a ray of sunlight caught on the diamonds.  I supposed because they are so much brighter than the older ones.”  Her eyes drifted back to the tapestry.  </p><p>“I don’t… that is…”  Draco stopped, then roughly cleared his throat.  “Obviously, there’s been some sort of mistake.”</p><p>Narcissa shot him a look.  “There is no mistake, Draco.  This is an ancient object directly tied to the Malfoy line, full of powerful enchantments.  The Manor, and all heirlooms inside of it, know instantly when another Malfoy has been born and automatically key all of the wards to accept that heir instantly.”  She turned to face him, her arms crossed.  “I assume from your reaction that you had no idea that you’d fathered a son?  You’ve spread your seed around rather notoriously, my dear.”</p><p>It was one thing to fuck half of wizard Europe; it was another to hear his mother put it that way in her oh-so-proper tone of voice.  He hated that he was blushing.</p><p>“I’m no monk,” he retorted, and her brow arched again in irony.  “But,” he went on, “as you know so well from the battle royale that drove me from this place to begin with, I prefer <i>men</i>, who even in wizarding circles, don’t breed.”</p><p>“So, there’s never been a woman?” his mother asked archly.  “Never?”</p><p>Draco started to deny it, then went still as a vague memory surfaced. </p><p>He’d been in Monaco, with Blaise.  They’d been gambling and drinking, euphoria potions liberally spiking the wine, when Blaise had come up to him, a sly smirk on his face and a young woman on his arm. She’d been pretty, but no more than a girl, really.  Blaise had introduced them… he’d known the family…  He turned towards the large window near his mother’s secretary, staring out at the darkened afternoon but not really seeing it. He’d been in school with her sister… Greengrass!  That was it; Daphne Greengrass’s little sister, Astoria.</p><p>
  <i>He greeted the girl with negligence, and noticed the way she stared at him; hero-worship mingled with awe. He’d seen it before. She joined their table and pressed in next to him, and he found her both slightly annoying and yet amusing. </i>
</p><p>
  <i>“She has the hots for you, you know,” Blaise whispered in his ear a while later.  “Thinks you’re sex on a stick. You could have her on her back with her ankles around her ears in no time.”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Draco grimaced.  “Tempting, but no,” he drawled wryly.  “I don’t do women, remember?”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“What, not even once?” Blaise grinned.  “How do you know you won’t like it, if you don’t try it? Or are you afraid you won’t be able to get it up?”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Draco narrowed his eyes.  “I’ve no problem ‘getting it up’, as you so crudely put it.”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“So, put your money where your mouth is,” Blaise taunted. “Unless you’re scared.”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>He let the taunt dangle there, knowing that Draco would be unable to resist it.  He shot another look at the Greengrass girl, who smiled up at him in adoration, and sneered at Blaise.  </i>
</p><p>
  <i>“A hundred Galleons, to make it interesting?”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>Blaise had grinned and withdrawn a small golden vial from an interior pocket.  “Oh, I’ve got something to make it interesting.”  He spilled a few drops into Draco’s wine.  </i>
</p><p>
  <i>“What is that?” Draco asked, hesitant.</i>
</p><p>
  <i>“Just a little something to grease the wheels, as it were.” Draco had still hesitated, even when Blaise had pushed the glass into his hand.  “Have I ever steered you wrong?”</i>
</p><p>
  <i>In terms of drugs, at that point Blaise hadn’t.  Draco picked up the glass and downed its contents in one gulp.  It had burned going down…</i>
</p><p>He really didn’t remember much after that, and he’d had reason to be grateful for that over the years.  He already had enough sins on his conscience that he could remember.  He vaguely recalled taking the girl to his suite and seducing her.  Whatever Blaise had put in his drink had made him so hard it was painful, and he’d have fucked anything by the time he was inside of her.  She’d been enthusiastic if inexperienced, and he thought they’d done it twice, but there the memory ended.  </p><p>When he turned back, he found his mother studying him.  “There was… one,” he admitted carefully.  Her lips curled at the corners. </p><p>“It only takes one, darling.”</p><p>Draco turned his head at stared again at the newest Malfoy constellation.  He had a son.  Somewhere out there, he had a son.</p><p>For a moment, he thought he might be ill.</p><p>TBC</p>
