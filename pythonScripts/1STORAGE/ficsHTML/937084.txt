<p>A lot of life is dealing with your curse, dealing with the cards you were given that aren't so nice. Does it make you into a monster, or can you temper it in some way, or accept it and go in some other direction?<br/><a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/w/wescraven211055.html">Wes Craven</a> </p>

<p align="CENTER">-FBI interview, Eric Waters, April 26, 2007</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> “How did you know the suspect was Dean Winchester?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Well, I'd like, done this paper on him for my abnormal psychology class, 'cause he's, you know, a famous serial killer. So it was kind of hard not to recognize him. And I mean, he was just sitting there only one booth over. Freaked me the fuck out.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “That would be at the 'Frank's Good Eats' diner on Chalmette?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Yeah, that's the one. I'd been visiting my Mom and stopped to get a poboy on the way out. They make awesome poboys there. They use this bread, see, that's...”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “And what did you do when you spotted Mr. Winchester?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Man, what do you think? I just about pissed myself! Uh, I mean, can you take that part out?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Please just answer the question.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Well, I left, went outside I mean, and called my uncle.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “That would be Agent Delecrioux?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Yeah, that's my uncle. Anyway, he said he'd call the cops but that I should leave. On account of him being so dangerous, and all.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “And did you?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Hells yeah.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Was he with anyone? Tell me everything you observed him doing in the diner.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Just, you know, eating. Like a normal person. He was alone. 'Course, I only saw him a minute or two . I mean, when I was really paying attention. I left pretty quick after that. Did you see the pictures of those poor women in St. Louis?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Thank you, Mr. Waters. I believe we have all we need for now. We will be in touch with you.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Wait, did you catch him? Was anybody hurt?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “We'll be in touch.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="CENTER"> -End of interview-</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="CENTER">*****</p>
<p align="CENTER"> </p>
<p> Dean was enjoying the last of his cherry pie when his brother slid into the seat next to him. Sam leaned over and said quietly, “I think we've been made.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Dean put down his fork as Sam continued. “The kid that was sitting behind us is outside right now, trying really hard to look casual but he keeps looking in here. At us. And he's talking on his cell.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Shit.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Sam nodded. “The good news is I don't think he spotted me.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Dean snorted. “Why am I not surprised? Shrimp like you is easy to miss.” He ignored the glare Sam sent his way. It looked even funnier on his geeky face now than it did when he was all freakishly ginormous.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Very funny. Don't you think we'd better get the hell out of here instead of wasting time picking on me?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Dean put the last bite of pie into his mouth and stood up, carefully not looking towards the front of the diner.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “He gone yet?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Sam got up and walked over to the glass door. “Looks like. Let's go.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Dean tossed a twenty down on the table and headed for the door. “After you, little brother.” He held the door open.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Sam huffed past him. “You know, you're getting way too much enjoyment from this whole thing. We don't have time to deal with this.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Dean hurried to the Impala and unlocked his door, reaching over to unlock the passenger side from the inside. “I don't know, Sammy, this kinda feels like poetic justice to me.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Sam climbed into the car and stared at his hands. He could barely see over the dashboard. This really sucked. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Just drive, jerk.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Which way, bitch?”, Dean retorted, even as he pulled smoothly out onto the roadway.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Sam gingerly pulled a local road map out of the glove compartment. “Quickest way out of town is the 1-10 west, towards Baton Rouge.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Dean shook his head even as he scanned the area for approaching police cars. “That would be the first place I'd look for me if I were a cop, dude. How about south?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Sam consulted the map. “We could take the 90 down towards Morgan City.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Sounds like a plan. Which way?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Sam gave directions while Dean drove, weaving carefully in and out of the heavy rush hour traffic. They had just left the city limits when Sam spotted the flashing red and blue lights.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Dean.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p> “I see them.” They rounded a corner and saw more than just lights. It was a roadblock, made up of what looked like every available cop in the area. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Shit!” Dean exclaimed. He took his foot off the gas and lightly tapped the brake so that they were effectively coasting. Neither doubted this was all in place to catch them. “Maybe we can make a run for it.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Sam turned his whole body around and got up on his knees, looking behind them. “I don't think so, Dean.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Dean turned around in his seat. At least five cars had pulled out from hiding spots behind them to flank them from the rear.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Now what?” Sam whispered. Dean bit his lip as he thought.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Okay, look, you gotta play the victim.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Sam looked at him incredulously.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “It's the only thing that makes sense. They'll never believe that you're you. They're gonna think you're just some kid that I've taken. You need to go along with that. If you tell them the truth, they're just going to send you to the nuthouse. This way, it'll be easy for you to give them the slip.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Sam frowned but nodded. For once, Dean's reasoning was flawless. “What about you?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Dean shrugged. “We'll work that out when the time comes. At least one of us will be free. I don't think we have a lot of choices here, Sammy.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Dean was right. They had by now coasted to a stop near the formidable line of various law enforcement vehicles, each one flanked by an armed officer with his weapon drawn and trained on them. Through a bullhorn they heard, “Lay down your weapons and step out of the car!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> The brothers looked at each other. Dean removed the gun hidden under his shirt and carefully slid it under the front seat. He looked at his brother. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> “What? I'm not carrying, Dean. I'm in the body of a kid, for God's sake!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Lay down your weapons and step out of the car, <em>now</em>!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> In unison they opened their respective doors and stepped out of the car. Dean put his hands on his head anticipating the next order. Sam concentrated on looking small and lost.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="CENTER">*****</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="CENTER">Two months earlier, Zachary, Louisiana</p>
<p> </p>
<p> They were almost down to the grave, a Miss Amy Bancroft buried in 1896 after dying of supposedly natural causes. In actuality, she'd died after being poisoned by a jealous and undoubtedly unhinged stepmother. Amy had been taking her revenge on various family members and their descendants ever since.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> It was Dean's turn to dig. Sam was standing guard, his shotgun loaded with rock salt at the ready.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Sam spotted it first out of the corner of his eyes, a flash of white in the dim moonlight of the cemetery. He swiveled, gun pointed at the potential threat.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Dean.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Dean's head popped up. “Trouble?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Sam jerked his head at the object in the distance. “You tell me.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Dean's forehead creased in confusion. “What the hell?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Don't know, dude. Just finish up, fast.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Dean nodded without answering and resumed shoveling with a renewed urgency.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Sam studied the object floating near a headstone. It looked like nothing he'd ever seen before. A ball of milky mist a little bigger than a basketball, it had a long thin trail of white beneath it. Almost like a tail. Sam had the unsettling feeling it was observing him, studying him. Suddenly it began moving at a high rate of speed towards him. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> “ETA Dean!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Three minutes!” Dean called from inside the grave.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Sam fired the shotgun in the center of the creature. It dissipated into nothingness. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Sam?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Okay for now, just finish it.” Dean grunted an assent. From below him Sam heard the sound of ancient wood being pried open. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Little help here.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Keeping his eyes up and focused on the area in which the mist had materialized, Sam reached down to help his brother out of the grave. He stood guard while Dean poured the fuel and threw a match into the grave. Both men stood tensely waiting for a reappearance of the spirit. After several long minutes of waiting they began to relax.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Think we got it.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Dean nodded. “You think it was her?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Sam shrugged. “I guess. Never saw a spirit apparate like that before though. If it was, she should be gone now.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Dean's eyes continued to scan their immediate environment, his brow creased in concentration.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Dean, c'mon, let's go before someone calls this in. Or do you really feel like spending the night in jail?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Sam was bending over to retrieve the shovel when it happened. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Without warning the object reappeared, this time completely enveloping Sam. His body jerked like a fish on a hook.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Sam!” Dean yelled and raised his weapon but stopped before firing. There was nothing to aim at that wouldn't hit his brother as well. Suddenly Sam seemed to lose consciousness, eyes rolling back in his head and his mouth open slightly. He remained standing. This did not look good.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Dean swore. Rock salt would hurt like a bitch and leave some nasty bruises but it would get that thing off Sam. He fired at Sam's chest, unwilling to risk a direct hit to his eyes. The object disappeared and Sam collapsed onto the dew dampened grass. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Swearing, Dean grabbed his brother up into his arms and ran for the car. It was only as he was shoving him into the back seat that the adrenaline wore off enough for him to process the fact that he shouldn't have been able to do that. It had, in fact, been more years than Dean like to think about since Sam had been small enough for him to carry. He stopped and stared at the person in his car. At the inexplicably<em> young</em> person in his car.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Sam?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Sam's eyes fluttered open. “Dean? What happened? You get it?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Dean rubbed his hand across his eyes. “Yeah, but we got bigger problems.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Sam sat up on his elbows. “What?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “You're a kid, dude.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Sam sat up fully, then maneuvered himself to see his reflection in the rear view mirror. Dean saw his eyes grow large. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Dean, I'm a kid!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Dean rolled his eyes. “Think that's what I just said, Sammy.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Don't call me Sammy, jerk.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Dean laughed, genuine humor mixed with a tinge of hysteria. “You've never been more of a Sammy, dude.” He noticed the tiny drops of blood on Sam's arms and instantly sobered up. “Damn, Sammy, sorry I had to shoot you. Doesn't look too bad though. Looks like your arms and hands got the worst of it.” He leaned over the front seat to grab some paper napkins and hand them to Sam. “Better get you back to the hotel and get this bandaged up.” Sam took the napkins and nodded as he dropped his head back down onto the seat. Sometimes his life was really weird.</p>
<p> Dean walked in holding a greasy bag of burgers aloft triumphantly. “Dinner is served!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Sam looked up from his laptop, grinning. “I think I found it Dean! Look, it's a hitodama, found in Japanese mythology. There's a similar creature found in European lore. Not a whole lot of info on it but it's a step in the right the direction.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Dean put the burgers down on the table next to the motel window and sat down next to Sam on the bed. He peered at the screen. “So what's their deal?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “They appear in graveyards following a recent death. Apparently they like to mislead those who see them. Dama's <strong>Compendium </strong>says it sometimes 'plays pranks on travelers or misleads them in some way and is attracted by those with strong karma'.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Dean waved a hand at Sam's small frame. “How do you figure this is misleading us?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Sam shrugged. “You interrupted it. Who knows what it was really trying to do. But even so, this is pretty messed up. I think maybe it's like a trickster sort of thing, where it's basically just screwing with you. Only I don't think it's really sentient.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “So how do we undo this? Not that having baby Sam back hasn't been barrels of fun.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Sam shrugged again. “No clue. Everything I've found so far has said there is no reversing whatever it does.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Dean eyed him with suspicion. “I gotta say, Sammy, you're being awfully laid back about all this. Why aren't you freaking out?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “I am, a little bit. Or I was. But really, it's not that bad. I mean, it could be worse. So I've lost a few years. I'll grow up again.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Dean rolled his eyes. “I forgot who I was talking to. Since you're halfway to monkhood already, I guess spending the next few years without sex or booze isn't going to bother you too much. What am I supposed to say when people ask why I'm dragging a kid around with me?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Sam powered down his laptop and busied himself putting it away for the night. “Well, they'll probably think you're a either a pervert or are taking care of your little brother. It would behoove us to promote the latter.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Dean fished through the bag and pulled out a paper wrapped sandwich. He tossed it in Sam's general direction. “And that kind of talk is exactly why you don't get laid, Sammy.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p> He stopped and made a face as the words, spoken automatically, permeated his consciousness. “On second thought, forget I said that. This is gonna be weird, dude. Big you in little you's body.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Sam swallowed the bite of chicken sandwich before answering. “Tell me about it. I'm still freaking out whenever I pass a mirror. And don't get me started on, you know.” He flapped a hand in the general direction of the bathroom.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Dean grimaced around his mouthful of burger. “Dude.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Sam nodded solemnly. That pretty much summed things up. At least things could get much worse from here though, right?</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> They spent the next couple of weeks visiting various shamen, mythology professors, and voodoo priestesses in search of answers. It didn't take Sam long to spot the silver living to this particular cloud. It was actually worth the daily humiliations of being a kid again if he were able to hunt for an answer to Dean's problem under the guise of looking for a solution to his own. Of course, Dean wasn't stupid enough to believe Sam had given up on finding a way out of Dean's deal. But this way Dean was able to pretend that he believed it with perfectly plausible deniability. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Unfortunately no answers to either problem were immediately forthcoming. Bobby, laid up with a broken leg, wasn't a whole lot of help. Neither he nor any of his contacts had much info on the hitodama, though he did give Sam some direction in beginning his hunt for answers. They'd mostly been circling around the south, trying to stick close to the Gulf Coast in case they needed to do some ritual in the cemetery where Sam had been affected. They'd even knocked out a minor hunt at Dean's insistence with Sam providing mainly research and backup. It was bitter-sweetly nostalgic for them both, a reminder of days gone by. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> The day of their capture both brothers had spent the day researching in the mythology section of the University of New Orleans library. That is, Sam did. Even hampered by his damaged hands and small stature that made reaching top shelves difficult to say the least, Sam was doing the bulk of the work. Dean made a honest effort, lasting longer than Sam thought he would. But by lunch time the finger tapping and sighing had gotten so distracting he'd sent Dean out with orders not to come back before five when they'd go out to eat.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> At least Sam had been able to finish his meal before it all went to hell.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="CENTER">*****</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Agents Tom Lejeune and Adam Fuller were almost to the roadblock when the call came through. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Did you get them?”, Agent Fuller asked after the caller identified himself. “Were both brothers there?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Nope, just the one you said would be there for sure. The older one, Dean. But get this, he had a hostage. A kid.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “What happened? Is the kid okay?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “His hands are kind of banged up but otherwise he looks to be fine. He won't say what happened. Good news is, nothing happened to him at the roadblock, Winchester gave up without a fight.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Odd. Fuller would have expected Winchester to put up some resistance. Then again from what he'd read so far in Hendricksons files, which wasn't much admittedly since he'd only had the car ride to read, the guy was a cockroach of a survivor. Faced with a checkmate scenario it would make sense for him to surrender and wait for a chance to escape later. Like most sociopaths, he would be solely concerned with his continued existence. Although he had apparently made at least one significant connection to another human being in the course of his miserable life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “No sign of the brother?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Nope.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Who is the kid?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “No idea, he's not talking at all. Not a peep.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “How old would you say he is?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Eleven, maybe twelve would be my guess.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> At least he was physically capable of talking. A really young child would have been useless as a witness. It made him sick to think of a psycho like Winchester having a child under his control for any length of time but maybe something good could come of it. According to Hendrickson's notes, Winchester was incapable of keeping his mouth shut for any length of time. He would have undoubtedly told the kid some things he shouldn't have. Fuller was nothing if not a silver lining kind of guy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “We're almost there, just keep him calm until then. And for God's sake, don't take your eyes off Winchester for a second. He's escaped custody three times that we know of and has no problem killing cops to do it. Weapons drawn until we get there.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Roger that.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Fuller hung up and looked at his partner. “You get all that?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “He had a kid with him? A hostage?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Apparently.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Damn.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Fuller agreed wholeheartedly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Winchester was handcuffed, hands in back he noted, and circled by at least ten officers, most with weapons drawn. Fuller approved. He'd apparently impressed on them the seriousness of the danger Winchester represented. Of course, most of them would have seen the news reports themselves. It wasn't everyday that an entire police station blows up, taking with it several LEOs and civilians, not to mention two federal agents. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Supposedly Dean and his brother had died as well, although well before the explosion. But it wouldn't be the first time the older one, at least, had managed to somehow fake his own death. Fuller wondered if the younger one, Sam, had in fact died after all. From what he knew they worked as a team, though the role of each was hotly debated. Hendrickson had seemed to believe the older one was the main instigator, following his father's dark path blindly. He thought Sam had tried to leave his family's criminal ways behind him but was pulled back in by his brother after Dean murdered his girlfriend. Fuller wasn't so sure. To him it seemed just as likely that Sam was every bit the murdering psychopath his brother was, just better at concealing it. It was even possible Sam had taken on their missing father's role in the family and was responsible for choosing their crimes and victims.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> The crowd parted to let the agents through. An older man wearing a sheriffs uniform approached them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Agents Lejeune and Fuller?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Fuller extended a hand. “Pleasure, sheriff. Any problems?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> The Sheriff wiped his hand on his uniform before taking Fuller's. “Nope. Guess even a rat bastard like Winchester knows when he's beat.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Winchester smirked at that but remained silent. Hopefully that was only temporary.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Who was it that spotted them?” Lejeune put in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Sheriff Landry pointed towards a tall man standing off to one side. “Boyd over there. One of my deputies. He was off duty but still had his scanner on, caught the APB just before Winchester cruised past him.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Lejeune nodded. “Think I'll go thank him.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Fuller watched him leave before turning back to the sheriff. “Where's the kid?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> The Sheriff gestured in the direction of a state highway patrol car, sitting over to the side of the road with one rear door open. Fuller could just make out small sneaker clad feet dangling below the door. He walked in that direction.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Wide brown eyes met his from underneath floppy bangs before looking back down at the asphalt. Fuller stopped awkwardly. He barely knew how to talk to a normal kid, much less a traumatized one. Luckily Lejeune joined them fairly quickly. Fuller stepped back to let his partner take the lead. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Lejeune squatted down on his haunches. “Hey, there, <em>mon ami</em>, how's it going? My name is Tom Lejeune and this is my partner Adam Fuller. We work for the FBI. Can you tell me your name?” The kid pulled his feet inside the car and focused his gaze on the gray carpeted floor of the patrol car. There was no answer.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Things are kind of scary right now, huh? We just need to know who your parents are and then we can get you home. I'll bet your mom and dad are real worried about you by now.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p> The kid looked up at them then and man, did he looked terrified. A litany of horrors that may have been perpetrated against this child ran through Fuller's head.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Can you at least tell me what happened to your hands? It's okay to talk to us, the man who took you can't do anything to you anymore. We've got him in custody. He's going to be locked away forever so he can never hurt anyone ever again.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> The boy swallowed and looked down again. Fuller had the distinct impression he wouldn't be talking any time soon. He most likely wouldn't feel safe from Winchester for a while yet.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Lejeune. Let's get him back to headquarters, we can talk there.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Lejeune nodded. He knew as well as Fuller that they would have taken the kid back for an interview at any rate, but it would have been nice to let frantic parents know their child was alive. It would have to wait until the boy felt safe enough to talk.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Yeah. Okay, we need you to come with us now.” Lejeune held his hand out but didn't touch the boy. After a long moment during which Fuller thought the kid was going to balk at going with them, the boy hopped out of the car. He made no move to take Special Agent Lejeune’s hand but followed behind them quietly.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Fuller asked the Sheriff to escort Winchester to FBI headquarters. Three other cars followed behind, forming a small convoy of police protection. No one was taking any chances.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Lejeune tried to engage the kid twice more on the drive back into the city but there was no response. He didn't even crack a smile at the lame attempts at jokes that most prepubescent boys would find hilarious. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Once they arrived Fuller supervised the transfer of Winchester into the building himself leaving his partner to deal with the kid.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Gotta say, Winchester, I expected more from you,” he said as he watched the prisoner being frisked and handcuffed to the interview table.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Don't believe everything you read, chief.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Fuller stepped closer, right up into his personal space. “One thing your file didn't mention was that you apparently like little boys.” He didn't have to wait long for Winchester's reaction.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “That's sick, dude!” Winchester actually had the nerve to look repulsed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Fuller smiled. Someone this easy to bait would be a snap to interrogate. Three, four days tops and he'd know all he ever wanted to know about Winchester and his twisted excuse for a family. Including where the boy had come from. And what happened to the missing brother.</p>
<p align="CENTER"> </p>
<p align="CENTER"> </p>
<p align="CENTER">*****</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Lejeune took the boy to the evidence processing section of the building. Melissa Warechek was on duty. “What have we here?” she asked, smiling at the boy. He didn't return the smile.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “This young man needs a complete workup. He's not talking right now so we aren't sure what's going on.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Melissa responded like a pro. “No problem. Can I talk to you outside for a minute?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> They stepped just outside the door, leaving it open to observe the child inside. Melissa pitched her voice low so the boy couldn't hear. “I need some background here, Tom.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p> “You remember that pair of serial killers, the Winchester brothers, supposedly killed in that explosion a few weeks back?” At her nod, he continued. “They aren't as dead as we thought. One isn't, anyway. The oldest, Dean. He was just picked up and the kid was in his custody. We don't know anything more yet, not even the boy's name.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Melissa looked horrified. “That poor kid.” She paused. “Are we suspecting sexual assault?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “There's no history of sexual violence against children but we certainly can't rule it out. Do a standard rape exam and collect trace evidence as well.” Melissa nodded. They were both well aware that there was no such thing as too much forensic evidence when it came to prosecuting the bad guys.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Are you going to wait? It'll take about a hour or so.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Tom nodded and pulled a chair from inside the room to just outside the door. “Holler if you need me.” It wasn't an idle request. Witnesses, especially injured ones, had been known to lash out in their distress. Even a child could do damage with the right piece of medical equipment in their hands.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Melissa glanced at the boy in the room, standing unnaturally still and studying the floor. “I'll need to call Evie in to assist.” Exams were always done with two employees present to avoid accusations of evidence tampering or misconduct.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Evie arrived shortly thereafter and closed the door firmly behind her. About forty five minutes later it opened again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “We're all done. He did great.” The boy stood in the middle of the room, flushed features tightly drawn. Lejeune didn't blame the kid. He knew they tried to make the exam as easy as possible but it wasn't exactly a pleasant experience. Either Melissa or Evie had given the kid some of the spare clothes they kept for just such a case as this. The t-shirt swallowed him, coming all the way down to his knees. The bottoms appeared to be scrubs identical to the ones the tech was wearing, likely the only thing close to his size they had. They were rolled into cuffs but still dragged the floor. He looked impossibly young and out of place in the federal building.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “That's great. Could you give me a minute, <em>mon ami</em>?” He left the child waiting where he was and joined Melissa back in the lab. “Anything I need to know tonight?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “No. Nothing that required medical attention except the wounds on his hands and forearms. No idea what caused them. They may look bad but they're actually mostly healed. There's a large contusion on his back that you might want to be careful of. No sign of sexual trauma. I'll get you a full report tomorrow.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Thanks, Melisa.” He raised his voice. “Hey, why don't we go find someplace more comfortable to hang out for a while, okay?” Tom waited for the boy to exit the room and then led the way down the hallway. He took the boy to their most kid friendly interview room, the one with a sofa and armchairs. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> “So are you hungry, thirsty, maybe?” The boy shook his head no. Struck by a sudden inspiration, he rooted out some paper and pens from the small filing cabinet by the door.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “You know, if you don't want to say anything, you can always write stuff. Or just doodle. Whatever. No pressure.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> The kid was eying him as if he were a particularly slow witted child. Lejeune felt vaguely insulted.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Or not.” Out of ideas for the moment, he called for backup.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Amy, the after hours dispatcher, answered. “Hey, any luck tracking down George?” </p>
<p> </p>
<p> “He's on his way, Tom. It'll be a few, he was in Metarie at his kid's ball game. He wasn't happy about having to come in.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “He'll be all right once he gets here and sees what's up.” George Colbert was the resident psychiatrist, interviewing the trickier subjects as needed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Tom wished he would hurry. Clearly all he was doing was making the kid more nervous, not less. He settled in to wait and hoped his partner was having better luck with Winchester.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="CENTER">*****</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Fuller was in the viewing area of the interview room, reading over Winchester's file on his laptop when Lejeune came in.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “How's the kid?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> His partner studied Winchester through the glass as he answered. “I left him with George. Melissa did the evidentiary exam, no sign of sexual assault but significant bruising on his arms, hands, and back.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Any idea what caused it specifically?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Lejeune shrugged. “We're not sure. If I had to guess I'd say he was peppered with gravel on the arms. The back could be anything from a punch to a slam. He's still not talking.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Fuller rubbed his forehead and pursed his lips in response. Lejeune gestured at Winchester.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “You still letting him stew?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Fuller studied his laptop screen. “Never hurts. Besides, I need to know what I'm dealing with before I really get into it with him.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Lejeune sat down next to him and peered at the screen. “What have we got on him?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Hendrickson was pretty obsessed with the brothers. So there's a mountain of stuff here to go through. He used Sam's transcript from Stanford to backtrack the family's movements. Of which there were many. They didn't appear to have stayed in one place more than a few months at the outside. Usually less.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “The brothers never had a chance to become socialized outside their family. No significant connections.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Yup. Not sure if that was by design. There's no good reading on the father, of what drove him. Hendrickson thought he was a white supremacist or something along those lines. I'm thinking not. Seems more like a psychotic break. There are reports from classmates and neighbors in three separate towns who overheard the boys talking about hunting monsters.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Sounds like kids playing pretend to me.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “I think not. When they were interviewed about the brothers and asked what they remembered about them, this is what they talked about. Well, that and them having weapons around a lot. Guns, knives, you name it.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “So you think the father started all this, killing people he thought were monsters, teaching his kids to do the same thing? Brainwashing them, making the boys believe in his delusions?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Looks that way. We've got CPS reports from six seperate states about the boys being abused or neglected. And the father told his former business partner 'something' had killed his wife. That it wasn't an accidental fire as ruled by the authorities. In several of the towns that the family lived in there was a string of unexplained deaths in the area. The father was never charged with anything other than petty stuff, mostly vandalism, but still. Quite a coincidence. And get this, did you know the younger son's girlfriend also died in a fire, exactly twenty two years later? To the day.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Lejeune leaned back. “No way that's a coincidence. You think it was the older or the younger one who did it?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Hendrickson seemed pretty sure it was the older brother, doing it to pull the other one back into the family business. No history of domestic violence between Sam and the girlfriend, then she's dead within three days of meeting Dean.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “That business being... hunting monsters. Or rather, people he told the kids were monsters.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Bingo.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Wow. That's <em>beaucoup</em> kinds of crazy. So what can we pin on him.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Well, there's literally dozens of credit card scams taking place all over the country, along with various mail frauds. Three confirmed dead in St Louis along with one assault victim that lived. Then there's the bank robbery. Three dead there, though one was most likely an accomplice. Plus a whole mess of minor offenses all over. Some B&amp;E's, stuff like that. But I feel sure this is just the tip of the iceberg. We've already got leads to cases the brothers may have been involved in just from Hendrickson's notes. It's possible they started killing as teenagers.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Didn't they get caught up on a B&amp;E? A museum or something?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Fuller nodded. “Yup. Broke out too, in less than a week. Just a county jail, but still.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “And then there's Colorado.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Colorado’s a whole 'nother kettle of fish. We're going to have to go over the evidence with a fine toothed comb if we want to pin any of that on Winchester. It's already been ruled an accident by our people. But if we can pin it on him that's another ten dead.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “Any ideas on the other brother? Sam?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Fuller leaned back in his chair and rubbed his eyes. “There are three main possibilities. One, Dean killed him. Two, Sam left on his own. Or maybe he just died in Colorado like everyone thought.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Lejeune grunted. It was entirely possible they'd rigged the whole thing and Sam had gotten caught in his own trap. He, among others at the bureau, thought the gas line explosion had been a little too convenient when it had happened, especially considering who was in custody at the time. A pair of serial killers, smart and capable, would have no qualms about killing a building full of people to facilitate their escape. The problem would be in proving it. There was a chance that the forensics team sent to sift through the rubble afterwards missed something, but in reality, it wasn't that likely. Their best chance to convict lay in getting a confession.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “How long have we got before extradition?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Fuller shrugged. “Missouri and Wisconsin have the best shot at it. But there are plenty of other contenders. I'm guessing it'll be tied up in the courts for a couple of weeks. Maybe more. Our lawyers will make a case for us to have him while we investigate the Colorado explosion.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> They looked at their prisoner through the two way glass. He was leaning back in the uncomfortable metal chair as far as his cuffs would allow him, the picture of relaxation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “I don't think it's working.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Fuller shook his head. “He's not as cool as he seems. Look under the table.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Lejeune leaned forward for a better look. Sure enough, Winchester's right foot was tapping out a rapid beat, releasing the nervous energy he was trying so hard to hide. Lejeune grinned. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> “<em>Ca c’est bon!</em> You wanna go first or should I?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Fuller checked his watch. “I'll do it. You need to get back to the kid, settle him in for the night.” He laughed at Lejeune's disgruntled face. “Hey, it's not my fault that you're good with kids. And you know procedure as well as I do.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Lejeune snorted. “Fine.” Of course it was important for a witness to establish trust with them and the best way to do that was to have one person be his handler as much as possible. It wasn't fair that it was usually him though. He wanted a crack at the big bad serial killer too.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> He stood up and left the room. “If you need me I'll be babysitting.” Fuller's tired chuckle followed him down the hall, cutting off abruptly as the door swung shut behind him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p align="CENTER">*****</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Sam studied the man sitting the chair across from him. Tall and rangy, he didn't really look much like a psychiatrist. At least, not what his idealized conception of what one should look like. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Sam couldn't deny his nervousness. He hadn't been sleeping well since 'The Change', as he'd taken to calling it in his mind. The sheer oddness of everything about his body being too small and proportionally all wrong had the side effect of making him restless. Restless enough to prevent him from achieving a good night's sleep. And yeah, he'd exaggerated his calmness to Dean about this dilemma, because who in their right mind wanted to go through puberty a second time? No one sane, that's who.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> So the chronic sleeplessness and the sheer intimidation factor of being in the FBI building combined with the ever hovering pressure of Dean's looming due date had his anxiety levels ramped up to such a degree that he worried about slipping up. Time was growing critically short and this all felt like a huge stumbling block to what he really needed to be doing. Saving Dean.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> The psychiatrist finally put down the folder and Sam jerked awake, startled to find himself drifting off under these circumstances. He studied Sam with piercing blue eyes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> “I can see that you are very tired. I'm sure you've had a difficult time of it lately. I want you to understand that you aren't in any trouble here. We just want to help you. How about this. Just tell me your name and we'll wait and talk again tomorrow. Can you do that for me?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> Sam's head was spinning, fatigue and the shock of waning adrenaline taking it's toll. </p>
