    <p>Louisville is a small town located in Boulder County in Colorado. Of the 18 831 people living there, 85% are white. The median household income is $84, 560 and 32.5% of the adults living in Louisville have a post-graduate degree. John knows this because Sam has been rattling it off like an audiofied Encyclopedia from the moment John told him where they are moving.</p>
<p>None of it is important, though. What is important is that it's a ten hour drive from Sioux Fall, South Dakota. If he is gone on a hunt that takes an unexpected turn, it will take Bobby Singer no more than ten hours to get to his boys. Grumbling and muttering about being irresponsible, sure, but he will come. His boys can take care of themselves for ten hours, he's made sure of that.</p>
<p>What's important is that 115 miles northwest of Louisville, at Grand Lake, there are signs of a kappa moving about, and John's promised to look into it.</p>
<p>He parks the Impala in the driveway by the house they're going to be living in for the foreseeable future. The moon is the only thing lighting it up and John makes a mental note to tell Dean to buy some lightbulbs for the busted garage lamp.</p>
<p>The boys have fallen asleep and Sam is snoring something horrible. In this cold shine, even squinting, John can't make out if his face is still flushed from the fever he's been running since Blue Earth, Minnesota. He cuts the engine and heads over to the door. He would have stopped, checked them into a motel so Sam could rest, but…</p>
<p>Making his normal sweep of the area he notices nothing more unusual than a dead rat lying in the basement. When he gets back to the car, Dean has just begun stirring awake and John puts a hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>"Son, why don't you take your bag inside? I'll be right behind you with your brother."</p>
<p>Dean yawns and slings both his and Sam's duffel over his shoulders and heads inside. John opens the back door and clicks off Sam's seatbelt. Sam doesn't even twitch and John feels a thrill of worry run through him. He could be a threat. Sam could so easily be taken from him in an unwatched moment. He isn't worried about Dean in the same way; he has a knack of pulling through, usually with a tight grip on his brother. He swipes Sam up and marvels that he still can. He should up the muscle building exercises. No Winchester should ever be this light.</p>
<p>When John gets inside, he goes straight to the second floor where the bedrooms are. He makes note of which room Dean chose and puts Sam in the other one. As gently as he can he puts him down and tries to ignore the tug his heart makes when Sam clutches at his shirt, completely unconscious of course, but it is a long time since Sam showed any outward affection for his dad. He ruffles his hair, soaked in sweat, and feels his forehead. The fever seems on its way down but John decides to hold off leaving until it’s completely broken.</p>
<p>Sam looks like the little kid he is when he’s asleep. The venom on his tongue, the thirty two ways he can incapacitate and kill an offender and the well of information on supernatural monsters – completely quiet in the night.</p>
<p>Later, when he goes back to check on the boys one last time before hitting the sack, he sees that Dean has snuck into Sam’s room and wrapped himself like a shield around his little brother. Buried under the covers they’re like one big lump. You can’t tell where one ends and the other begins. Something eases in John’s chest. Even if he isn’t here, Dean will always take care of Sam.</p>
<p>It really is unfair that he had to uproot them, train them, teach them to hunt the demon that took their mother, his wife, his Mary… But it will only be a few years. He’s already found several solid leads. It won’t be long now until they can go back to being a family, a real one, with a home and friends.</p>
<p>Soon, he thinks and goes to unpack his own bag.</p>
<p align="center">~*~</p>
<p>As a teacher in a small town like Louisville, Fiona knows most, if not all, students and respective parents, both currently in school, but also going back some thirty years. It means she has seen Mr. Green sneak the same smokes he now berates his son for, spoken to Mrs. Callaghan about the risk of unsafe sex and meeting her two children as they started school some ten years later, and tried to make geometry fun for going on three generations of bored Nelsons.</p>
<p>She loves her job. It’s rewarding to see kids learn new skills, but mostly it’s amazing to see them grow from scrawny youths to responsible adults. To see the occasional star shoot up and eventually leave town with a diploma and thanks streaming from their mouth. To see the mediocre ones struggle even when they don’t see the point and finally graduating with honors, getting respectable jobs and marrying. She’s a people person, she’ll admit. She can watch people walk by on the street where she sits at a café, sipping coffee and pretending to solve this week’s crosswords puzzle. For hours she’ll sit, watch their expressions and guess at their errands.</p>
<p>She also likes change, which is harder to come by in a town where the population doesn’t change more than from the occasional passing of someone’s grandpa or when the Johnson’s have their second. Which is why, she is quite thrilled when she gets a phone call from Principle Mathews telling her about the boy transferring to Louisville Middle School. He and his brother and father have just moved here, coming, apparently, from a lot of moving around the states. The unstructured environment he must have had is a travesty, but as she enquires about his grades Principle Mathews just chuckles. From a woman who’s known for her strategist and competitive head, it can’t be all too bad.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about it, Fiona. The boy’s been performing excellently. You should be glad you’re not teaching at the high school, though”, comes the cryptic reply.</p>
<p>“I take it you’ve gossiped with Principle Williamson, then?”</p>
<p>Principle Mathews tuts. “Not so much, but I did happen to overhear that the older brother has been given extra support throughout freshman year.”</p>
<p>Fiona really can’t condone the almost gleeful undertones in that voice and thanks her star she never has to worry about the PR of the school, beyond getting her students to pass. She’s not ignorant about the ongoing rivalry between the schools and knows about Principle Mathew’s feud with Principle Williamson.</p>
<p>“That said, I need you to keep an eye on our new addition to the student body. Apparently there was some talk at the old school”, Principle Mathews goes on and from her tone Fiona can only guess at the subject of those rumors. “Unstable home environment only goes so far to explain some school absences and sudden drops in performance.”</p>
<p>Fiona sucks in a breath of air. “You mean-“, and her minds is filled with pictures of abusive parents, alcoholism, malnourishment and other horror shows.</p>
<p>“No-no, nothing so outspoken. Whispers and rumors but nothing has ever been confirmed, or even been raised as a concern. The boys seem healthy enough, dressed, fed, show up on time, the lot. It might be nothing, but when they have such a scattered education profile it’s marked as risk cases and we want to keep an eye on the situation.”</p>
<p>Principle Mathews has dropped all humor from her voice and now only concern lace her words. She is an intelligent woman, let it never be said otherwise, and Fiona makes a note in the margins of her calendar for the day Sam Winchester will arrive.</p>
<p align="center">~*~</p>
<p>The kappa turns out to be a kelpie and for a while John is afraid he’s going to die. A kappa is easy; cut off the top of the head, let the fluid run out and it dies. A kelpie takes silver to the heart and when it kicks his gun out of his hand John has a moment to regret not seeing his sons again, letting his fight with Sam be the last he saw of him. When the kelpie trips, John thanks his lucky star and grabs for the gun, firing off the killing shot and scrambles to get away when the kelpie roars in rage and falls over on top of him.</p>
<p>He lies in the wet swamp, feeling his clothes soak through, just breathing. He needs to burn the body, pack up his stuff and make his way back to his car that’s parked a few miles back. A wound on his knee from when he fell is bleeding sluggishly. It’s a shame his medical kit is locked in the trunk and is no help at all. He wonders how late it is and looks up on the moon but he’s shit at reading the lunar cycle unless he’s estimating werewolf activity. Either way, his phone is a bust what with slowly sinking to the bottom of the surprisingly deep river. Much help that turned out to be.</p>
<p>He justifies lying there another three minutes before the struggle of breathing becomes too hard and gets up. He considers the trip to get to the gasoline and lighter and decides just easing the horse-like body into the swamp will be enough. Hopefully the imbruing will do the work for him. He almost takes his back out when he slowly pulls the body down the slope. Luckily, it’s a pretty steep drop or it would have been impossible.</p>
<p>By the time he’s done, he’s feeling lightheaded and the moon has disappeared. The trail back to the car is less a path and more a full on battle with the forest. She’s not used to letting strangers travel her floor and it feels like every other second a branch hits him in the face or he steps through what appears to be solid ground but turns into marshland. No quicksand, though, he’s got to be thankful for that.</p>
<p>He scratches a mosquito bite on his throat and wonders why they are awake at this hour when the sun breaks through the greenery. The light hits the dew and John is assaulted by the beauty of it. Right next to him a spider’s web, stretching the entire span between two trees, looks decorated by diamonds. He squints his eyes when the reflections become too bright. The spider in charge of the majestic web is nowhere in sight. He wonders if it’s proportionally big or if it’s just allowed to spin this large a web because there is no one here to disturb it.</p>
<p>His legs are starting to protest when he finally arrives at the fringe of the forest. His car, washed and shining in the morning light is a sight for sore eyes and he breathes out a contented sigh. He smells of sour water and wet, decaying horse and his clothes are covered in mud from boots to collar but he doesn’t care about that as he slides into the driver’s seat and drives away. All in a good day’s work.</p>
<p align="center">~*~</p>
<p>It’s a grainy Monday just like any other when Fiona unlocks the classroom, letting the stream of kids in the classroom. None the less, she scans the heads for the new arrival and isn’t disappointed when she sees a boy make his way to the back of the room, dump his bag on the table closest to the window and sit down without talking to anybody. Unsociable or just shy, she muses as she starts the lesson.</p>
<p>“Good morning, class”, she greets them and smiles when the tired chorus echoes back at her. “We’ve got a new student here today, and I’d like you all to welcome Sam Winchester.”</p>
<p>Heads swivel around to catch a look at the new guy and when Sam just stares ahead with a stone-face, she feels a little bad. Being new is never fun and, going by the school records, it’s not the first time for Sam.</p>
<p> “Why don’t you say a few words about yourself, Sam?” she asks, because really, the faster they get to know him the faster he’ll get friends and blend in.</p>
<p>Sam stands and makes the path up to the board in a few short seconds. Sam is in that phase where he’s growing quickly without leaving his muscles and fat a chance to catch up, meaning of course he’s incredibly lanky. That doesn’t appear to make a difference as he faces his crowd without blinking, feet shoulder-width apart and meets the gazes of everyone there. <em>No, </em>she thinks,<em> definitely not the first time.</em> If he tucked the arms dangling at this sides behind his back, he could pass as a soldier at ease, she muses.</p>
<p> “My name’s Sam Winchester. I’m from Kansas but me and my family’s been travelling a lot. I like reading and I’m decent at sports. It’s nice to meet you”, he says mechanically.</p>
<p>Fiona’s not stupid. She can hear the rehearsed words, saying just enough to get by without being asked to elaborate. She can match it up with his file that she finally received the other night. He’s been followed by praise from his teachers and every PE coach has been rejoicing at the asset Sam makes to their club teams. But then again, his file isn’t thick from praise alone. There are also the transfer papers, the letters from teachers expressing concern when Sam’s shown up tired or with missed school work and the numerous permissions slips from the father when Sam has suddenly been pulled from school.</p>
<p>There is very little sound coming from the class and Fiona sends them a glare; she’s taught them better than that. Eventually Jocelyn raises her hand.</p>
<p>“Where’d you move from? Most recently, I mean”, she asks and flushes.</p>
<p>“Blue Earth, Minnesota”, is the prompt reply.</p>
<p>“You good with football?” Victor asks, and Fiona beams. As member of the football club, being asked is a great step towards being invited, despite the late admittance. “Try-outs are over but we could use a relief kicker.”</p>
<p>“I won’t be staying long enough for you to have any use of me, but thanks for the-“, Sam stumbles a bit over the words. “Invite”, he finishes lamely.</p>
<p>“How long’re you staying, then?” Henry injects and no one can mistake the simmering hostility in his voice.</p>
<p>“I dunno”, Sam shrugs. “Like I said, we move around a lot, but the when and where is kinda random.”</p>
<p>The students look displeased with this information and Fiona understands their hesitation. It’s hard to make someone feel at home when they already have half a foot out the door.</p>
<p>“I’m sure it’s not going to be for a while anyway. Why don’t you give football a try?” Fiona intervenes and Sam stares at the floor like it has done him personal offense.</p>
<p>In his defense, Victor looks equally dismayed with the turn of events. “We practice Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, after school. There’s a field right behind the school, you can’t miss it.”</p>
<p>“Sure, thanks”, Sam grinds out and moves to go and sit down.</p>
<p>Fiona, figuring they boy’s suffered enough, picks up the lesson.</p>
<p align="center">~*~</p>
<p>It’s late by the time John gets back from the bar. The air outside is chilly but he barely feels it. Between painkillers and enough alcohol to put down a horse he doesn’t feel much of anything. He fumbles with the keys, can’t figure out which one goes in the lock and curses when he drops them. The light from the crescent moon is just barely enough for him to make out the glint from the metal. His legs feel like jelly when he bends down. It’s a slow struggle to figure out which end is up and which direction to turn and he feels a deep satisfaction when he hears the clicking noise, indicating the door being unlocked.</p>
<p>Inside he can smell mold that’s never been taken care of. The carpet is stained in more places than he can see in the darkness and who the hell puts a wall-to-wall carpeting on a house in the country side? But he doesn’t care about that as long as the thin white lines in front of the windows and door remains unbroken. He lifts his feet comically high to make sure he doesn’t stray the salt, breaking the barrier. From the inside, the lock is easier, just twist and it’s done. Safe and sound inside he takes a minute to rest his head against the steel, just breathes. The stitches don’t hurt but he pretends they do so he can justify the control exercises he uses.</p>
<p>It’s October 31<sup>st</sup> and he hoped the hunt would take longer so he could have stayed busy. Instead he’s here, wasting away his time tracking a trail that has been cold since many years, stealing the childhood his sons deserve, missing out on having a family. For what? Racing around the country, butting heads with everything unnatural in the world and hoping he’ll survive this night, too. A broken laughter breaks out between his clenched teeth.</p>
<p>No, he doesn’t feel a thing.</p>
<p>Eventually he manages to lean away from the door, kicks off his boots and makes his way into the house and up the stairs. He checks in on Sam and sees the bed is empty. When he gets to Dean’s room, it’s so dark with the only working curtains that at first he thinks its’s empty, too. Then he registers the soft snuffling sound of two people breathing in their sleep. He squints over at them, waiting for his eyes to adjust and confirms Sam has snuck into Dean’s bed. He ought to have a word with him about that. Or just tell Dean to explain it to him.</p>
<p>They really are very close, he thinks. He doesn’t have any siblings but he can’t imagine this is how it would have been if he did. Sam is snuggled up against Dean, head tucked under his chin with only his too long hair visible above the sheets. Dean has an arm slung around him in a protective fashion and half his body is covering Sam’s.</p>
<p>Something painful clenches in John’s chest. Do they know? They never (ever) talk about Mary and the horrors surrounding her death. Sam is too young to remember but maybe Dean still does. Do they talk about it? Do they know why they never celebrate Halloween or do they sum it up to being too silly or morbid when they fight monsters in their everyday life?</p>
<p>A small whine breaks his reverie and as he looks on Sam wriggles, clearly distressed. Probably a nightmare. He considers waking him but his feet aren’t being cooperative and he wonders if it’s worth it to hear him bitch at him about getting drunk. He sways back and forth a little but then the decision is taken from him as Dean squeezes Sam’s body tighter to him. John’s pretty sure he’s not even awake, the action of taking care of Sammy is just pure nature to him after all these years. He wonders if he’s screwed them up for life, if he should try separating them, if they will hate him.</p>
<p>He stumbles back into his room, dropping down on the bed in a sigh of relief. The thoughts still swivel around his head when it hits the pillow. He’s thankful because they aren’t demon black or fiery red. Within moments he’s snoring.</p>
<p align="center">~*~</p>
<p>After school Fiona makes a habit of making sure everyone makes their way to where they’re going. Most students have after-school activities and there is little to worry about; they move in clusters through the corridors to their respective clubs, be it chess club, the school paper or down to the school grounds where soccer and football practices are held, or the gym where the basketball team keeps at.</p>
<p>The few students that don’t have any activities usually ride their bikes home, being the small town it is. She’s therefore a bit dumbfounded when a black monstrosity of a car screeches in on the parking lot, music coming out in a muffled drumming noise, where it executes a perfect swerve as it comes to a halt before the entrance.</p>
<p>She searches her mind for someone who can afford both the car and the attitude but comes up with a blank. The young man who steps out is handsome in the reckless sort of way with a leather jacket and dirty blond hair. She doesn’t recognize him at all.</p>
<p>That is, until she sees Sam trudging over and greeting him and she realizes this must be, she scrambles for a name only mentioned once in passing, Dean, the big brother. Dean ruffles Sam’s hair and she has to hide a smile because the scowl he receives in return would have most people back away but Dean smirks self-assuredly and says something with a relaxed smile. She can’t see Sam’s face but he must say something funny because Dean’s eyes go wide for a second before he throws his head back and laughs.</p>
<p>Sam opens the backdoor and throws his schoolbag inside before going around the car and slinks in on the passenger side. For the brief moments the door is open the bass drumming out of the vehicle transforms into rock music.</p>
<p>Dean scans the area before turning around to get in and, for just a second that seems suspended in time, their eyes meet. Fiona doesn’t think she makes any kind of expression but Dean’s face shuts down. He throws another glance around the schoolyard before he jumps back in and they are off.</p>
<p>Fiona has no idea what any of it means but something twists in her stomach.</p>
<p align="center">~*~</p>
<p>John decides they can stay a little while longer when he finds signs of a restless spirit in the next town over. He pretends he doesn’t hear Sam exhale in relief. It’s a pretty good location, central. He has a good reach and by now they boys are grown up enough to be left on their own a couple of days when he drives off.</p>
<p>He needs to get a new car, though. It’s fine when it’s just over the night, but Dean needs to be able to get around. If John calls for back-up, or if something happens to Sam and needs to be taken to hospital, or if Bobby Singer calls to have someone check out a ghoul in the next town over, or, or. John can think of a thousand scenarios that he’s been willing to ignore when it’s just one night, but with the boys getting older, he’s been taking jobs further away and the night has turned into a couple and a couple has turned into a few. It’s time.</p>
<p>While he spends a few days looking for ads on cars and gathering Intel on the restless spirit via the motel’s guest computer, he makes updates on the boys’ training regimen. Dean, of course, has been following the one he set up religiously, and doing everything he can to have Sam follow it, too, no doubt. When he takes them out to the outskirts of town where they can practice body combat without neighborly curiosity, though, he notices that Sam gets winded pretty fast. There has clearly been some slacking off.</p>
<p>“Get up, Sam!” he yells when Dean puts him face down in the ground and he doesn’t move.</p>
<p>A whine answers him and John wonders if he actually got hurt but then there is rustling and Sam slowly gets to his feet. Dean casts a worried glance his way and John frowns. A couple of minutes later, Sam’s on the ground again.</p>
<p>“Get up, Sam. Now!” He can hear Sam panting from the grass, chest expanding with heaving breaths. “Get on your feet, right this second!” he yells, starting to come over, and Sam finally crawls to his feet.</p>
<p>He crouches down in defensive position again and they start over. When it happens again, John is grinding his teeth. He walks over, hauls Sam up and shakes his shoulder.</p>
<p>“You get up, right away. You get up the second you’re down, or you’re dead. You hear me?”</p>
<p>Sam stares up at him, still breathing heavily, but he nods.</p>
<p>“A monster won’t hesitate to kill you while you’re down. If there is even an ounce of strength left in you, you get up or you die.” He waits to see if Sam is hearing him before he goes on. “Now regulate your breathing and get busy.”</p>
<p>“Yessir.”</p>
<p>They keep going but it’s clear Sam’s not really up to it and he looks over at John several times, waiting for him to call it a quits. He doesn’t. Even when Dean starts looking harassed John makes them continue.</p>
<p>“You can easily block that if you take half a step back and raise your arm like this”, he explains when Sam takes a punch to the kidney. Sam just pants and nods, bent over with his hands on his knees. “Are you listening to me? You move <em>with</em> the enemy, feel their pace, match it and then exceed it. This kind of sloppy attack can get you killed.”</p>
<p>“Yeah”, Sam says and straightens up, “I got. Sir”.</p>
<p>“Then show me.”</p>
<p>They don’t pack up and leave until the shadows are long and their stomachs growling. At the house they wash up before heading off to the nearest fast food restaurant. His boys look exhausted and are leaning on the bar disk when getting their orders. The waitress is giving them suspicious looks and John does what he can to smile reassuringly. She only looks mildly appeased.</p>
<p>“You did good work today”, he tells Sam and Dean when they are seated at the table.</p>
<p>Dean, wolfing down his burger like a starved man, looks up with hopeful eyes. Sam stubbornly just keeps eating. He’s chosen the vegetarian option and John looks at the salad with resignation. Of course he doesn’t grow if he doesn’t eat properly. He scrubs a hand over his face, suddenly tired.</p>
<p>“I know I demand a lot of you. More than any other kids you meet in school, or wherever.” Sam casts an apprehensive glance at him. “And I know it seems unfair sometimes”, John waits until Sam’s finished swallowing so he can snort derisively. “But it’s because I want you to be prepared. There are monsters out there.” Dean is looking at him intensely, he knows this already, possibly wondering if John will bring new information to the table. “There’re dark things lurking in the night and you can never let your guard down. I’m not setting up your work-out schedule because I want to torture you or because I think it’s fun. It’s because I want you to have a fighting chance.”</p>
<p>Sam looks like he has a lot to say to that but he stuffs another piece of lettuce in his mouth and keeps quiet. John is strangely relieved.</p>
<p>“That said, I’m disappointed in your lack of discipline. Today was an excellent indication of how much you’ve slacked off.” Sam chews mutinously and Dean looks down, fighting to keep still under the weight of John’s heavy gaze. “I expect to see a stark improvement, starting tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“Yessir”, they chorus.</p>
<p>John casts one more disparaging look at Sam’s salad.</p>
<p>“And that includes a meat-based diet.”</p>
<p align="center">~*~</p>
<p>During lunch hour Fiona usually eat in the teacher’s lounge with the other teachers. They discuss who has been late to class, the drollness of correcting glossary tests, the horror that is today’s understanding of grammar and who has started dating whom. Yes, the teachers gossip just as badly as the students, if not worse.</p>
<p>Today, however, Fiona didn’t bring lunch because her fridge broke down and all her groceries, including today’s clever lunchbox with codfish and potatoes, have gone bad. It’s a travesty because she uses her mother’s recipe and it is to die for. This is why she is currently lining up with the students, filling her plate with spring rolls and stir-fry while glancing around, wondering if she should sit in the dining hall or walk back to the teacher’s lounge. It’s in another building, though, and she doesn’t fancy eating lunch cold.</p>
<p>As she hands over enough bills to cover her charge she glances over and sees the new student, Sam Winchester, sitting by himself at an empty table in the back. She bites her lip. On one hand, eating alone is never fun and in school, she remembers from her own time, it is the ultimate indicator of being an outsider. On the other hand, being joined by one’s teacher might actually turn out to be the kiss of death in this situation. Then again (she’s running out of metaphorical hands) she never was one to ignore a problem. Determinedly she stomps over.</p>
<p>“Sam”, she says gently and he glances up, surprised, from his book. “Do you mind if I sit with you?”</p>
<p>He looks halfway to worried but nods all the same and packs away his book. She approves of his manners. It can’t be easy moving around so much but it appears his father hasn’t been neglectful in his up-bringing.</p>
<p>“Is anything the matter, Mrs. Davidson?”</p>
<p>“No, no, nothing at all. I rarely eat in the dining hall so I hope you don’t mind me using you as a bit of company.”</p>
<p>Sam looks doubtful for a second but drops it and takes another bite of his spring roll. She notices he’s put three sausages on his plate, as well, but has yet to touch them. It’s probably good for him to eat some more, he looks like skin and bones beneath his lumpy shirt. He isn’t wearing the school uniform, still waiting for it to arrive, she assumes. It’s tricky with sizes at his age, with how much they’re growing and everything. Still, she frowns, being the only student in casual wear doesn’t exactly pull eyes away from him.</p>
<p>“So what are you reading?” she asks and places her a napkin in her lap. It would be a shame to spill on this skirt, she’s had it for years.</p>
<p>Sam looks briefly down at the bag where he stashed the book. “It’s about myths and stuff”, he answers vaguely and she doesn’t think she’s imagining the sudden twitchiness in him.</p>
<p>“Oh? Are you interested in old legends, then, Sam?”</p>
<p>“Yeah… no, not really. Just thought it would be… fun.” His shoulders are slumped and he’s chewing like he’s counting the correct number of times. He’s definitely not smiling.</p>
<p>“Have you been to football practice yet?” she changes the subject smoothly. The spring roll is crunchy but she can’t detect any spices at all. Such a shame.</p>
<p>“Yeah, we’re mostly building muscle now, though ‘cause apparently we’re behind schedule”, Sam says and Fiona pretends she doesn’t hear when he mutters “In November”. She doesn’t really know all that much about the game but she can imagine that just doing ground work can’t be much fun.</p>
<p>“How about the teammates? Are they being nice? Have you talked to anyone, yet?”</p>
<p>“Absolutely, they’re all really cool”, Sam answers and stuffs his mouth full so he doesn’t have to elaborate. Fiona can take a hint. She can also see when someone is just feeding her lines they think she wants to hear.</p>
<p>“I know coming to a new school can be tough, connecting with someone, reaching out. Especially if you know you’re not going to be here all that long. But Sam, you can’t keep thinking none of it matters because you’ll be gone soon. You’ll miss out on so much.”</p>
<p>Sam keeps chewing and doesn’t answer. He has a faraway look on his face and Fiona suspects he might not even have heard her.</p>
<p>“You’re right, thank you Mrs. Davidson. I’ll think about it”, he says and gets up, about to leave. With the stretch of bending down to collect his tray, though, the material stretches and she notices a bruise around his wrist.</p>
<p>“Sam”, she says and something in her voice must work as a warning bell because his eyes snap to her. “What happened to your arm?”</p>
<p>“I had a wrestling match with my brother”, Sam says and laughs awkwardly. It sounds hollow. “He’s pretty big and doesn’t know his strength.”</p>
<p>“Were you on the wrestling team at your old school?” she asks and Sam takes a second to answer.</p>
<p>“My dad taught us. He was in the Marine and thought it was a good idea to teach us to handle ourselves in a fight.”</p>
<p>Fiona looks at him and Sam looks back, meeting her gaze steadily. She nods.</p>
<p>“All right, I’ll see you in class tomorrow, Sam. Take care of yourself.”</p>
<p>Children his age get bruises all the time. They live active lifestyles and it’s a sign that they’re allowed to enjoy their childhood more than anything. It’s nothing to worry about.</p>
<p align="center">~*~</p>
<p>John is researching a potential case of a skinwalker when the boys get home from school. It’s slow going and he’s considering having a second beer when they barge through the door. He casts a precursory glance at the salt lines but the boys are careful, it’s basically instinct by now.</p>
<p>“Man, I’m starving”, Dean moans and goes straight to the small kitchen.</p>
<p>There is nothing in there but half a leftover burrito and not nearly enough to feed two growing young men. He can already hear Dean’s disappointment but he doesn’t get up. If he wasn’t here they would have to deal with the situation by themselves and by all means he is working.</p>
<p>Sam pulls off his shoes and looks over at him. John ignores the tingling in his spine from being looked at from behind and flips a page in the book he borrowed from the library this morning. Sam goes to sit on the couch instead, where he pulls up his homework. Dean is rummaging through the cabinets even though he must have figured out there is nothing edible in the house by now. He gives out a long sigh and goes back out.</p>
<p>“I’ll bring us some grub”, he says as he closes the door.</p>
<p>There is a few minutes of silence where Sam scratches away on some report and John gets absolutely nowhere on the research. The tension in the room is palpable. John reads through the most recent article one more time and then gives up. Sam is the master of silences. He clears his throat. Twice.</p>
<p>“Sam”, he says and feels rather than sees Sam tense up.</p>
<p>“Sir?”</p>
<p>“Why don’t you start on your afterschool work-out while you wait for your brother to get back?”</p>
<p>Sam throws a reluctant look on his schoolwork and sighs very quietly like John won’t remark on it if he’s quiet enough.</p>
<p>“Yessir.”</p>
<p>Despite being phrased like a question they both know it’s just a peace offering. It’s an order disguised as a suggestion to avoid open confrontation. Sam can pretend his life is normal, that he has a choice in this, and John can go back to working without having another screaming contest. He’s pretty sure he never had to go through these diplomatic methods with Dean. It feels profoundly unfair.</p>
<p>When Sam’s finally dressed and out the door, John decides to have that beer after all.</p>
<p align="center">~*~</p>
<p>It’s a Wednesday afternoon when Fiona gets the phone call. The man’s voice that meets her is gruff and serious but unfailingly polite.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Davidson I presume. My son speaks very highly of you”, he says and Fiona takes a second to figure it out. “I’m sorry to call like this but Sam’s not home from school yet-“</p>
<p>“It’s no worries, Mr. Winchester. Sam’s probably at practice.”</p>
<p>“Practice?” Mr. Winchester injects, clearly nonplussed.</p>
<p>“Yeah, your son is on the football team. Well on his way to making the regulars if I hear correctly from the coach”, Fiona says quite happily. “I’m sure there was information on the permission slip he brought you to get signed last week…”</p>
<p>There is a few moments of absolute silence from the other end of the line. Then: “Yes, of course, must have slipped my mind.”</p>
<p>Fiona makes a humming sound. Having your son on the football team is a point of pride for most fathers, she has a hard time believing he forgot about it. She looks on the big clock on the wall. “Actually, it should be over about now. He’ll be on his way in a couple of minutes, tops”, she tells him.</p>
<p>“Ah, I see, thank you, ma’am but is there any way I could have you go fetch him? It’s just, something’s happened and I need to get him home as soon as possible…”</p>
<p>Is this how it ends, then? A phone call from his dad and then off to another town, never enough time to set down roots, always on the move. She feels bad for Sam. He hasn’t even had a chance to really get to know anyone.</p>
<p>“Is everything all right, Mr. Winchester?” she asks tentatively.</p>
<p>“Oh, there’s nothing to worry about, I just really need my boys to get back here. It’s a family matter”, Mr. Winchester explains without explaining anything.</p>
<p>“Yes, of course, I understand”, Fiona says and thinks she understands more than Mr. Winchester realizes. “I’ll go down to fetch him. Will his brother come and pick him up?” she inquires.</p>
<p>“Yeah, yeah, he’s already on his way, should be there in a few minutes”, Mr. Winchester assures her.</p>
<p>They take a polite farewell and Fiona mentally confirms where Sam gets his manners from, even if he’s miles away from the smooth way Mr. Winchester managed to wrap her up in a sense of security. She looks at the phone like it might provide some answers, before she bustles off to the football field.</p>
<p>As she suspected, the players are already gone. She speaks a couple of words with the gym teacher and coach who points her to the changing rooms. She thanks him and hurries over.</p>
<p>In the boys’ locker room there is steam coming out of the showers and sweat permeates the air. When she knocks there is a sudden flurry of movement but they’re all covered by towels or at least half-dressed when she steps in.</p>
<p>“Sorry, boys!” she calls and scans the area, trying to catch Sam.</p>
<p>“Mrs. Davidson”, a few answer her, shuffling around.</p>
<p>“I heard you’re working hard”, she chats and there is a mumbling answer. “You haven’t seen Sam, have you?” she asks when she gives up the search.</p>
<p>He’s not among them and for a few heart throbbing seconds she panics. If he’s gone while his father is looking for him…</p>
<p>“Mrs. Davidson?” Sam’s voice rise above the buzz. “What are you doing here? This is the boys’ room”, he tells her and she almost laughs at his confused expression. Then she remembers in what purpose she’s here.</p>
<p>“Sam, your dad called”, she tells him and then wonders what words actually came out of her mouth because his face loses all its pallor. In the steamy room where they’re still red-faced and sweating from practice it’s quite an accomplishment. “He wants you home as soon as you can be ready”, she continues.</p>
<p>Sam thanks her and turns around.</p>
<p>Fiona will forever remember the exact moment her eyes fell on his back. With only a towel wrapped around him, Sam’s skin is displayed in a way that his normal attire never allow for. His back is covered in abrasions and scars. Several areas have an unnatural green and yellow hue telling the story of week old bruises. On his right leg there are scabs running from his ankle all the way up to his knee.</p>
<p>She doesn’t know what kind of noise she makes but Sam seems to register it because he turns back and looks at her, meets her eyes and she sees when he understands what she’s staring at. His jaw drops from the tense clenching they’d been doing and he doesn’t say a word as he hurriedly pulls a shirt over his body. Within seconds he’s fully dressed, picks up his bag and steps around her to get out.</p>
<p>The other boys are staring at her. No one says anything. She doesn’t know what to tell them, what to ask. She knows football is a body-contact sport with a lot of injuries, but she also knows that damage like that doesn’t come from a game they allow 12 year olds to play.</p>
<p>“When you’re done changing, please come to my office”, she tells them and steps out.</p>
<p>She feels cold all the way into her bones.</p>
<p align="center">~*~</p>
<p>“Get changed, we’re heading out immediately”, John tells Sam as soon as the boys arrive back at the house.</p>
<p>Sam throws his bag on the floor and disappears into his room. Dean, who’s already dressed and ready to go stands by the door, looking at John. He raises an eyebrow. <em>What?</em></p>
<p>“Are you sure about bringing him along?” Dean asks and it’s the closest to disobedience Dean has been in years.</p>
<p>“He’s twelve. At that age you had two werewolves, several spirits and a black dog under your belt. He’s been mothered enough.”</p>
<p>Dean looks like he still has something to say but John isn’t really interested in hearing what it is.</p>
<p>“Go check everything’s in the car”, he tells him.</p>
<p>They both know there’s no need. The car’s always ready and Dean saw him earlier, before he called Sam’s school, check over the contents himself. He goes anyway. John breathes a sigh of relief. What is it about Sam that gets Dean like this? He’s a tough kid, never been squeamish or questioned John’s orders but with Sam, he’s…</p>
<p>He doesn’t have time to think of an appropriate word before Sam shoots out of his room. Cargo pants, combat boots, duffle over one shoulder and a rifle over the other. He got it for his twelfth birthday and hasn’t gone on a hunt without it. John almost smiles. Like this he can finally recognize a part of himself in his youngest.</p>
<p>“Dean’s already outside. Get going”, he says.</p>
<p>“Yessir.”</p>
