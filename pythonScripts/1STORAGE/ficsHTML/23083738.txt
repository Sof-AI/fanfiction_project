          <div class="userstuff"><p>
  <span>“Binghe’s birthday is soon,” Shizun observes over breakfast.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He hasn’t yet touched the snowy bowl of congee placed in front of him, hair loose around his shoulders and hands folded elegantly in his lap. There’s a red mark on his throat, right near his jaw, that his robe isn’t high enough to cover. Luo Binghe can’t stop staring at it. Shizun is always beautiful, but particularly so in the mornings, when the austere mask hasn’t yet been affixed. He’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>vulnerable</span>
  </em>
  <span> around Luo Binghe, and the thought alone makes his cheeks heat. Even as a lowly disciple Luo Binghe had been secretly entranced by Shizun’s gentle looks in the morning and touched himself furtively at night.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And now Luo Binghe can stare openly all the time and touch Shizun at any hour.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instead of asking more of Shizun, however, he sets plates of danbing and zhengjiao next to the congee. He kept Shizun up late last night, after all, which means he’s going to need extra energy this morning.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It is, Shizun,” Luo Binghe answers finally, anticipation fluttering in his stomach as he sits across from Shizun.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun takes the bowl of congee finally, face thoughtful. “This teacher had always given Binghe gifts, before…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before Luo Binghe had spent three years in the abyss and returned for Shizun, only to have him sacrifice himself for Luo Binghe’s sake in a matter of weeks. Luo Binghe will never forget a single day of the terrible five years that followed. But Shizun is here now, and that’s all Luo Binghe cares about.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You did, Shizun,” Luo Binghe says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I thought I might, ah, give you a gift this year,” Shizun murmurs, very focused on the congee. “If Binghe is amenable.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want everything Shizun wants to give me,” Luo Binghe replies immediately. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Everything</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Binghe!” Shizun exclaims, and hides his face behind a fan, shaking his head as though Luo Binghe has done something embarrassing again.  After a pause, though, he relents and sighs with rueful amusement. “Since it’s your birthday, did you have anything in particular you wished for?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shizun,” Luo Binghe says before Shizun has even finished speaking. “I want Shizun.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The fan, which had almost been lowered, is raised again, Shizun’s cool dark eyes studying Luo Binghe’s face over the edge, at odds with the pink in his cheeks that just crests the top of the fan. “Surely there is something else that you want,” he protests. “Binghe can’t possibly just want </span>
  <em>
    <span>me</span>
  </em>
  <span> the whole day.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why not?” Luo Binghe proclaims. “I want Shizun to stay by my side forever.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun clears his throat and stares fixedly past Luo Binghe. “You already have—that. Have—have me,” he says, and clears his throat again. “So that can’t count. That’s not a sufficient gift.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With incredible restraint, Luo Binghe doesn’t shove aside their breakfast in favor of laying Shizun out on the floor and eating him instead. He does consider it for a long moment. Shizun’s head tilted back, bare skin and long limbs on display, a pearlescent gleam at the head of his cock…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want whatever Shizun wants to give me, then, so long as he spends the entire day with me,” Luo Binghe requests. “Please, Shizun?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun’s fan snaps closed, his expression a little uncertain. “You </span>
  <em>
    <span>really</span>
  </em>
  <span> can’t think of anything else that you’d like to receive?” Shizun stresses, but at the mulish set of Luo Binghe’s jaw, he acquiesces. “Very well. What a sticky disciple you are! How did I raise one such as you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binghe lowers his gaze, head bowed a little, but Shizun’s hand just comes to rest gently on his hair. “Hm. I suppose it is </span>
  <em>
    <span>your</span>
  </em>
  <span> birthday. If that is what you desire…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binghe beams, heart fluttering. “And we’ll do whatever I want?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun arches a brow, lips slightly pursed, then gestures with his fan. “Yes,” he promises.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you!” Luo Binghe cries, and can’t help peppering Shizun with a dozen kisses, then two dozen, stopping only when Shizun pushes him away and commands him to eat breakfast before it gets any colder. Shizun’s lips are slightly puffy from being kissed so much, and Luo Binghe thrills at the idea that on his birthday, he’ll be able to kiss them raw and cling to Shizun as he pleases.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No need for such a fuss, eat,” Shizun scolds.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Once they’re done, however, there’s nothing stopping Luo Binghe from stealing more kisses. Well, nothing except Shizun’s insistence that Luo Binghe is distracting him and he has to go to Cang Qiong Peak for the next couple of days. Luo Binghe can’t stop him, wouldn’t, but he does get Shizun to promise that Luo Binghe can join him once Luo Binghe’s duties are finished.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Just as Shizun is leaving, however, a thought occurs, and Luo Binghe inquires curiously, “Shizun, why </span>
  <em>
    <span>do</span>
  </em>
  <span> you need to speak with Shang-shishu so badly?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s a distinctly militant gleam in Shizun’s eyes. “We must discuss a novel extra.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With that, he turns crisply on his heel, draws Xiu Ya, and rises into the air.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binghe stares after him, brow furrowed in confusion, but ultimately decides that Shizun can handle himself against that little retainer of Mobei-Jun’s, no matter how squirrelly he is. With a resolute nod, he turns away to attend to his own affairs. While Shizun is gone, Luo Binghe is going to ensure that all of the demon world is in order.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After all, nothing can be permitted to interfere with his time at Qing Jing Peak.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Like a child, the closer that they get to Luo Binghe’s birthday, the stickier he gets around Shizun, eagerly counting down the seconds until he gets to have Shizun </span>
  <em>
    <span>all to himself</span>
  </em>
  <span> for a </span>
  <em>
    <span>whole day</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Although Shizun fusses about Luo Binghe’s behavior, he also doesn’t push Luo Binghe away—Luo Binghe doesn’t even have to resort to the tears that make Shizun blush so prettily.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the night before, Luo Binghe is practically vibrating out of his skin. He can’t stop watching Shizun as he braids his hair and blows out the candles, skin glowing in the pale moonlight as he joins Luo Binghe in their bed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binghe wraps himself around Shizun, satisfied when he feels Shizun relax in his arms the way he does around no one else, his natural reserve warming until he even steals a kiss from Luo Binghe before he falls asleep.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binghe can hardly breathe around how precious Shizun feels in his arms.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And all he will ever wish for, this year and every year to come, is that Shizun stays by his side, in whatever capacity Shizun desires.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binge awakens before dawn. Shizun is still sleeping, so Luo Binghe creeps off to cook for him before Shizun can protest. Shizun sometimes has very strange notions about what Luo Binghe ‘should’ find relaxing, and would likely fuss about Luo Binghe cooking for Shizun on Luo Binghe’s birthday as though cooking for Shizun isn’t one of Luo Binghe’s most sacred and beloved routines.</span>
</p><p><span>He sets to making congee, letting it simmer while he makes youtiao and soup dumplings</span> <span>stuffed with pork and crab. Only when it’s all plated to his satisfaction, along with some heavily fragrant tea and a few snacks for the day, does he dare to bring it to his Shizun, setting it all on the table.</span></p><p>
  <span>Shizun stirs at the smell of food, then jerks upright, hair a soft tangle around his face. “Binghe,” he murmurs, voice rough with sleep. “You needn’t have—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wanted to, Shizun,” Luo Binghe interrupts firmly. “It’s my birthday, so I can do as I please, can’t I? And I wanted to cook for Shizun.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s a moment of suspicious consideration, before Shizun mutters something that sounds very much like, “You always do as you please,” before slipping out of bed with a shake of his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He does press a soft kiss to Luo Binghe’s forehead, though, right over the demon seal, before he washes, brushes out his hair, and pulls on an outer robe before taking his usual seat. Luo Binghe’s heart feels like it’s glowing in his chest, full of Shizun’s love.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They eat in companionable silence, but as Luo Binghe finishes off the last of the dumplings, Shizun says, “You never did tell me what it is that you want to do today besides stay by my side.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It doesn’t matter what we do,” Luo Binghe answers with a shy smile. “So long as I’m with Shizun.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although Shizun’s expression remains cool and distant, his eyes are soft, body radiating gentle warmth. Luo Binghe has never figured out what thawed Shizun’s heart, but he is forever grateful for it. “That’s not proper,” Shizun scolds, but then his cheeks slowly heat and he can’t meet Luo Binghe’s gaze. “However, this teacher…I…have two gifts for you, that may give Binghe some ideas…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh?” Luo Binghe asks, perking up. “Please give them to me right away, Shizun!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun grabs the first fan that is in reach and taps Luo Binghe lightly on the head. “Patience.” Despite his chastising words, though, he hastens to a small trunk in the corner of the room that’s sealed to everyone but Shizun. He opens it and removes two boxes, one a beautifully carved wooden box about the length of Luo Binghe’s hand, the other considerably larger and made of metal etched with inscriptions and seals. Shizun brings them both over, and hands the wooden box to Luo Binghe first.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Before you open it, I have something to say,” Shizun warns.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s quiet for a time though, as though crafting every precious word. Luo Binghe waits for him to speak patiently.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m glad you were born,” Shizun finally says quietly. He swallows, lashes lowering and a flush high on his cheeks. “Binghe’s life is very precious.” He inhales sharply, and then gestures to the box, hiding his face behind the fan. “Open it, then.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>With trembling fingers, Luo Binghe opens the first box.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Inside is an exquisite jade pendant the exact shade of green of the bamboo of Qing Jing Peak. Luo Binghe’s fingers trace over it several times, eyes filling with tears as he recognizes Shizun’s spiritual energy steadily pulsing within it. “Shizun…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It isn’t much,” Shizun hastens to clarify. “Merely…an extra resource, should Binghe ever need it. You just have to break the jade and you’ll receive some of my spiritual energy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binghe won’t ever break it—he refuses. But it’s a gift beyond price merely for the fact that a little piece of Shizun will be with him always, no matter how far apart circumstances force them. It will also be an incentive to return home as fast as he can. He lifts the jade from the box and presses it to his chest. “Thank you, Shizun. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Thank you</span>
  </em>
  <span>.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun waves his hand. “What, what, there’s no need to make such a fuss. It’s a small token, that’s all, that’s all! You needn’t—</span>
  <em>
    <span>mmfph</span>
  </em>
  <span>!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binghe kisses Shizun extremely thoroughly, tongue sweeping into Shizun’s mouth until Luo Binghe can feel him panting for air, lips searing hot. He pulls away with reluctance, but can’t help diving back in when he sees Shizun’s lips slick with split, eyes half-lidded. His fingers briefly tangle in Shizun’s loose hair before he stands, hurrying to put the pendant next to his personal seal.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then Luo Binghe kneels obediently next to Shizun again, waiting for the other gift.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Clearing his throat, Shizun somehow blushes even </span>
  <em>
    <span>more</span>
  </em>
  <span> as he offers Luo Binghe the second box. “Whatever you do,” he warns, “don’t say improper things out loud, understand?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Curious, Luo Binghe opens the box. His eyes go very, very wide. He thinks he says something, but doesn’t know what over the roar in his ears. His head snaps up to look at Shizun, who has his fan up and is looking determinedly out the window. Luo Binghe looks back down at the contents of the box, then back up at Shizun. The blush is spreading to his ears, and down his throat to where his sleeping robes are tightly closed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Immortal binding cables.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun has gifted him immortal binding cables.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Instantly, Luo Binghe is a young teen all over again, shamefully stealing glances at his Shizun’s elegant form, the jade of his skin, and remembering exactly how his Shizun had looked while helpless in the grasp of the immortal binding cables.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As though he knows the exact tenor of Luo Binghe’s thoughts, Shizun’s brow furrows ever so slightly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binghe slides his fingertips along the fine material, feeling the power bound into the ropes. They’re strong, and there are three of them, which is more than enough for Luo Binghe to bind Shizun wholly and completely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Have him at Luo Binghe’s mercy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binghe’s heart skips a beat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun is fast, but Luo Binghe is faster, and Luo Binghe has him up against the wall in a split second, one of the immortal binding cables in hand as Luo Binghe kisses him senseless. Or perhaps it’s Luo Binghe that’s senseless; he feels out of control, overwhelmed, starving for the knowledge that Shizun is willing to make himself vulnerable to Luo Binghe by choice. He can’t stop kissing Shizun long enough to even make use of the immortal binding cables.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun’s fingers grip his shoulders, but instead of pushing him back, they’re digging in, holding him close. Luo Binghe is going to be permitted to trap Shizun in his arms—for just a day, but it’s enough.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s a gift.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The world can intrude tomorrow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binghe’s mouth moves to Shizun’s jaw, then throat, finding the place where Shizun was bruised mere days ago, and turns the patch of skin scarlet with his teeth and tongue. Shizun gasps when Luo Binghe’s hands slide beneath his ass and lift him slightly so Luo Binghe can get a better angle, littering Shizun’s skin with marks. He chases the noises Shizun makes right back to his lips, kissing him like this will imprint something on their souls.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s so easy to push aside Shizun’s thin robes, to lift him up against the wall so that Luo Binghe can press close to him and let Shizun wrap his legs around Luo Binghe’s waist. Shizun’s head tilts back against the stone, baring his throat again, and Luo Binghe cannot resist that elegant length when it’s so generously presented to him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Before long, Shizun’s hips are rocking against Luo Binghe’s stomach, soft little moans escaping as Luo Binghe mars his jade skin so thoroughly that for the next </span>
  <em>
    <span>week</span>
  </em>
  <span> everyone will know precisely what they did on Luo Binghe’s birthday.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Binghe, ah,” Shizun pants, lashes brushing his cheekbones. “Ah, please!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s so close, Luo Binghe knows the signs intimately, and wraps a hand around Shizun’s cock. He strokes Shizun steadily staring down at the way Shizun is biting his lip. Shizun is going to come a lot today; no need to rush the first one.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And, perhaps since it’s his birthday, Luo Binghe will be a </span>
  <em>
    <span>little</span>
  </em>
  <span> selfish. He doesn’t dare be truly selfish, but he thinks—</span>
  <em>
    <span>hopes</span>
  </em>
  <span>—that Shizun will forgive Luo Binghe for tormenting him just this once. Just this once, Luo Binghe’s desperate to be selfish, to take Shizun apart over and over on his own terms and know that </span>
  <em>
    <span>he </span>
  </em>
  <span>did that, </span>
  <em>
    <span>he</span>
  </em>
  <span> left Shizun beautifully defiled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun comes in long pulses over Luo Binghe’s palm and his own clothing, thighs tight around Luo Binghe’s waist as he fucks Luo Binghe’s hand before sagging in Luo Binghe’s secure grip, dazed by pleasure. The little sound he unconsciously makes when Luo Binghe slides his thumb across the head of Shizun’s cock is </span>
  <em>
    <span>obscene</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binghe licks his hand clean, and only when he’s sure Shizun will be steady on his feet does Luo Binghe set him down. He goes to his knees beside the immortal binding cable, which he only now realizes that he dropped somewhere along the way. Shizun blinks at him, confused, only to fist his hands in Luo Binghe’s hair as he licks Shizun clean too, just as he’d licked his fingers clean, while Shizun half-heartedly complains about Luo Binghe’s impatience and indecency, and how Luo Binghe didn’t find his satisfaction, and that Luo Binghe better not expect Shizun to be immediately ready for more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But there </span>
  <em>
    <span>is</span>
  </em>
  <span> a promise of more on his lips, so all is well.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Pleased, Luo Binghe carries Shizun to the bed, recklessly saying, “Of course we couldn’t properly start until I’d eaten, Shizun!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It takes Shizun a split second to realize what Luo Binghe meant, and then he tugs his robe closed and stalk over to their bed, flustered and unable to hide it. Luo Binghe kisses his temple cheerily, tidying away the dishes and setting the snacks in easy reach before bringing the box with the immortal binding cables over. Shizun’s regained some small measure of his composure, but he looks a little uncertain, a little overwhelmed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Only then does it really sink in, what Luo Binghe is about to do.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They gaze at each other, a sudden frisson of excitement, or nervousness, or wonder in the air between them. Luo Binghe’s pulse thunders in his chest, and he rests his fingertips on top of Shizun’s heart. It’s pounding too, but Shizun catches his fingers and brings them to his lips, kissing them.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I trust you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binghe’s throat tightens. Shizun doesn’t say words he doesn’t mean, not ever, and his trust is a gift beyond price. When Luo Binghe had thought he’d lost it, he’d—he’d—he exhales a soft, shuddering breath. Shizun wipes away Luo Binghe’s tears, hands careful and warm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well?” he asks. “Is Binghe going to use his gift or not?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binghe would never be so churlish as to throw away even the simplest gift of Shizun’s, let alone this. His hands are surprisingly steady as he slides Shizun’s clothes off, gathering his hair in a knot so it’s out of the way while he works. Shizun has his eyes closed, breathing softly, but his back is stiff and he’s clearly trying to ignore what’s about to happen lest he overthink matters.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Luo Binghe is patient. He wants this to be good, and so he touches Shizun without purpose, easy and calm, until he relaxes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Only then does he take the first cable and knot it just under Shizun’s chest, beginning an intricate series of twists and knots that ends with Shizun’s torso bound. After a moment’s debate, he binds Shizun’s hands behind him, even daring to bring the cable up across Shizun’s throat, although its purposefully loose so as not to harm him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binghe studies his work, cock twitching beneath his clothing. The red immortal binding cables are stunning against Shizun’s skin, and Luo Binghe can see the way every breath makes them bite ever so slightly into his ribs. He swallows, and touches one of Shizun’s nipples.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not a woman,” Shizun snaps, but he twitches slightly. The pressure of the cables framing them have made them even more sensitive than usual, and when Luo Binghe tweaks them again, Shizun’s lips part on a silent moan.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After that, he isn’t able to complain seriously about Luo Binghe touching them anymore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then he isn’t able to complain at all, as Luo Binghe presses Shizun down to the pillows and silences Shizun with his tongue.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binghe is determined to savor this, even though some distant part of him—which is untenable, some days, and almost silent on others—clamors for him to take Shizun, claim him, press inside him and possess him, desperate as much for security as for a taste of Shizun. If he’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>enough</span>
  </em>
  <span>, he won’t ever be abandoned by his most special person again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun gazes up at him, pupils huge, cock just barely hard between his thighs. It’s indecent, to be dressed like this when Shizun is naked, but Luo Binghe can’t resist staying clothed when Shizun reacts even to the brush of fabric over his skin, shivering like Luo Binghe is doing far more intimate acts. A few times the muscles of his arms twitch, like he’s trying to reach for Luo Binghe before he realizes he can’t, and Luo Binghe traces his nail over the places where cable meets skin.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just do it,” Shizun demands, as though reluctant, but beneath Luo Binghe’s body, his thighs spread wide of his own volition. “Don’t keep this—don’t keep me waiting!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The immortal binding cables are for more than just Luo Binghe, then. His birthday was just the excuse. Delight sparks in his veins, and he silences Shizun with another series of kisses before sliding down his body and finding all the new places that the cables have made him sensitive. The muscle of Shizun’s thighs twitch every time Luo Binghe slows, and the position of his arms means his back is bowed, presenting his chest even more fully.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>By the time Luo Binghe has made it to Shizun’s hips, his toes are curling  and his cock is fully hard once more. After rummaging for some oil and stripping off his clothes, he patiently opens up Shizun just the way Luo Binghe has learned he likes best. He hasn’t even gotten to four fingers before Shizun is rolling his hips, biting his lower lip to keep the sounds from escaping.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binghe teases him, just barely brushing against the spot inside him that makes him shake, until Shizun opens his mouth to demand Luo Binghe do this properly—as though there’s anything proper about this—and Luo Binghe uses the chance to press directly on the spot.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun moans, back arching as he shoves down on Luo Binghe’s fingers, and then looks startled by his own desire, his own eagerness. Luo Binghe doesn’t give him the chance to second guess himself, giving him what he so earnestly needs again and again. He even goes so far as to lift one of Shizun’s legs up over his shoulder so that Luo Binghe’s fingers can press deeper.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun leaks steadily onto his stomach, and Luo Binghe’s tongue darts out again. Sweat and precome linger on his tongue, salty and pungent, and Luo Binghe wants another taste of Shizun. He licks the tip of Shizun’s cock, then sucks gently, and Shizun suddenly squirms beneath him, eyes wide as he hisses, “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Binghe</span>
  </em>
  <span>!” before coming all over Luo Binghe’s lips and throat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s mortification, not pleasure that makes Shizun stammer over his words, but Luo Binghe just collects it all before licking his fingers clean. His other hand fucks Shizun steadily through his orgasm and the aftershocks until Shizun shakes his head back and forth, groaning even as he rides Luo Binghe’s fingers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t mind,” Luo Binghe assures as Shizun loses track of what he’s saying. “So long as Shizun feels good, feels </span>
  <em>
    <span>so</span>
  </em>
  <span> good, so long as this disciple is why Shizun couldn’t help himself, this disciple could never mind Shizun chasing his pleasure…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t speak like that,” Shizun threatens breathlessly but the words are muddled by pleasure, spoken out of habit more than anything.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright, Shizun,” Luo Binghe replies obediently, and pulls his fingers free and wipes them clean.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then he lifts Shizun up, easily compensating for Shizun’s lack of balance with his bound arms, and settles himself against their pillows with Shizun in his lap. Shizun is not a small man, but somehow he fits just right in Luo Binghe’s arms.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m going to do it, Shizun,” Luo Binghe whispers against Shizun’s lips, and when Shizun nods, Luo Binghe eases Shizun down onto his cock.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But instead of fucking up immediately into Shizun’s incredible heat, Luo Binghe allows him to adjust, to sink down until the curve of his body meets Luo Binghe’s. There’s no risk of Luo Binghe softening so long as he’s in Shizun, and that fervor to savor every moment rises to the forefront. He strokes Shizun’s back, tracing the immortal binding cables as Shizun rests his forehead on Luo Binghe’s collarbone, hot breath sliding over the rough skin of Luo Binghe’s scar. Shizun has touched it before, when they were like this, covered it with his palm like he would erase it if he could, some unspeakable sorrow clutching his heart in its fist.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Luo Binghe wouldn’t permit it to be erased. It was given to him by Shizun, after all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The pair of them sit there, joined, as Luo Binghe’s hands wander freely and Shizun quivers and occasionally clenches around him. He even dares to brush his fingers against where he’s inside Shizun, feeling Shizun stretched so perfectly around him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Binghe…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just a little longer, Shizun, just a little longer, just like this,” Luo Binghe pleads. “Shizun feels so good around me, he’s so warm and soft. I just need this for a little longer.” He tucks a strand of hair behind Shizun’s ear, lips catching Shizun’s own until Shizun sighs and surrenders without protest. Luo Binghe can almost taste the way Shizun’s heart has unfurled in his chest, defenses burned away by pleasure and Luo Binghe.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun is powerless like this. Dependent on Luo Binghe. When he finally lifts his head, even the most reserved corners of his heart are easily in reach, and Luo Binghe strokes his cheek.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Binghe,” Shizun sighs again, but it has a very different tenor this time. Yearning. Gentle. At ease. “You really are such a ridiculous disciple…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binghe smiles, fingers lacing with Shizun’s behind his back. “I’m yours,” he says simply.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun huffs a laugh from some deep well of happiness, leaning forward and entrusting his weight and balance to Luo Binghe. Only then does Luo Binghe’s control snap, and he begins to thrust inside Shizun, holding him in place and forcing him to take Luo Binghe’s length.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Despite their brief break, Shizun’s reserve is nowhere in sight, and his head falls back with a cry as Luo Binghe angles him so that every time he fucks into Shizun, Shizun receives just as much pleasure as lances through Luo Binghe’s body.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s nothing but the sounds of their pleasure in the air and the awareness of each other’s bodies. Luo Binghe doesn’t know how he could ever forget just how Shizun feels around him, and yet every time it’s as precious and new as the first time. He bites Shizun’s collar bone, fingers flicking his raw nipples, while Shizun gasps and whimpers, overwrought already. Luo Binghe traces the length of Shizun’s cock with his nails and then strokes his balls, too.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s no part of Shizun that isn’t hallowed ground to Luo Binghe, not a single part that Luo Binghe would fail to worship.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Times loses meaning, Luo Binghe effortlessly fucking Shizun until Shizun’s noises take on the particular tenor that means he’s close.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you going to come for me, Shizun?” Luo Binghe purrs into his ear. “It’s so soon! But I could never get tired of the taste of Shizun, I’d lick every part of his body if he’d let me. This disciple loves seeing Shizun feel good, loves knowing that he’s the reason Shizun feels good.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Binghe!” Shizun sounds strangled, scandalized, and so desperate for more that he fights the immortal binding cables despite being stripped of his power. “Ah, please, </span>
  <em>
    <span>please</span>
  </em>
  <span>!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s my birthday,” Luo Binghe teases, licking and nipping Shizun’s skin. “I was patient for so long, waiting to see what Shizun would give me, can’t Shizun be patient for a little? Shizun was patient enough to let me just stay inside him, filling him up, what’s a little longer now…”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Something within Shizun is shattering, and when he moans, it’s the loudest Luo Binghe has ever heard him. His cock keeps twitching between them, and Shizun arches with each of Luo Binghe’s thrusts, not just encouraging him to hit the spot inside Shizun, but trying to get him to let Shizun rub his cock against Luo Binghe’s stomach.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binghe lets Shizun fight for every grain of sensation, body thrumming with avarice as Shizun’s clear eyes turn hazy, as his reason slips away, as he becomes a creature of sensation and desire that needs only Luo Binghe. It’s only fair, since Luo Binghe lives for Shizun.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>At last relenting, Luo Binghe rubs his thumb gently over the sensitive skin just below the head of Shizun’s cock. In answer, Shizun’s body seizes, and he comes so hard he nearly reaches Luo Binghe’s face again. Luo Binghe fucks him through this orgasm too, as Shizun </span>
  <em>
    <span>whimpers</span>
  </em>
  <span>, then nearly sobs Luo Binghe’s name over and over, searing hot and so, </span>
  <em>
    <span>so </span>
  </em>
  <span>tight around Luo Binghe.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s no holding on then, and Luo Binghe wouldn’t try.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The pleasure is like a star, lighting him up from the inside out. He lets it consume him, Shizun occasionally twitching around him in a way that only prolongs how </span>
  <em>
    <span>whole</span>
  </em>
  <span> he feels.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But even this must come to an end, and when he stirs, it’s with the realization that Shizun is limp on top of him, breathing deeply. Luo Binghe is still half hard inside him but doesn’t pull free, savoring the way they’re tangled together and nuzzling Shizun without protest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I love you, Shizun,” Luo Binghe whispers, a mantra, as Shizun buries his face in Luo Binghe’s neck.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s not much longer before Shizun’s fingers are too cold and stiff for Luo Binghe’s comfort, and he gently unknots the immortal binding cables and stretches Shizun out on their bed, rubbing his hands and arms while gently streaming spiritual energy into Shizun’s body to get his blood flowing and meridians open. When he’s sure that Shizun is resting peacefully, Luo Binghe tries to get spare cloth to tidy them up, but  he can’t get far without Shizun sleepily complaining and clumsily reaching out for Luo Binghe like he’s forgotten how his limbs work. Luo Binghe promptly decides that they can clean up later, allowing Shizun to nuzzle into Luo Binghe like he’s an oversized blanket.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They both doze for an hour or so. Luo Binghe doesn’t walk into Shizun’s dreams, precisely, but he has an awareness of the way their dreams curl around each other, just as their bodies are curled around each other, and is all the more secure for knowing it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun stirs first, but doesn’t pull his robe back on or fret about the lack of cleanliness. Instead, he’s unusually open and comfortable, smiling gently as he kisses the scar on Luo Binghe’s chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shizun, how are you feeling?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mm, Binghe made me feel good,” Shizun confesses, and there’s almost—almost a </span>
  <em>
    <span>giggle</span>
  </em>
  <span> in Shizun’s voice that Luo Binghe doesn’t know what to do with. “Thank you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“N-No, thank </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span>, Shizun,” Luo Binghe hastens to reply, blushing furiously. “Are you hungry?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun doesn’t answer, but he doesn’t protest when Luo Binghe holds tidbits of the snacks he brought earlier to his lips, either. Luo Binghe feeds them both, and glances at their window. From the sunlight, it’s somewhere around midday. No need to leave their bed just yet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Was that good for Shizun? It wasn’t…too much, was it?” Luo Binghe asks shyly as Shizun finally seems to wake up properly, finally pulling the sheets up over his body, which is littered with various bruises and raw skin where he fought the immortal binding cables. Part of Luo Binghe worries that he pushed too hard; the rest of him luxuriates in the evidence, and the way Shizun glances down at himself and colors faintly, but says nothing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Must you always ask such things?” Shizun complains. It’s not a disagreement, however. It’s even less of a disagreement as he adds neutrally, “It is still Binghe’s birthday. This teacher is well enough.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oh. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Oh</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binghe lowers his lashes, glancing up at Shizun with just the right kind of maidenly shyness. “Is that so? Then…could it be that Shizun would allow me to touch him again?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It is still Binghe’s birthday,” Shizun repeats placidly, but Luo Binghe suspects his heart is anything but.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He reaches out, cupping Shizun’s cheek, and Shizun turns to kiss his palm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun truly is a gift greater than Luo Binghe could have ever conceived, but even so Luo Binghe wonders if this is all a dream, if the Dream Demon is consuming his energy, bite by bite, as Luo Binghe whiles away his life in so pleasant an illusion. Then he shakes his head, exasperated with himself; as though he wouldn’t notice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun’s affection was hard won, and is cherished. Honored. Luo Binghe will stake his life on it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Whatever Binghe desires,” Shizun says simply, “is his.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This time, when Luo Binghe binds Shizun, it’s with his hands in front, so that he can touch Luo Binghe, should he desire. Luo Binghe hopes very, very much that he will, and given how eagerly Shizun lifts his arms over Luo Binghe’s head, winding his fingers into Luo Binghe’s hair as he initiates a kiss, Shizun wants to touch Luo Binghe just as much.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun is still soft and open from Luo Binghe being inside him earlier, slick oil and seed making a mess. Luo Binghe licks it away, adding fresh oil to his fingers as he stretches Shizun again, thumb pressing against the soft skin behind his balls until Shizun is starting to breathe heavily, his cock half-hard between his thighs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binghe drags his fingers across Shizun’s hips and then loosely wraps them around his cock. It takes a little longer now for Shizun to harden, but he stares down at Luo Binghe’s hand and his hips are twitching eagerly for more within a matter of heartbeats.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mm, Shizun,” Luo Binghe croons. “Shizun’s so beautiful. So warm, so—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Binghe, stop speaking,” Shizun interrupts, and Luo Binghe kisses him, laughing into his mouth, filling him with sunshine.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But he obeys, and doesn’t speak. He just shows Shizun what he wants with his body, flipping Shizun on top so that he’s straddling Luo Binghe’s hips, hands pressed to Luo Binghe’s chest for balance.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s a refusal in Shizun’s face, but Luo Binghe just pouts and coaxes, “Please?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s—it’s—” Shizun doesn’t quite know how to finish his protest, defenses whittled away by his own pleasure and Luo Binghe’s body beneath his, Luo Binghe’s hands on his hips, thumbs stroking his skin. Reverent. Patient. In love. “Fine.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binghe grins shamelessly at him, and Shizun flicks his forehead, right over the demon seal, before letting Luo Binghe guide his cock into Shizun’s body once more.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binghe will never tire of this.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun shifts, eyes narrowed, taking stock of his balance and positioning and adjusting accordingly. Shizun is an exemplary fighter, and never goes into battle unprepared. Luo Binghe bites his lips as Shizun gradually begins to find his pace, muscles flexing beneath Luo Binghe’s fingers as he starts to ride Luo Binghe. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sweat rolls down Shizun’s back and drops onto Luo Binghe, hair sticking to his skin. Luo Binghe can feel the blankets beneath him growing damp too but doesn’t care. Can’t. Not when Shizun manages to roll his hips and gasp just once, lashes fluttering, when the pleasure starts to build.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun is sensitive though, from coming so many times, and tenses, eyes shut, when Luo Binghe touches his cock. “No,” he mutters, shaking his head. “Binghe can—Binghe can…do it inside. I don’t need more.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is Shizun sure?” Luo Binghe asks innocently. “It looks like Shizun really wants to have more, he was riding my fingers and even now, he’s so </span>
  <em>
    <span>hard</span>
  </em>
  <span>.” He grips Shizun’s cock firmly, rubbing the head of it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun jerks, squirming as his body tries to decide whether he wants more or wants to escape, but there’s nowhere for him to go so long as Luo Binghe is holding onto him. “I—I—” he stammers, hips speeding up as his body claims victory, fucking himself back on Luo Binghe’s cock and forward into his hand in a swift rhythm.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binghe can’t help raising his knees, giving Shizun something to brace himself against, and also conveniently letting Luo Binghe match Shizun’s thrusts.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun blinks blearily down at him, a flush spreading down his cheeks to his chest, nails digging into Luo Binghe’s stomach. The spark of pain only makes Luo Binghe aware of how close they are, how his skin is burning, and how Shizun is the most exquisite person Luo Binghe has ever seen. He gives Shizun more friction, more force, and Shizun rewards him by falling apart completely.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Every breath is more a shuddering sob than anything, oversensitive pleasure suffusing his face, and Luo Binghe realizes with a stunned gasp, that Shizun is </span>
  <em>
    <span>begging</span>
  </em>
  <span> him, begging for relief only Luo Binghe can grant him. Shizun isn’t merely shattered, he’s been taken apart, and it feels like Shizun’s bliss is merging with Luo Binghe’s own. Shizun clings to him without reserve, and Luo Binghe gives him more and more and </span>
  <em>
    <span>more</span>
  </em>
  <span> without hesitation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun comes, almost like a dream. A waking dream, perhaps, all of the edges of existence mellowed with joy, and Luo Binghe holds him close, kissing him for an age, letting his pleasure pulse between them. Luo Binghe comes too; he can no more resist that than he can resist Shizun.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This is everything he’s ever desired.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That dream-like feeling persists, though, and it takes too long before Luo Binghe realizes that it’s not coming from him. It’s Shizun, pupils still enormous, lips parted as he shivers and moans through aftershocks. Luo Binghe tweaks Shizun’s nipples, and Shizun arches into the touch with a soft cry. Shizun is here, but not, except the part that isn’t here is somehow still here, cradled in Luo Binghe’s chest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binghe swallows. “Shizun, Shizun, can I? Please?” he blurts out. He doesn’t know what he’s asking for, besides more of Shizun, and somehow knows that the answer will be an absolute and unequivocal </span>
  <em>
    <span>yes</span>
  </em>
  <span>.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun blinks slowly as though Luo Binghe’s words are reaching him through syrup, and the muddled pleasure wraps more tightly around them both. “Binghe…” he sighs, full of yearning, and that’s all Luo Binghe needs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He buries his head in Shizun’s lap, feeling Shizun’s fingers clutch his hair as he takes Shizun’s soft cock in his mouth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun hooks his leg over Luo Binghe’s shoulder of his own volition, breathing rough, straining at the immortal binding cables. He whimpers every time Luo Binghe sucks him, and Luo Binghe slides his fingers inside Shizun again. Shizun is filthy inside, but Luo Binghe doesn’t mind, thrusting his fingers and savoring the squelching noise. Shizun whimpers louder, tightening around Luo Binghe, and after a moment Luo Binghe realizes what he needs. Instead of fucking him, Luo Binghe keeps his fingers inside Shizun, gently stroking the spot inside him that makes him feel best, and is rewarded by Shizun gasping his name over and over.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binghe swallows around Shizun’s cock, which hardens slowly, filling Luo Binghe’s mouth without making him choke. With his free hand, he keeps Shizun steady. He hums with happiness, and Shizun throws his head back, suddenly spilling all over Luo Binghe’s tongue. Luo Binghe is just working him through it when Shizun spills again, just a couple tiny spurts of seed that Luo Binghe swallows down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, Shizun is utterly boneless, and the waking dream cradles them both, luxuriant and soft.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Binghe…” Shizun rasps, and Luo Binghe wraps himself around Shizun, letting him hide his face against Luo Binghe’s skin, even if the immortal binding cables don’t let him cling to Luo Binghe the way he desires.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binghe’s brain still feels clouded, their room full of the scent of sex and pleasure. He fumbles as he releases Shizun from his bonds, then curls up next to him again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This time, they don’t sleep—or at least Luo Binghe doesn’t. Shizun won’t let him go anywhere, not even to roll out of Shizun’s hold while staying in the bed with him, and Luo Binghe savors Shizun’s attention.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The sensation of being half in a dream gradually fades, however, and in its wake comes the discomfort of being filthy, and sweaty, and in a closed room. When Shizun still won’t let Luo Binghe move, however, Luo Binghe shrugs and lifts Shizun up into one arm, stripping off the filthy sheets with one hand and bundling them away to be laundered, then opening their window. Crisp winter air streams in, and it won’t be long before the scent is dulled again; although Luo Binghe loves their scent soaking into every corner, Shizun prefers freshness.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Satisfied, he carries Shizun to their bathing chamber, running a steaming hot bath. He lowers Shizun into it, then climbs in himself, massaging Shizun’s limbs and torso while once again channeling spiritual energy into his body.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun comes back to himself by slow heartbeats, smiling faintly at Luo Binghe.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Welcome home, Shizun,” Luo Binghe says sweetly, kissing him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun hums, still smiling. Luo Binghe beams back and washes Shizun thoroughly, even between his fingers and behind his ears, long dark hair pooling in the water around them. Only when Shizun is clean does Luo Binghe turn his attentions to himself, but is undeniably pleased when even now, Shizun stays in contact with him—arm to arm, thigh to thigh, helping Luo Binghe rinse out his hair or stealing kisses as he pleases.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When they’re finished, Luo Binghe gently dries Shizun off and wraps him in a robe before insisting on carrying him back into their bedroom himself. Of course, the minute they step inside, a blast of icy wind makes Shizun sneeze and shiver, so Luo Binghe hastens to close the window and put fresh sheets on the bed so that they can curl up together.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binghe does take a moment, in the midst of all that, to make sure the immortal binding cables make their way back into the box and are set aside for next time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For there will </span>
  <em>
    <span>definitely</span>
  </em>
  <span> be a next time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sometime later, Luo Binghe asks, “Shizun, can I massage you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hm?” Shizun frowns slightly. “What for?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“There are still, ah, rope marks, Shizun. I thought rubbing in some salve would help.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Alright.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun allows himself to be laid out across the clean sheets, and Luo Binghe gently but inexorably rubs a healing oil and salve into Shizun’s skin until he is more relaxed than Luo Binghe thought possible. Although the room still smells faintly of sex to Luo Binghe’s senses, alongside it is apricot kernel oil and the mint of the healing salve, a sweet blend of scents that makes Luo Binghe impulsively kiss Shizun a dozen times as Shizun huffs a laugh against his lips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When Shizun’s stomach growls ferociously, it startles them both. “Shizun didn’t eat lunch!” Luo Binghe blurts, and nearly flings himself out of bed in a panic. “I’ll make something for Shizun right now!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Binghe,” Shizun—Shizun </span>
  <em>
    <span>whines</span>
  </em>
  <span>. “I’m not that hungry.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s a lie. Even Luo Binghe is starving, and he didn’t go through nearly as much…exercise as Shizun did. But stubbornly, Shizun stretches out his hand, frowning, until Luo Binghe uncertainly steps back in reach and Shizun pulls him back onto the bed. The tip of Shizun’s nose is cold as it’s shoved against Luo Binghe’s throat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binghe closes his eyes and wraps his arms around Shizun tightly, and Shizun exhales in relief.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I have snacks I brought with breakfast,” Luo Binghe offers. “There aren’t many left, but Shizun is welcome to them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s a considering silence, and then Shizun counters, “We’ll share them.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright!” Luo Binghe exclaims, and nuzzles Shizun thoroughly before taking the mixed nuts, yutougao, and chunjuan that had been leftover and rearranging them so as to be acceptably presented to Shizun.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>As earlier, Shizun allows Luo Binghe to offer him the best tidbits, and even allows Luo Binghe to give Shizun bites of food directly from his chopsticks. Luo Binghe’s heart can’t help but flutter at each indirect kiss, and flutters even more as the marks of Luo Binghe’s affection darken and spread across Shizun’s skin. He’ll probably be sore tomorrow. And…and for the next few days. Perhaps Luo Binghe will try and make him stay in bed, so that Luo Binghe can thoroughly, ah, check up on him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Or perhaps simply never leave his side.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In his distraction, Luo Binghe almost hits Shizun’s eye with a bite of chunjuan, and decides it’s better to pay proper attention after that.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Although the food won’t last them for long, and the outside world will ultimately intrude when Luo Binghe goes to make them dinner, for now, Luo Binghe is content.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s even more content when Shizun laces their fingers together. “I know Binghe’s birthday isn’t over,” he says, “But…has Binghe enjoyed himself? This teacher…this teacher wishes very much for Binghe to have a good birthday. To know he is…wanted. Deeply wanted.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s the best birthday,” Luo Binghe blurts, clutching Shizun’s hands to his chest. “Shizun shouldn’t doubt himself in the least! Shizun is everything warm and kind and </span>
  <em>
    <span>good</span>
  </em>
  <span>!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Now, now,” Shizun scolds, cheeks flushes, and his gaze darts to the side. “Don’t get carried away. It’s enough to know that you feel cherished. Don’t make up such nonsense.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s not nonsense, but Luo Binghe has taxed Shizun enough. He decides that’s a battle to be fought another day. “Yes,” he swears. “Yes, Shizun.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good.”</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <span>~*~</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun can’t move the next morning. When Luo Binghe returns with breakfast, whistling cheerfully, Shizun groans and buries his head under a pillow. Luo Binghe doesn’t laugh at him—he would never be so uncouth or disrespectful—but he does have to press his fingers to his lips so he doesn’t make any unseemly noises that might cause Shizun to be upset with him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The scent of congee, with perfectly sliced green onions on top, eventually calls Shizun from the bed, however, and he emerges looking particularly disordered. His robe is in disarray, his hair standing on end, and there will be no disguising exactly what they did, repeatedly, for </span>
  <em>
    <span>hours</span>
  </em>
  <span> yesterday, especially not with Shizun’s throat practically black. Luo Binghe almost feels a little guilty; he didn’t mean to get so carried away.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But only </span>
  <em>
    <span>almost</span>
  </em>
  <span> guilty.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun winces as he sits across from Luo Binghe, even with the extra cushions Luo Binghe set down for him. He eyes Luo Binghe with resentment over his sunny demeanor and apparent good health, and narrows his eyes when Luo Binghe just placidly offers him tea.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you cook like that?” he asks suddenly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binghe glances down at himself, and his confusion clears as he realizes that he’s wearing the jade pendant Shizun gave him. “Of course,” he assures. “I had to let everyone know what a beautiful gift Shizun gave me, and it means I get to feel Shizun with me all the time.” He strokes it fondly, and Shizun’s eyes drop from Luo Binghe’s face to the gift.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That,” Shizun says, “is <em>not</em> what I was referring to.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binghe tilts his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you looked in a mirror?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binghe shakes his head, and Shizun closes his eyes and glances to the heavens as though asking for mercy, or a swift death, whichever comes faster. Luo Binghe immediately stands and inspects himself in the mirror, mouth dropping open as he observes the damage.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Luo Binghe’s throat is not as bad as Shizun’s, but only barely. He touches one of the deepest bruises, marveling at the sting of pain. There is even one directly beneath his ear in the almost perfect shape of a heart, and with Luo Binghe’s hair up in a ponytail, it’s framed by his waves in a way that makes it all look completely and utterly deliberate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Like he’s showing them off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun had marked him well, and when Luo Binghe touches his fingers to Shizun’s pendant, feeling Shizun’s energy twining around him, he beams.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You love me!” he cries. “You really, really love me!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shizun covers his face and moans, but Luo Binghe doesn’t let that stop him from nearly knocking Shizun to the floor in his effort to—well.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>To eat well today, too.</span>
