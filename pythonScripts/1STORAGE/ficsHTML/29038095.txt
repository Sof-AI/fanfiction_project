    <p>Philza was having a <em>normal</em> morning. Normal was a relative term, of course,when you were the father of a moody 20-year-old genius, his (adopted) piglin hybrid twin, and their younger brother, who was a (lovable) menace, not to mention his best friend who was practically a fourth kid.</p><p>With a family like that, the house was always loud. Of course, it had quieted in some in the last few years, as kids matured and moved on (and while quiet was nice, he would lie if he said he sometimes didn’t miss the noise). Technoblade was spending more and more time away from home- hell, Phil hadn’t seen his eldest son in almost a year, and he hadn’t written in almost a month. He was busy, off doing Ender knows what, though Phil thought he’d mentioned something about potato farming in his rare, brief letters. That was better than bloodshed, at least, he supposed.</p><p>He just hoped his son was safe. As much as he joked about Wilbur being an adult and still living at home, Phil was more than happy for his children to stay with him so that he knew they were safe and cared for. He hadn’t denied Technoblade’s request to leave, but he often wished his oldest hadn’t left the moment he turned 16. (part of him had wanted to follow, to care for his most unstable son, but Wilbur was still just sixteen at the time and Tommy only 10. Maybe one day, when Tommy was 15 or 16 himself…)</p><p>Regardless, he was having a normal morning, for him. Phil had already tended the cows and horses, ensuring they were fed. He cleared a few trees about a mile from the house, so that the fire would stay warm and cheery, and melt the freshly fallen snow from their boots.</p><p>He’d woken Wilbur when he came in, and sent him off to do his usual chores and had spent the last hour or so cutting up potatoes, carrots, and fresh beef for the stew he was making for lunch. It wasn’t much, but with the cold of early winter settling it, it would taste good and warm them up at midday, which was rapidly approaching.</p><p>Wilbur should have already been finished with his chores but was likely working on a song instead, singing to Maria, their oldest sheep. Phil didn’t care, as long as he cleaned up the barn at some point.</p><p>Tommy, on the other hand, was still sleeping. Normally Phil wouldn’t allow Tommy to sleep so far into the day. It was wasteful when there was always so much to do and see, but Phil felt a little guilty. He and Tommy had been out clearing trees a ways from their house the day before where they were planning to create a bee farm. Phil was lost in his work and Tommy was being helpful but was also having fun pretending to fight imaginary mobs with swords and Phil hadn’t been paying enough attention. It edged a little too close to dark before they started home and the real mobs came out.</p><p>Tommy could hold his own against zombies and creepers rather well, but an Enderman, of all things, had appeared. Phil could still remember the slight squawk of fear his youngest had made, causing Phil to turn from the baby zombie he’d just killed, only to Find an Enderman looming over his youngest, shaking with rage.</p><p>Phil didn’t remember much of what happened in the next few minutes. The next thing he knew, he was standing over the Enderman’s fading body, his trusty netherite sword glistening in his hand, wings thrown wide as Tommy cowered behind him.</p><p>Tommy was really too heavy to carry while flying, but Phil could see he was shaking, and damn it, his son had almost died, right in front of him, Phil wasn’t sure if his hands or Tommy’s were shaking worse as they clung to one another on the flight home.</p><p>The 14-year-old pretended he wasn’t scared when they got back. He told Wilbur that he was a ‘big man’ and that he’d almost had the Enderman down when Phil stole his kill. Phil hadn’t called him out on it and Wilbur hadn’t either after a stern look from Phil. They would play along, but Phil knew Tommy was far more shaken than he was willing to admit. Tommy hadn’t strayed more than a few feet from him or Wilbur the night before. Phil couldn’t help the cool guilt that pooled in his stomach at the idea that his son nearly died because of his own negligence. Tommy acted so brave Phil often forgot he was nearly 8 years younger than his siblings, with far less experience than them. So, he let Tommy sleep.</p><p>But, it was approaching noon and Tommy needed to get up, at least to eat. Perhaps Phil would send Wilbur over to fetch Tubbo- the boy was probably all alone in that house anyway. Tubbo’s father was dead and his mother hardly counted as such- Tubbo spent more time at their house than at his own. Phil didn’t mind, especially since the quiet boy could be such a good influence on Tommy. Well, when Tommy wasn’t being a bad influence on him.</p><p>So Phil allowed the soup to simmer over the fire as he rose up on his feet. His knees twinged a little, stiff after kneeling for so long. Phil certainly wasn’t old, by any means, especially not by hybrid standards, but his body had taken quite a bit of abuse over the last 20 years of fatherhood.</p><p>Phil trudged up the steps to the second floor where all of his son’s bedrooms were. Tommy’s was at the end of the hall and the door was cracked open just enough that Phil could see a small tuft of blonde hair peeking out from under the blankets. He smiled softly. Tommy looked peaceful like that, unlike he did any time he was awake. Phil loved his youngest, but Tommy could be a right menace, especially now that he’d just caught on to swear words. He just… needed a little guidance.</p><p>Tommy was usually a heavy sleep and it sometimes required Phil to practically drag him from bed. If he ever let Technoblade or Wilbur wake Tommy up, there was often water involved. He expected today to be much the same, especially since it had been on into the night before Tommy dozed off on the couch, and Wilbur had carried him up to his bed and tucked him in. Tommy would have protested if he hadn’t been so soundly asleep.</p><p>Phil, however, only had to open the door and take a single step in for Tommy to wake up. Tommy shot straight up in bed, looking around wildly before his eyes finally landed on Phil. The look on Tommy’s face froze Phil for a moment. Tommy’s bright blue eyes were wild and blown wide with what looked like sheer terror. His breathing was unsteady and gasping. Tommy was terrified. Phil’s heart wrenched.</p><p>“No,” Tommy murmured shaking his head slightly, though he had yet to look away from Phil, “oh fuck no. Oh no. Oh shit.”</p><p>That snapped Phil out of his trance. Tommy was terrified- probably still trapped in a nightmare about the Enderman. He couldn't be seeing his room and certainly wasn’t seeing Phil. Tommy was trapped in a nightmare and Phil was stuck watching on the outside. “Tommy,” Phil said softly, taking a step towards his son, hand out, ready to pull him into a hug “Tommy, it’s-”</p><p>Tommy flinched back violently, pressing against the wall “Don’t come any fucking closer.” Tommy shouted suddenly, startling Phil into stepping back. Tommy was still looking around wildly, like a trapped animal “Don’t fucking do it.”</p><p>Tommy had already started picking up curse words from Wilbur and Techno, but the absolute filth spilling from his mouth was unusual even for him. But Tommy was obviously scared, so Phil didn’t try to press closer.</p><p>“Tommy what-”</p><p>Tommy paled even further, completely ignoring Phil’s words as he started to ramble loudly “Oh Ender, if you’re here, Technoblade isn’t far behind. Or are you supposed to bring me to him? I’m not going. I-I won't let you take me Philza- I-I’ll fucking kill you.” Tommy’s eyes wandered back to Phil who was frozen on the spot. There was rage intermingled in that fear. What was his son seeing? What was his son thinking?</p><p>“ I won’t hesitate.” Tommy spat. He pulled his weak wooden sword out of his inventory- he must not have taken it out last night. Phil thought distantly, that he would normally admonish Tommy for that, because it could be dangerous, waking up and being able to pull out a weapon. But Tommy seemed to know exactly what he was doing, with that sword, pointed with an eerily steady hand at Phil “ I-I don’t want to but I will! I need to get out of here. Fuck I’m in deep shit. He is going to fucking kill me, he’s going to kill me or send me to-” Tommy made a choked noise that sounded like sheer panic, and Phil’s stomach twisted in fear for his son. Something was wrong.</p><p>Phil wasn't sure if Tommy was talking to him or just himself, but regardless, what he was saying made no sense. Tommy hadn’t seen his older brother in nearly a year, and not regularly for 4. They two had been close when Tommy was little but Techno couldn’t always handle him, especially not on bad days, when the chat was too loud. But nothing, nothing should have garnered this reaction. What sort of nightmare had he had?</p><p>“Tommy, please, calm-”</p><p>Tommy, however, didn’t seem to hear him, or maybe just didn’t care. Phil wasn’t sure what Tommy was even seeing. Before Phil could react Tommy was out of bed and vaulting across the small room. It took a moment to realize what he was doing, but by then it was too late. Phil dove for him, desperately trying to grab his son, but his hands only brushed the back of Tommy’s shirt. Phil gaped in horror as his son crashed through the glass panes of the window, breaking it with only his body. Phil scrambled to his feet, from where he’d crashed to the floor, and ran to the small window. “Tommy!” he shouted out into the cold morning air as ice spread up his spine, but he only caught a glimpse of blonde vanishing into the dense wood that sprawled around their house.</p><p>----</p><p>The window wasn’t big enough for Phil to fly out of and he cursed that design flaw as he ran down the steps. He paused only long enough to pull on his boots and stormed out the door. Every second wasted was a second that Tommy was doing Ender knows what. Every second was one more towards nightfall. Phil’s hands didn’t shake, but it was only years of fighting that kept them steady.</p><p>“Dad?” Wilbur was just outside the door, guitar in hand “I heard a crash. Is everything ok?”</p><p>“Tommy’s gone,” Phil said shortly, trying not to let the cold panic that clutched at his heart seep into his voice. He needed to keep a level head, for Tommy and for Wilbur. He needed Wilbur to keep it together. He needed his eyes. “I went to wake him up and he panicked, talking out of his head. He jumped out the window before I realized what he was even doing.”</p><p>“What? Out the window? Is he okay?” Wilbur asked, concern leaking into his tone “Why-”</p><p>“Will, I don’t know.” He snapped “I need you to help me find him. I’m taking to the sky, I need you on the ground. Tommy went north- try and follow his tracks. Take a sword and be careful. Signal me if you find him or if you need me.”</p><p>Wilbur looked panicked but Phil didn’t have time to coddle him, not now, not when it was cold, snowing, and inching towards nightfall. Tommy would never last all night against the mobs, not with only a wooden sword. . He simply clapped a hand on Will’s shoulder and said “Be careful, son.” Then he unfurled his dark wings and took off into the skies.</p><p>---<br/>
Tommy was running. He had no fucking clue what else he could do. His weapons were gone. His armour was gone. Even his food, his meagre potatoes, and bread were taken. He had nothing but the stupid wooden sword that he didn’t even remember making, let alone why he would clear his inventory for it. Phil had probably fucking taken it.</p><p>All he knew was that he was in a strange room, with his dad, no Philza standing over him. And wasn’t that just fucking great? Phil was almost as bad as Technoblade, if not worse in the whole ‘hating his guts’ thing. He didn’t know if Phil would kill him or not, but the only reason that Phil would be anywhere near him these days would be if Technoblade asked him to. And after everything that happened, well, Techno would want nothing more than to run Tommy through with a sword. He made that clear the day he blew up L’Manburg. He knew that even before he’d betrayed Technoblade.</p><p>Tommy thought he was relatively safe where he was, despite 90% of the SMP hating him, he was almost certain Phil and Techno hadn’t been hunting him. But, apparently, he was wrong. He must’ve wandered too far into the woods, (though he couldn't really remember anything from the last few days) and wandered into Philza’s fucking hut.</p><p>He had vaguely recognized the house, but couldn’t place it. He hadn’t exactly studied it either, not when he woke up to Philza standing over him. No, there was only time to try and get the fuck out, like every instinct was screaming at him to do.</p><p>The landscape he wasn’t as far north as Techno’s farm, but there was still snow on the ground and a chill in the air. He thought he’d been there before but again-he only had time to run- he couldn't be bothered to study the fucking tress. Besides, Tommy couldn't focus. His head ached almost as much as his body and everything was… fuzzy. Wrong. He just needed to get away. He had to fucking hide, before Phil could find him. Tommy, despite what people thought, really didn’t want to die.</p><p>His inventory was pitiful, but he had a wooden sword and an old pickax. That would be enough to create a dugout and a few small torches. IT wasn’t much but it was enough to survive the night. It had to be.</p><p>Tommy wasn’t sure how far he’d gotten but it probably wasn't far enough, especially if Phil got desperate enough to take to the skies. He didn’t know if he would risk Dream’s wrath by flying though. But, his feet ached and despite how much he’d run recently, he was already winded. His sides ached and his legs struggled to keep under him. How was he so out of shape?</p><p>Tommy finally had to stop. He didn't want to. He would die if he did, at the hands of Phil or Techno, but if he kept going the snow would get him first. Maybe Techno Would make it quick? His aching body wouldn’t let him go another step as it stood- not if he wanted a shelter.</p><p>. Tommy forced himself to stay upright, as he stumbled against the side of a rock wall. Something about it was familiar, like everything else, but Tommy wasn’t sure what. He didn’t care. The area wasn’t ideal but he couldn’t bring himself to try and craft. He swung his pickaxe, forcing his shaking arms to dig a shallow dugout on the side of the rock wall. It was tiny, only a few blocks wide and two tall, but it was enough. It would keep the zombies out. He lit one of his torches and rebuilt the wall. He hated staring at the blank stone wall in front of him, too much like Pogtopia and all those weeks without sunlight, but he couldn’t afford to be caught. And he was tired. He was so fucking tired.</p><p>Tommy shivered against the cold stone rock wall. He needed to stay awake, just in case Phil managed to find his hideout, needed to be ready to fight, but he was cold. And tired, and everything felt wrong. Tommy was sure that he could figure it out if only he could focus, but everything was fuzzy and fading fast.</p><p>Maybe a nap would help, Tommy thought distantly, a nap sounded nice.</p>
