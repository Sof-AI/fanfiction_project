    <p>When it came to negotiating the marriage of Jiang Yanli and Jin Zixuan, Meng Yao was essential only insofar as his calligraphy remained infallible even under the greatest pressure. And such pressure there was. Not necessarily from the representatives sent by the Two Lords to discuss terms, though they were both obviously accomplished negotiators who took their roles very seriously, but from the insouciant black shadow lounging next to the window across the room. </p>
<p>Wei Wuxian, the only family representative in the room, had everyone guessing. On the one hand, if rumour were to be believed, Sect Leader Jiang rarely left the Unclean Realm since the end of the Sunshot Campaign, an unspoken edict he maintained even in the event of commencing negotiations for his own sister’s marriage contract. On the other hand, Wei Wuxian was her adopted brother, and older than Sect Leader Jiang, though not included in the line of succession. With the major sects still recovering from the Sunshot Campaign, he was probably the one one in any position to represent the interests of the Yunmeng Jiang. And yet he had not said a word the entire morning, save for the brief greeting he’d offered upon arrival. If he did plan to make any procolomations, he’d decided to bide his time. </p>
<p>Meng Yao visibly kept his attention on the scroll before him, following along with the proceedings as closely as humanly possible and with as much detail as possible. It wouldn’t do for anything to be missed, after all, especially not certain clauses that needed to be included, though his father obviously considered them not worth mentioning. An oversight, considering the dignity and prestige of the woman in question, not to mention her… extensive collection of allies. </p>
<p>(It was not an oversight—when the negotiators had mentioned the standard considerations of a marriage contract between equally dignified sects, Jin Guangshan had chuckled and waved a hand and easily conceded, but with a pointed look towards Meng Yao that suggested certain articles be best forgotten. Meng Yao had included them regardless of Jin Guangshan’s  disapproval. The negotiators would be the ones reviewing the document first and omitting them would make Meng Yao look incompetent at best. While there was little in the way that Meng Yao would not allow to win his father’s favour, he drew the line at being seen as incompetent. His aggressive competence was all he had.)</p>
<p>They had been going back and forth little over two hours before a halt for refreshments was called, and Meng Yao was excused to organize the necessary arrangements. He slipped out a discreet side door reserved for servants and made his way down the narrow hallways towards the kitchens. </p>
<p>He emerged in the family courtyard, only to be immediately accosted by an unwelcome voice shouting at him from across the way. </p>
<p>“Meng Yao!” </p>
<p>He closed his eyes a moment in search of inner fortitude, and then turned with a pleasant smile. “Jin Zixun.” He bowed slightly lower than called for, hoping the deference would save him from whatever Jin Zixun wanted of him. </p>
<p>“Any word on the dragons yet?” </p>
<p>Meng Yao’s smile remained frozen in place, even as his gut churned unpleasantly. “Dragons, cousin?” </p>
<p>As expected, Jin Zixun’s face contorted in fury. He fisted a hand in the front of Meng Yao’s robes and pulled him close. “Cousin?” he repeated with a hiss. “You dare speak to me as though we are kin?”</p>
<p>“My apologies,” Meng Yao replied evenly. He aspired to remain neutral in such situations, no matter how frequently they occurred. If anything, it drove Jin Zixun even more furious, from which Meng Yao derived a lot of personal satisfaction.  “I was acting under the assumption that the child of one’s uncle was typically referred to as ‘cousin.’” </p>
<p>“My Uncle hasn’t acknowledged you. The only reason you’re even here is because Zixuan is an idiot.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao sharpened his gaze. “And likewise, Jin Zixuan is the only reason these negotiations are even taking place. Perhaps it might behoove you to remember that, in case he were to overhear you offering him such disrespect.” </p>
<p>Jin Zixun scowled. “Will you answer my question?” </p>
<p>“What question was that?”</p>
<p>“<em>About the dragons</em>!” He shook Meng Yao’s robes, the sudden violent jerk whipping Meng Yao’s neck to the side and pulling the muscles in his neck. He shoved down an undignified sound of pain, bottling it up within his chest as he had every other assault to which he’d been subjected since coming to Koi Tower. </p>
<p>A dagger, such as the one currently concealed within his robes, could put a quick stop to the abuse. His aim with the blade was impeccable; his mother had insisted. He knew exactly where to drive the blade to cripple, to kill, or merely emphasize a point. And for all he clutched those fantasies desperately to his breast, he never acted upon them. Not when his position in Koi Tower remained one of servitude. </p>
<p>Meng Yao fondly thought about the bouncers at the brothel, and their willingness to remove clients who spoke to the women with such disrespect. “At this time, discussions have not reached any considerations of dowry.” </p>
<p>Jin Zixun grimaced in annoyance. “Why not?” </p>
<p>“When the parties involved are gentry, these things take longer.” </p>
<p>Another haughty huff of displeasure. “Maybe I’ll sit in this afternoon.”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe you were invited to attend proceedings, Jin Zixun.” </p>
<p>“I’m the second heir, I do what I want.” </p>
<p>Alas, in Koi Tower, such was the truth of matters. </p>
<p>“If you’d care to join them, then, we are taking a small recess while I arrange for food and drink. I will ensure there is enough for you to partake as well.” </p>
<p>Jin Zixun nodded brusquely. “Good.” He turned on his heel and strode away, rounding the courtyard to approach the meeting room from the family entrance instead. Meng Yao watched him go with no small measure of relief. Nothing had ended in real violence, this time. </p>
<p>“Meng Yao?” </p>
<p>This time, he couldn’t help a roll of his eyes, but at least he was positioned in such a way that it wasn’t observable. At this rate, he’d need to arrange for dinner instead. </p>
<p>When he turned around to face Jin Zixuan, his smile was back in place, composure regained. “Jin Zixuan. I apologize—have I tarried too long? Only, the courtyard is so beautiful.” It was not. The flowers were all transplants from outside Lanling, withering under the oppressive atmosphere of Koi Tower. The gardeners all despaired of succeeding where their frequently replaced predecessors could not.</p>
<p>Jin Zixuan appeared troubled. “Was Zixun bothering you again?” </p>
<p>“I’m certain I don’t know what you mean.” ‘Bothering’ couldn’t be the word, surely, for unrelenting, escalating harassment. Meng Yao’s only reliable shield was forged in and maintained by the strength of his words. </p>
<p>His half-brother’s face drew in consternation, one of his more reliable expressions. “I had thought they would stop, once you proved your worth.” </p>
<p>“My worth is only in that I am a faithful servant to your father.” </p>
<p>The furrow in Jin Zixuan’s brow deepend at the word ‘servant,’ though he did not argue. “Is he always this bad?” </p>
<p>Meng Yao declined to answer; there was nothing he could give. </p>
<p>Frustrated, though Meng Yao could not decipher exactly why, Jin Zixuan shook his head, tossed his hair, and made his way back to the receiving chamber, finally allowing Meng Yao to make his way to the kitchens. Anticipating drawn-out proceedings, he had made earlier arrangements for slightly more substantial fare than one might typically receive between a midday meal and dinner, glad for it when it was presented to the room’s occupants, which now included Jin Zixun. He returned to the table he’d occupied earlier, the ink still drying on the scroll with the first of the clauses, and awaiting further additions. </p>
<p>Surprisingly, Jin Zixuan had moved from his seat at their father’s side. Instead, he had approached their silent guest, who had settled in with a jar of wine. Jin Zixuan whispered with low urgency, attention entirely affixed on Wei Wuxian, who seemed content to maintain his bored stare out the window, which Meng Yao suddenly realized looked out upon the courtyard below, likely having given him a full view of the altercation with Jin Zixun. How mortifying. </p>
<p>“What are you boys whispering about?” Jin Guangshan laughed as the remainder of the party reconvened, a demand carefully concealed in the grin rounding his cheeks. “Certainly nothing that can’t be shared among friends?” </p>
<p>Jin Zixuan turned back and bowed his head, but gave no answer. Wei Wuxian did not bother with acknowledging father at all. Dangerous and stupid, Meng Yao decided. Already a reputation Wei Wuxian carried with him from the war, though he’d seen little proof of either before now. Dangerous to ignore a man as powerful as Sect Leader Jin, stupid to offer insult to the man who would eventually be his sister’s father-in-law. </p>
<p>“Nothing worth mentioning,” Jin Zixuan replied easily, retaking his seat. </p>
<p>Meng Yao blinked, though he did not raise his head. Had… Jin Zixuan just <em>lied</em>? It was smooth, though not effortless in the way Meng Yao deceived the world around him. There was something in his turn of phrase, a deliberate lightness in his words Meng Yao had never heard from his half-brother before. There was no way their father hadn’t noticed—Jin Zixuan was too unpracticed at deception. </p>
<p>Except Jin Guangshan merely chuckled again and applied himself to his cups. “Excellent, then. Shall we proceed?” </p>
<p>Negotiations turned to matters of the wedding itself. It would, of course, be hosted from the Unclean Realm. Regardless of the resources and pretentious magnificence of Lanling, the Unclean Realm had emerged from the Sunshot Campaign as the unequivocal seat of power in their world. It had been requested, and granted, that Jin Zixuan would depart with the negotiators to live there year prior to the actual wedding, to ensure harmony between himself and Jiang Yanli, and give them both a chance to escape the marriage unimpeded if they proved ill-suited to one another. An unusual arrangement, but something to which Jin Guangshan had been obligated to agree before the negotiations even commenced. He’d spent the two years since the end of the Sunshot Campaign pursuing this marriage; by the time the Two Lords agreed to discuss it, he might have agreed to far more. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, neither of the Two Lords were present to curb Jin Guangshan’s obvious ambitions. </p>
<p>“And then, of course, they will return to Koi Tower for their married lives.” </p>
<p>The sound of a wine jar being settled on the windowsill was deafening in the ensuing silence. “No.” Wei Wuxian had a sweet, clear voice that might’ve dripped with actual human shit for all the response it received from Jin Guangshan. His father whipped around to look at the young man, whose eyes had finally turned from the courtyard to the proceedings with every indication that he had been attentive the entire time. Meng Yao decided it was better to err on the side of giving the other man the benefit of the doubt. After all, it was his sister involved. He’d spoken up now that something of matter had been said. </p>
<p>“No?” Jin Zixun repeated. “How dare you say no!” </p>
<p>Unmoved, Wei Wuxian maintained strict eye contact with Jin Guangshan. “My sister and her husband will live out their days in the Unclean Realm, with the rest of our House.” </p>
<p>The Household of the Two Lords. The words hadn’t been bandied about before now, though it rested under the surface of the proceedings; a dangerously sharpened rock hidden by otherwise gentle currents. </p>
<p>“My son is my heir,” Jin Guangshan stated, all levity drained from his voice. “How is he expected to learn the statesmanship required to rule Lanling if he is not in Koi Tower?” </p>
<p>Wei Wuxian stepped towards the table, and as one the negotiators shifted to allow him a spot between them. He settled down easily, resting his sword beside him and drawing his black dizi into his lap, giving Meng Yao the briefest glimpse of the white jade sword token hanging from the end. </p>
<p>Wei Wuxian’s mouth twisted into an affectedly confused moue. “Are you suggesting Sect Leader Jiang is an ineffective ruler, when he remains in the Unclean Realm?” </p>
<p>Meng Yao revised his opinion: dangerous, yes but not stupid. </p>
<p>His father had maneuvered himself into an untenable position with limited options. He might continue to press his point and offer grievous offense by insulting the Household’s youngest ruling member. He could back down and lose face before a man who, despite being a war hero and member of the Household of the Two Lords, remained the subject of frequent whispers about his low parentage. Or he could dismiss negotiations all together and waste away for want of what the Two Lords might offer him personally in terms of prestige and… other considerations. </p>
<p>“Perhaps we might find a compromise,” Meng Yao offered. All eyes turned to him. He had been judicious in his suggestions before now, and made them sparingly. “No one can argue that Sect Leader Jiang governs Yunmeng effectively and fairly. However, he also has the advantage of a very effective regent in Yu Ziyuan, who is more than capable of overseeing small matters in his absence, which is a luxury that will not be afforded to Jin Zixuan in the hopefully far-off event of his assumption of power. Perhaps, if it would be acceptable to everyone, Jin Zixuan and Jiang Yanli might be able to consider the Unclean Realm as their primary residence, with frequent visits to and from Koi Tower throughout the year to allow the heir to remain abreast of the local situation.” </p>
<p>The negotiators looked at Wei Wuxian for approval, further driving home Meng Yao’s decision that despite his silence, the other man had always been the one fully in charge of the situation. Though there was no obvious acknowledgment, the younger of the negotiators turned back to Meng Yao. “How frequent?” </p>
<p>A reasonable schedule was quickly decided upon, which Meng Yao dutifully recorded in its entirety. </p>
<p>Before Wei Wuxian could return to his position at the window, Jin Guangshan decided on another sweeping declaration. </p>
<p>“I must say, when I entered this discussion, it was not with an eye for giving up my only son and heir.” A deliberate jab, since Meng Yao had only managed to argue for three months of the year for the married couple. Meng Yao let the pain of the words flow through and out of him. They didn’t matter. Jin Zixuan stiffened, but before he could speak, their father continued, “Perhaps, now, you might be willing to give up something in return?”</p>
<p>In the ensuing, icy silence, Meng Yao set down his brush. </p>
<p>“My uncle is right,” Jin Zixun continued. “With my cousin going to the Unclean Realm, we lose one of our greatest warriors and most important members of the clan.” Less than a week ago, Jin Zixun had been whining into a cup of wine about what a useless shit he considered Jin Zixuan to be. Meng Yao had overheard the servants speaking of it, and doubtless his half-brother had heard the same based on the cutting look he slid towards Jin Zixun. Something between them had changed during the Sunshot Campaign, though Meng Yao had only heard about it as passing gossip, with nothing in the way of confirmed details. He wasted little mental capacity on it; the war had changed everyone. </p>
<p>“Come to your point,” Wei Wuxian said flatly. </p>
<p>Jin Zixun smirked. “A dragon seems a fair exchange.”</p>
<p>Wei Wuxian’s hand hitting the table seemed to echo in the very air outside Koi Tower, as though he’d bottled thunder and collected it in his palm. “ Dragons aren’t fucking livestock. We do not barter with their lives.” </p>
<p>“Did Nie Mingjue and Lan Xichen not ride them into battle?” Jin Zixun demanded, “As I rode a horse?”</p>
<p>This was the moment where it all fell apart, Meng Yao decided. Jin Zixun’s unique brand of aggressive stupidity would not be forgiven. If he even lived. From the way Wei Wuxian’s hand twisted on his sword’s hilt, there was a chance he’d be dead any second. Would already be dead if Wei Wuxian had the power to kill with his gaze alone. </p>
<p>“Dragons are our honoured equals,” Wei Wuxian snarled out through his teeth. “If they bear a rider, it is of their own volition, and not because they are in any way commanded.”</p>
<p>Zixun, heedless of the danger he was in—on dual fronts, as it seemed that Jin Guangshan was likely to do further violence if this fell through—prepared to reply. </p>
<p>Meng Yao stood. “I’m sure the misunderstanding is on our part, Young Master Wei,” he insisted. Hard eyes turned his way, set in an implacably outraged face. “Our understanding of dragons is limited without exposure to them. We only know of them as creatures of supreme majesty, and did not understand them to be as closely tied to the Household of the Two Lords as you’ve explained. We humbly beg your pardon for our ignorance.” He stood and bowed as deeply as he could without dropping to his knees and pressing his forehead to the floor. If Wei Wuxian would not accept the apology, that would come next. Groveling needed to be approached in steps if it was to be effective; once you were on the floor, there was nowhere else to go.</p>
<p>“A misunderstanding, is it?” Wei Wuxian demanded. The threat of unsatisfied desire for violence stuck in Meng Yao’s throat.</p>
<p>“Of course, Young Master Wei. The Lanling Jin would never offer intentional offense to such distinguished persons, especially not when looking to unify our families.” </p>
<p>There was a short huff of breath. Not haughty, as it might have been from Jin Guangshan or his contingent, but one of a gentler nature, though Meng Yao would hesitate to term it as appeased. </p>
<p>“Fine,” Wei Wuxian finally bit out. “But there will be no more talk, or mention, of the dragons during the course of these talks.” </p>
<p>“Of course, of course. I’m glad we’ve clarified the matter,” Jin Guangshan agreed. </p>
<p>Appeased or not, Jin Zixun’s misstep—likely made at the behest of Jin Guangshan to avoid making the request himself—had drawn Wei Wuxian fully to the table, and Meng Yao had little doubt he would make the rest of negotiations ruthless on behalf of his sister in recompense. He could have been satisfied with the resolutions of the negotiators, if Jin Zixun had not offered such grievous offense. The Lanling Jin would doubtless be made to pay for the trespass.</p>
<p>They did not break for dinner until late in the evening, and even then it was a painfully short meal hastily consumed before returning to the discussion. As expected, Wei Wuxian now fought for his sister the way he had reputedly fought in the Sunshot Campaign: gaining only small inches of ground before a stroke of brilliance maneuvered everything to his satisfaction and he fully claimed the field. His logic was impeccable, and Meng Yao watched with no small interest as he wove a brilliant net around Jin Guangshan with a cunning approach to each point until it seemed likely that the Jin Sect would beggar its coffers to pay for every concession made for the honour of calling Jiang Yanli its mistress. </p>
<p>Meng Yao did what he could to curtail some of the aggravation now leaking through every clause as it became a new battlefield to be won. His father’s negotiators were unaccustomed to anyone arguing with such ruthless efficiency, formerly having enjoyed being the ones with all the leverage. He stepped in more and more, until it became almost exclusively a conversation between him and Wei Wuxian. A surprisingly entertaining one, Meng Yao had to admit. The qualities he prized in himself shifted and reformed into a complementary reflection instead of a direct echo, and it made for a stimulating mental exercise. </p>
<p>He’d paused to commit the last agreement to paper when Wei Wuxian fell abruptly silent. Meng Yao glanced up through his lashes, and caught the tail end of a significant look passed between Jin Zixuan and Wei Wuxian. Wei Wuxian slumped in his seat, his perfect posture crumpling into equable agreeability. </p>
<p>“That’s all, I think,” Wei Wuxian concluded. The very room itself seemed poised to sigh in relief before he straightened and, as an afterthought, tossed out a casual, “Your seneschal is very capable. I’ve appreciated him more with each word.” </p>
<p>It took Meng Yao an embarrassingly long moment to realize Wei Wuxian was speaking about him. </p>
<p>“Meng Yao?” Jin Zixun scoffed. “He’s nothing.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao plastered on his most guileless expression and bowed in his seat. “Your words are too kind, Young Master Wei.”</p>
<p>Wei Wuxian considered him a moment before turning his attention back to Jin Guangshan. “‘Nothing?’ I think you should review the contract and look for all the ways he’s managed to keep Koi Tower on even ground with the Unclean Realm and Yunmeng.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao appreciated that Wei Wuxian was trying to compliment him, but he silently and fervently wished for the other man to shut the fuck up. When he reviewed the contract, all Jin Guangshan would see were the places where Meng Yao had failed to secure Koi Tower the advantage; equal ground would never be an acceptable state of affairs. His retrenchments might have saved the marriage, but it had failed in every other way Jin Guangshan would consider important. </p>
<p>“His administrative uses are often outweighed by the demands he places on my patience,” Jin Guangshan stated. </p>
<p>Meng Yao kept smiling. Needed to keep smiling. He was not a legitimate son, to argue his own virtues. He lived as a servant, unfit to wear the vermillion mark or hold himself up as an equal to those around him. His father frequently dangled legitimization before him as a prize to be won at the cost of his dignity, and while Meng Yao hoped the offers to be sincere, they would not come without a price he’d long ago decided to pay sight unseen. </p>
<p>Wei Wuxian’s lips twisted into a poor imitation of a smile. “Oh? That’s a shame. If you don’t want him, we’ll take him.” </p>
<p>Probably wise Meng Yao had put down his brush, as the statement would have doubtless led to him dropping it and ruining the contract entirely. </p>
<p>Jin Guangshan’s face twisted in confusion. “Why?” The echo of Jin Zixun’s declaration of ‘he’s nothing’ sat heavy in the air. </p>
<p>Wei Wuxian smirked. “Our House appreciates quality wherever it is found.”</p>
<p>“Let them take him, uncle,” Jin Zixun sniffed. “He was always going to end up serving someone in the same capacity as his mother.” </p>
<p>Jin Zixuan rounded on him, but before he could speak, Jin Guangshan’s arm swept through the air. “Now you want both of my sons?” </p>
<p>“Oh, I apologize, Sect Leader Jin, but I believe earlier you said you had only one son and heir. And if his ‘administrative uses are often outweighed by his demands on your patience,’ then won’t I truly be doing you a service in removing him?” Meng Yao paid close attention to Wei Wuxian’s appearance of innocent misunderstanding. Partly because it hurt less than acknowledging to himself what he’d always believed regarding his father’s opinions of him. Partly because it was a truly admirable bit of acting, and Meng Yao thought it a useful expression to have perfected.</p>
<p>He did not anticipate his father ceding the notion. ‘Administrative uses’ was a paltry description of the enormous amount of work Meng Yao did on his father’s behalf, and he’d successfully insinuated himself into almost every aspect of Koi Tower’s daily functions. He rose earlier than anyone, and retired later. He’d taken over the roles of six other individuals in the past year, and his father—while he didn’t appreciate anything else about him—at least understood his usefulness.</p>
<p>This time, Meng Yao decided, his father could muddle his own way out of it. </p>
<p>Except he didn’t. Either exhausted by the entire affair or, more likely, completely indifferent to Meng Yao’s fate, Jin Guangshan ordered him to enter himself into the contract. Meng Yao stared down at the page, jaw clenched. To be <em>given away</em> without any concessions to his value? Had he proved nothing of his usefulness to his father since coming to Koi Tower? </p>
<p>Jin Guangshan coughed pointedly and Meng Yao set brush to paper. He used simple language, as one might describe a single chicken bartered away as an afterthought. Doubtful his father would appreciate it, if he even noticed. </p>
<p>Evening concluded, Meng Yao stood and handed the contract to Wei Wuxian for review, ignoring his father’s call for a last look before it was delivered, and dismissed himself from the room. </p>
<p>It seemed he had to pack.</p><hr/>
<p>When Meng Yao had arrived at Koi Tower, he’d thought very highly of his chances of endearing himself to his father. Surely, after years of war, an unknown son emerging from the ashes like new life would be welcome. Meng Yao had dressed simply in the closest shade to yellow he could find, and walked up the steps with all the confidence of a man triumphantly returning home, a smiling mask already in place to hide everything from his nervous excitement to the anticipation in meeting father to whom he already owed such a great debt. </p>
<p>His trip back down the stairs had been much faster, and far less pleasant. His left knee still ached occasionally. He was well aware that, had things been even slightly less in his favour, he could have been permanently crippled. Killed, even. The Koi Tower stairs had more than a little blood soaked into the steps.. </p>
<p>Meng Yao had pushed himself up and dropped again immediately when he’d placed weight on his left leg. And suddenly there had been a hand under his elbow and a supportive arm to lean his weight against. He’d looked into a deeply concerned, conflicted face that hid itself behind an awkward inability to compose thoughts in such a way as to express them meaningfully. All of which Meng Yao read in that first, fleeting moment when his half-brother helped a complete stranger to his feet. </p>
<p>His first meeting with Jin Zixuan was defined by humiliation and pain and Meng Yao wasn’t sure he could forgive his half-brother the indignity of it. He’d been installed with war-worn healers and Jin Zixuan had somehow argued for him to be graced with the administrative position he’d come to enjoy. Almost. If he had managed to drag himself up and away from Koi Tower, disappeared into the night and found a way to create a name for himself perhaps his father would not now be sending him off as a bargaining chip for his brother’s wedding. </p>
<p>Meng Yao despised uncertainty. He understood himself to be a creature of intense preparation and deeply ingrained habits, all to his detriment as he knew next to nothing about the Household of the Two Lords save what was common knowledge. </p>
<p>During the Sunshot Campaign, the Two Lords had wed and consolidated their power and authority over their newly joined territory and then shown up to the battlefield astride <em>dragons</em> to win what should have been an unwinnable war. Lan Xichen, the Lord of Jade, was beautiful and possessed a brilliant tactical mind; Nie Mingjue, the Lord of Blades, fierce and formidable. They had collected warriors and rulers to their side in the aftermath, though without the fierce expansionist tendencies against which the war had been fought. </p>
<p>Meng Yao spent some idle time speculating on them after learning of Jin Zixuan’s intended betrothal. His half-brother somehow endeared himself to them during the uncertain period where Lanling had hesitated to engage, and came out of it on the other side with every assurance of a welcome suit if he pursued Jiang Yanli after she’d properly mourned the death of her father. </p>
<p>Frustratingly, Meng Yao knew nothing more. Jin Zixun’s suggestive words haunted him. What would they expect of him? A capable administrator? Surely the Household of the Two Lords already had those in scores. Something less seemly? The malice which had leaked from Wei Wuxian at the open insult to the dragons who lived alongside his family chilled his blood. Perhaps the insult itself was the reason Meng Yao would be brought along. Recompense could not be carved from the back of Jiang Yanli’s intended, after all. </p>
<p>His door opened without so much as a cursory knock, and Meng Yao straightened from where he’d crouched over his meagre collection of possessions as his father entered uninvited. He’d never been in Meng Yao’s room. Meng Yao was surprised he’d found it, tucked well back into the servant’s quarters.</p>
<p>“Meng Yao.”</p>
<p>He straightened, resenting the smile he had to plaster across his face. "Sect Leader Jin."</p>
<p>"Father," his father corrected. </p>
<p>Meng Yao's heart stuttered, traitorously hopeful. He’d never been invited to use such a personal address. Was this what he'd had to do to win his father's favour? Simply agree without argument to let himself be sent away and prove his unwavering obedience? He had left prior to the agreements being sealed, perhaps there had been a change at the last moment…</p>
<p>"You will leave with Zixuan in the morning." </p>
<p>Meng Yao inclined his head, resigned. "Of course."</p>
<p>"Being in the Unclean Realm will open up possibilities for you." </p>
<p>A surprisingly kind thing to say. And true, he realized. Koi Tower remained a powerhouse of the cultivation world, but the Unclean Realm? He would be potentially allowed access to the learning and knowledge of the incomparable library at Cloud Recesses. Dignitaries from all across the land visited the Unclean Realm. If Wei Wuxian spoke true and intended to bring Meng Yao along for his administrative capabilities, he might even endear himself to the Two Lords themselves. His father might not wish to acknowledge him, but perhaps this was the next best thing.</p>
<p>"You will find me a way to tame and control a dragon."</p>
<p>The swell of optimism, foolish and temporary as it had been, fled and left him cold and empty. "Sect Leader Jin?"</p>
<p>"Father," Jin Guangshan repeated with an oily smile. "You will be acting as Zixuan's servant, obviously. Do whatever they ask." He did not have to imagine the smirk tugging at his father's mouth. "Make yourself invaluable. Figure out where the dragons are being kept and find a way to bring one under my control."</p>
<p>"I…"</p>
<p>"Having a dragon will put us on equal footing with the Two Lords." The words caught on his teeth in a sneer of contempt.</p>
<p>"But surely the wedding to Jiang Yanli will afford you equal chances for advancement?"</p>
<p>"Are you suggesting a woman has the same value as a dragon." He shook his head and wagged a jovial finger. "Too much time spent at your mother's skirts, I think.” A frequent complaint, often repeated along with the regrettable similarity between Meng Yao’s eyes and his mother’s. “No. It must be a dragon.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao pressed his lips together, as though in thought. He needn’t think it out, he already saw exactly what the likelihood of success was. "And if they catch and kill me in the attempt?" ‘If’ was more than generous. </p>
<p>"Then I will have lost nothing." He placed a heavy hand on Meng Yao's shoulder. "But should you succeed, I will gain a son."</p>
<p>And a dragon, Meng Yao thought through his smile. They were both keenly aware of what mattered more.</p><hr/>
<p>Preparations for his departure took sadly little time. Everything he owned in the world tucked into a qiankun bag with room to spare. Jin Zixuan’s much more substantial collection of belongings took half a dozen men to move. When made his way to the stables the next morning, one of the Unclean Realm’s servants offered him a friendly smile and helped him atop a biddable dark bay mare quite a bit taller than anything he’d ever ridden before.</p>
<p>To the best of his knowledge, the Nie were still the predominant presence in the Unclean Realm. The Lan had yet to fully recover from the burning of Cloud Recesses. They’d been almost entirely wiped out before the Nie had arrived to offer what aid they could and inspired the Sunshot Campaign with a sweeping declaration denouncing Wen Ruohan’s unexpected attack. At the end of it, though Lan Xichen had joined his husband in the Unclean Realm, the Lan had almost entirely retreated into Gusu in favour of rebuilding themselves to their former prominence.</p>
<p>The Nie servants had only just finished packing when they were joined by Wei Wuxian and Jin Zixuan. And, behind them, Jin Guangshan to see them off personally. He met Meng Yao’s eyes and grinned as though the two of them shared a delicious joke before turning to bid farewell to his son. </p>
<p>“We will see you in the summer for the wedding,” he declared with a lusty clap to Jin Zixuan’s shoulder. </p>
<p>“Father,” Jin Zixuan said, bowing deferentially.</p>
<p>Wei Wuxian barely bowed before clamouring up onto a… donkey? </p>
<p>Noting the scrutiny he suddenly enjoyed from everyone gathered, save those he’d brought along with him, Wei Wuxian waved a hand. “I’d never subject a horse to my poor riding.” He dug his heels in and the old thing took off at a reasonable trot. </p>
<p>Meng Yao cast a confused look towards Jin Zixuan. The ride to the Unclean Realm would surely take a week, now, instead of merely a day or two. Jin Zixuan rolled his eyes, shrugged and spurred his own mount into action. </p>
<p>Meng Yao waited for the rest of their small company—Jin Zixuan, Wei Wuxian, the two negotiators and a handful of suspiciously well-armed servants—to precede him before following. He was obviously the lowest member of their party, with his recent… acquisition and uncertain place within the Unclean Realm. In truth, riding at the back didn’t bother him much. He’d slept poorly, and the chance to be alone with his thoughts was an unexpected reprieve. </p>
<p>Also, apparently a short-lived one. </p>
<p>They’d only just passed from the sight of Koi Tower when Wei Wuxian called for him. Meng Yao nudged his mount forward, thighs tightening at the sudden surge of speed as his horse cantered forward to catch up to the front of the group. Despite the donkey’s comparatively slow capabilities, Wei Wuxian had positioned himself at the front, and the group kept to his pace. </p>
<p>“Not used to being on horseback?” Wei Wuxian asked without a second’s thought to propriety or allowing Meng Yao the chance for a proper greeting. </p>
<p>“Not as such,” he replied. </p>
<p>Wei Wuxian laughed, open and genuine. “Me either. Haven’t been allowed on a horse since the war.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao pondered this a moment. “You do not enjoy riding?” </p>
<p>“I used to.” Wei Wuxian’s face was a fascinating landscape of open invitation to camaraderie and far too many obfuscations. “But you’ll find members of our House are fiercely particular in some respects. You can expect Zixuan to have his own ass when he returns to Koi Tower.” </p>
<p>Atop his horse, Jin Zixuan sniffed, but—interestingly—did not deny it. </p>
<p>“Anyway,” Wei Wuxian waved a hand, “You seem a very well-spoken and capable person. I have a mind to ask you some questions if you’re amenable.”</p>
<p>Meng Yao allowed a selfish moment to enjoy being back on familiar footing. “However I can be of service, Young Master Wei.” He doubted very much that the Two Lords desired any particular intel on the inner workings of Koi Tower—not when their dragons could presumably level a playing field completely—but he was prepared to give up incidental knowledge to gain favour with one of their most trusted men. </p>
<p>“Oh, none of that. We’re family, aren’t we?” He peered back over his shoulder. “Or we will be, if the Peacock doesn’t mess up his chances.” </p>
<p>“Wuxian,” Jin Zixuan said, chidingly. There was a… fond?... thrum in his voice. It suggested a closer relationship than Meng Yao had imagined. Of course they had fought together in the Sunshot Campaign, but he hadn’t been made aware of any particular familiarity or connection between them. It bore watching; Jin Guangshan wanted this match for political gain. There was no advantage to be had in anything of a more personal nature. </p>
<p>“I’m sure I don’t know what you mean,” Meng Yao protested. And he truly didn’t. Family? </p>
<p>Wei Wuxian hummed, a sly smile hiding in the corners of his mouth, but let it slip. “You strike me as very good at finding balance between opposing sides. Can I ask your opinion on a trade dispute we dealt with last year? Despite what Xichen-ge claims, I think we were cheated.” </p>
<p>He filed away the soft familiarity with which ‘Xichen-ge’ was spoken and nodded for Wei Wuxian to continue. </p>
<p>The day passed with surprising amicability between him and Wei Wuxian. Even Jin Zixuan offered his own insights once or twice, though Meng Yao noted with no small amount of personal pride that his half-brother often struggled to keep up. When Wei Wuxian finally called the evening’s halt, he grinned at Meng Yao ear-to-ear. </p>
<p>“You’ll do fine,” he claimed. With a complete lack of shamelessness, he squeezed Meng Yao’s arm in an overly familiar manner and moved to coordinate the set up of their small encampment. </p>
<p>This seemed very different from the Wei Wuxian who had attended the negotiations, and Meng Yao’s eyes narrowed for a moment as he tried to puzzle it out. </p>
<p>Another piece betrayed itself later that evening, after they’d set the watch. Supposedly unobserved, he caught sight of Jin Zixuan bowing to Wei Wuxian in a manner which seemed… grateful? He couldn’t see Wei Wuxian’s face, but Jin Zixuan certainly looked oddly relieved. Try as he might, he couldn’t fit it yet, and tucked it away for later examination.</p><hr/>
<p>As anticipated, the journey to the Unclean Realm took an unnecessarily long time. Surprisingly, no one complained—not even Jin Zixuan, of whose patience Meng Yao did not hold in high regard. It was… not unpleasant. Wei Wuxian was a far better conversationalist than literally anyone in Koi Tower and Meng Yao enjoyed the mental acrobatics to which their conversations treated him. It was diverting enough that he barely noticed when they passed into the territories of the Unclean Realm until the fortress itself appeared on the horizon. </p>
<p>Nothing—no paltry description or attempt at art—captured the Unclean Realm in its grandeur. Koi Tower, for all its beauty and grace, lacked the looming presence that pressed into Meng Yao’s bones as they approached. If Koi Tower was an elegant testament to beauty, the Unclean Realm was a mountainous ode sang on behalf of the natural world. It might as well have been carved from a mountain itself, stretching skyward taller than any other manmade monument might claim. </p>
<p>If they noticed the sudden hesitation in his horse’s step, they made no mention of it. </p>
<p>The gates to the Unclean Realm slid open to allow them entry, but Wei Wuxian paused before entering, waiting until Jin Zixuan fell into step with him. </p>
<p>And then, “Come on, Meng Yao!” </p>
<p>Swallowing down the queasiness in his belly, Meng Yao nudged his horse forward. This moment would clarify much of his uncertainty, he decided. It would be in how he was received by the Two Lords, how Wei Wuxian introduced him, how Jin Zixuan addressed him during these precious first encounters. His heart beat thrush-quick and he fought to maintain the pleasantly neutral composure he’d worked all his life to perfect.</p>
<p>“The Unclean Realm has a way of greeting honoured guests,” Wei Wuxian told him as they trotted forward. “You only have to agree if you want to. If you don’t, we’ll find another place for you.”</p>
<p>Before he could puzzle out Wei Wuxian’s meaning, the gates opened to a broad passage where they dismounted before stepping out into a wide courtyard. On the opposite side, spaced out on a much shallower flight of stairs than to which Meng Yao was accustomed, waited two men and a woman. Meng Yao braced himself to meet the Two Lords, and faltered in surprise when he recognized Sect Leader Jiang awaiting them instead, obvious in his personal heraldry and the colours of Yunmeng Jiang. His sister, Jiang Yanli, stood to his right, but to his left… </p>
<p>Meng Yao, mind swirling in panic at the sudden wrong-footedness, did not recognize the other man at all. Dressed in white, and wearing the traditional ribbon of the Lan, he might’ve been the Lord of Jade, but he stood lower than Sect Leader Jiang. </p>
<p>They came to a halt, and Meng Yao and Jin Zixuan dropped into deferential bows. </p>
<p>“Welcome, Young Master Jin Zixuan,” Sect Leader Jiang said. Meng Yao reluctantly rose, back tensed to descend again if he’d straightened too early. “Welcome…”</p>
<p>“Young Master Meng Yao,” Wei Wuxian offered. Meng Yao’s tongue caught in his throat. “He’s come to join our House at my request.” </p>
<p>A lifetime of careful neutrality paid off; Meng Yao was so thrown he didn’t even know what his natural reaction would be.</p>
<p>“And Wei Wuxian,” Sect Leader Jiang continued. His voice was hard, his gaze unforgiving. “You were expected much earlier than this.” </p>
<p>“Lil Apple isn’t afraid of standing still.” Wei Wuxian pouted. “You know I can’t ride a horse.” </p>
<p>Sect Leader Jiang leveled the man beside him with a look of curious irony, though his companion did not acknowledge it with so much as a blink. Without another glance towards Wei Wuxian, Sect Leader Jiang turned his attention to Jin Zixuan.</p>
<p>“Young Master Jin Zixuan, if you are here it means you are prepared to spend a year in this court, in service to the Lord of Jade and the Lord of Blades, proving yourself worthy of my sister. Do you enter the Unclean Realm with a full understanding of this?” It was painfully formal, and not a tradition Meng Yao recognized from his readings of the traditions favoured by the Jiang, Nie or Lan. He was glad to have received Wei Wuxian’s warning. </p>
<p>“I acknowledge this to be true,” Jin Zixuan nodded. He bowed again. </p>
<p>“Young Master Meng Yao,” Sect Leader Jiang continued, “If you are here to join our Household, you are welcome. We ask you for honourable service, and will demand nothing of you that will bring you shame. You are welcome to stay as you like and leave as you will. Do you enter the Unclean Realm with a full understanding of this?” </p>
<p>“I acknowledge this to be true,” Meng Yao lied. </p>
<p>“Wei Wuxian—”</p>
<p>Whatever formal greeting existed between reunited family members was forestalled as a small figured barrelled out of a door on the side of the courtyard with a prolonged and enthusiastic scream of “<em>baba!</em>” </p>
<p>Wei Wuxian spun around and dropped to his knees to collect the small child in a tight embrace. “Radish!” </p>
<p>The child, probably around six years if Meng Yao guessed correctly, proceeded to babble at such speed that the wind itself probably grumbled in envy. Wei Wuxian nodded, following along with every sign of attentiveness until the child had to stop to drag out a breath. </p>
<p>“Uncle was about to tell me my rules,” Wei Wuxian told the child. </p>
<p>“You know your rules, baba,” the child giggled. </p>
<p>“I acknowledge this to be true,” Wei Wuxian said with a playful twist of his mouth. “Hey! Jiang Cheng, is that good enough?” </p>
<p>“You!” Sect Leader Jiang, Jiang Yanli and their companion swept down the stairs as one, though the man robed in white moved a bit quicker. He reached Wei Wuxian and took his wrist, their eyes meeting intensely for a moment before he nodded and offered the smallest twitch of his lips in greeting. </p>
<p>“I am going to eat that stupid donkey,” Sect Leader Jiang grumbled, clapping his brother on the back, any and all offense apparently forgiven. He turned to Jin Zixuan and offered a much more sedate personal greeting. </p>
<p>“Shijie,” Wei Wuxian whimpered imploringly. </p>
<p>But it seemed Jiang Yanli’s eyes were only for Meng Yao’s brother. Jin Zixuan, similarly captivated, smartly remained silent instead of ruining the moment by saying something idiotic, as he was rumoured to do when flustered. Having never seen him around a woman in which he’d expressed any interest, Meng Yao was curious to see how true the words might prove.</p>
<p>“Welcome home,” she whispered. </p>
<p>Jin Zixuan’s hands twitched towards her, but at Sect Leader Jiang’s pointed cough they fell resolutely to his side. Instead, he opened his mouth and Meng Yao braced himself. </p>
<p>“I am <em>so</em> pleased to be here,” he replied. Levelly. A completely acceptable response without offering unintentional insult or disparaging the lady at all. What a shocking and unexpected development. If the mudslinging were to be believed, he was incapable of stringing together a single sentence without offering offense.</p>
<p>“Were you good for a-die, radish?” Wei Wuxian asked. He punctuated his question with a kiss to the other man’s cheek. It lingered, and Meng Yao diverted his eyes when it threatened to last longer than was appropriate for him to observe. </p>
<p>“A-Yuan is always good,” the man assured him. Wei Wuxian’s smile threatened Meng Yao’s eyes with its brightness. He turned away, which had the adverse effect of drawing the attention of the small crowd. </p>
<p>“Lan Zhan, A-Cheng, shijie, come and meet Meng Yao.” Wei Wuxian turned the full intensity of his attention to Meng Yao. “You should have seen it. If we hadn’t had such good negotiators on our side, he would’ve taken the Unclean Realm for everything including the bed linens.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao dropped his eyes to the ground. “Young Master Wei  is too generous.” </p>
<p>It was a strange experience, being formally introduced to Sect Leader Jiang, Jiang Yanli, and Lan Wangji, the brother of the Lord of Jade and—more importantly according to Wei Wuxian—Wei Wuxian’s husband. The atmosphere was less restrained than it had been during the earlier greeting, a deep feeling of camaraderie Meng Yao found puzzling. </p>
<p>Speculation around the presence of the Jiang siblings in the Unclean Realm suggested they were hostages, kept on a short leash to ensure the peace left in the wake of the Sunshot Campaign lasted. Sect Leader Yao, whenever he visited Koi Tower, was effusive in his complaints about it. When Wei Wuxian spoke of their House, Meng Yao thought it to be coded language. He wasn’t accustomed to being incorrect.</p>
<p>“And you should have heard his ideas on the trade routes we established along the river last year. I told you we were being cheated.” Wei Wuxian smacked Sect Leader Jiang’s chest. Meng Yao felt dangerously and completely out of his depth. He was aware that he had taken certain liberties in Koi Tower in the hopes of being seen as family, but nothing extended to treating anyone of such dignified personage with such casual familiarity.</p>
<p>“He’s very good,” Jin Zixuan echoed. </p>
<p>Thank heavens Meng Yao was saved from having to figure out how to feel about <em>that</em> by Jiang Yanli offering to have him shown to his rooms to rest after his journey. </p>
<p>Jiang Yanli offered a small smile of commiseration, and Meng Yao found himself considering Jin Zixuan’s desire to have her as a bride, for the first time wondering if it was the politically-motivated arrangement Jin Guangshan believed. Jiang Yanli was fair, but forgettable. His mother would have said she’d only stand out in a room that lacked any true beauties. Yet there was an open kindness to her eyes he found compelling, after living so long in Koi Tower where such things needed to be ruthlessly suppressed to avoid being shattered against colder realities.</p>
<p>Led through a maze of corridors—the Unclean Realm, truly, was more of a city than a single fortress—he did not notice the quality of the lodgings until he was shown to an impressive suite that made his breath catch. There was no real finery, but the space was pleasantly open and the obvious pride of craftsmanship in everything from the tables to the painted privacy screens was nothing less than breathtaking. There was a full sitting room, replete with a well-stocked desk and greeting area, with a second area off the side obviously designed for sleeping. </p>
<p>“Lady Jiang, I think there’s been some mistake. This looks like a room for family members.” </p>
<p>Jiang Yanli inclined her head. “Of course, Young Master Meng. You are A-Xuan’s brother, are you not?” </p>
<p>How did she know that? There had been no mention of their familial relationship during introductions, and regardless, “I have been brought here to assist with administrative duties.” </p>
<p>Her smile was small and sad. “You are a member of our House, now. And you are family.” She bowed over her hands. “I’ll leave you to collect yourself. When you’re ready, we would be happy to sit with you.” </p>
<p>How strange, Meng Yao thought as she left him standing along in a room larger than he’d ever been allowed to call his own, that his hands were shaking so badly. He tucked them deep into his sleeves and allowed a moment to collect himself, as she had suggested.</p><hr/>
<p>Collecting himself took longer than anticipated, and by the time he believed himself capable of conducting himself to the standards he considered acceptable, it was nearly time for the evening meal. He dressed in his finest robes which, to be fair, were still nowhere close to what he should be wearing to meet the Two Lords. He did his best to straighten them, prepared his most pleasing expression, and made his way into the corridors to find the main hall, glad Jiang Yanli had pointed it out to him in passing.</p>
<p>In Koi Tower, dinners were lavish affairs attended by servants in attire designed to appeal to his father's sensibilities. He guessed, based on their reputation, that the Two Lords would value austerity, and that the courses would offer nutrition over enjoyment. However, based on what he'd experienced so far, he was willing to temper those assumptions for the moment. Nothing about the Unclean Realm had been as expected, and he was tired of feeling out of his depth.</p>
<p>The main hall was decorated with the heraldry of the Two Lords, as expected, and while it was certainly large enough to host a healthy crowd, only six people occupied the table closest to the two empty thrones at the head of the room.</p>
<p>Wei Wuxian caught sight of him and waved him into one of the free seats at the table.</p>
<p>He bowed, as was proper, before taking the seat beside Jin Zixuan, across from A-Yuan and his fathers. There was one noticeably empty seat at the other end of the table, beside Sect Leader Jiang.</p>
<p>The rapid fire conversation between the man himself and Wei Wuxian barely paused at his arrival, though the latter spared him a welcoming grin.</p>
<p>He leaned closer to Jin Zixuan, "Will our hosts be joining us tonight?"</p>
<p>"Probably not for a month or more, as I understand," his half-brother helpfully supplied. "They're addressing some sort of border skirmish in the north."</p>
<p>Well, that would give Meng Yao a decent amount of time to find his footing, not to mention begin his cursory search of the Unclean Realm for evidence of the dragons. Doubtless they had accompanied their riders, but if he could find where they were kept he might find some clue as to how they could be tamed.</p>
<p>The meal was good. Less refined than those served under his father’s roof, but pleasingly spiced. He noted that three of the table’s occupants added heaping spoonfuls of roasted chilis to their dish, though his brother and Lan Wangji abstained. A-Yuan helped himself to a bite from Wei Wuxian’s plate and then to the entirety of Lan Wangji’s tea. Meng Yao smiled into his own bowl before he noticed he was doing so. </p>
<p>“Meng Yao, if you do have some thoughts on improving our trade agreements with the Yao I’d love to hear them tomorrow if you’re inclined to share your time,” Sect Leader Jiang said.</p>
<p>“This one would be honoured to offer any and all assistance,” Meng Yao agreed. Sect Leader Jiang’s face twitched into a small frown. Not a man for demure acceptance, then. Perhaps Meng Yao could have anticipated this, based on his experiences with Wei Wuxian. “I understand you’ll soon be entering into discussions with the Su as well.” </p>
<p>“Unfortunately,” Wei Wuxian rolled his eyes and leaned over to poke Lan Wangji over A-Yuan’s head. Lan Wangji easily caught his hand before it found its mark upon his cheek. “Lan Zhan, you also wanted a new tutor for A-Yuan, didn’t you? Meng Yao would be well-suited for the calligraphy bits. I’ve never seen writing so fine.” </p>
<p>“Once again, Young Master Wei is too kind,” Mang Yao said. </p>
<p>Before more could be spoken, another man swept into the room, a full course late for dinner. He plopped himself down into the last remaining seat and slumped over into the Sect Leader Jiang’s side. “Jiang Cheng, why is my life so hard?” </p>
<p>Sect Leader Jiang inspected the ceiling, possibly in search of forbearance. “I don’t want to know, Huaisang.” </p>
<p>“But Da-ge isn’t here, and I don’t have anyone else to complain to.” </p>
<p>“You’ve never seemed to mind the sound of your own voice, so I don’t know why you can’t talk to yourself.” </p>
<p>“Jiang Yanli, tell your brother to stop saying such cruel things to me. He’s supposed to be representing Xichen-ge and Da-ge while they’re gone and should be better tempered.” </p>
<p>“Hey, hey, hey, he’s nicer to you than he is to me,” Wei Wuxian pointed out. </p>
<p>“That’s because you would drive a monk to madness,” Huaisang said. He noticed Meng Yao, apparently for the first time, and straightened. “My apologies. We’re unaccustomed to guests, and this one frequently forgets his manners.” </p>
<p>“Nie Huaisang,” Sect Leader Jiang hissed. Ah. The Lord of Blades’ brother, about which little was known save for his reputation for weak cultivation. Privately, Meng Yao wished he might have attended at least one Discussion Conference in the past, if only to have seen the members of the Household in person before now. Even Jiang Wanyin and Jiang Yanli were often in attendance, despite their reluctance—forbiddance?—to leave the Unclean Realm.</p>
<p>“He learned that tone from Da-ge,” Wei Wuxian muttered.</p>
<p>“Wei Wuxian!” </p>
<p>“Boys,” Jiang Yanli said calmly. They all settled, suitably chastened. “Young Master Meng Yao is Zixuan’s brother, Huaisang, and has come to join our House.”</p>
<p>Nie Huaisang sniffed. “Better here than Koi Tower, I suppose.” He peered at Meng Yao consideringly. “Do you enjoy painting?” </p>
<p>Meng Yao tilted his chin down. “I have no talent for it.” </p>
<p>“Ah, ah, not the same thing,” Nie Huaisang said. “What about music? Do you play anything?” </p>
<p>“Unfortunately not.” </p>
<p>“Meng Yao was not fortunate enough to have much opportunity for leisurely activities, before,” Jin Zixuan said. Meng Yao blinked at his dinner and waited for the ensuing proclamation: he was here to work. “I’m hoping that will change.” </p>
<p>“It needs to, especially if he’s going to be sitting with us at meals. Ugh, could you imagine having nothing at all of substance to discuss?” </p>
<p>“We’ve eaten with you often enough there’s no need to imagine,” Sect Leader Jiang grumped. </p>
<p>“Jiang Cheng!” </p>
<p>Meng Yao allowed a moment to admit he had not anticipated the brother of the Lord of Blades to be quite so… foppish. Of course, everyone told and retold escalating and extravagant stories of Sect Leader Jiang and the dashing Wei Wuxian. Besides the Two Lords, no one else had managed to glean such a reputation during the Sunshot Campaign, a point of irritation to the Jin, who often demanded Jin Zixuan’s own contributions to be equally spoken of, for all they had failed to be as significant. </p>
<p>At the end of the meal, Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji scooped up A-Yuan to ferry him to bed, though not before the child wished everyone sweet dreams. He continued to be impossibly adorable. Meng Yao enjoyed the simplicity of children, though he rarely had cause to interact with them these days. He decided he would not mind if Lan Wangji took Wei Wuxian’s suggestion of engaging Meng Yao in some capacity as a tutor. </p>
<p>Jin Zixuan walked Meng Yao back to his room after bidding his intended a sweet farewell at a respectable distance, under the watchful eye of her younger brother.</p>
<p>“I…” He paused when they reached Meng Yao’s door. “I hope you can be happy here, Meng Yao.” He coughed, looked at his feet and then regarded the ceiling for a moment before soldiering on. “...brother.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao’s eyes widened so far he worried for the integrity of his retinas. </p>
<p>Jin Zixuan nodded stiffly. “That is all.” He coughed once more and briskly took off down the hallway. He paused at the end of the corridor, turned back, and—eyes fixed directly forward—made his way to the door across from Meng Yao’s before nodding a final time and letting himself inside. </p>
<p>Struck completely dumb for the first time in his life, Meng Yao entered his room and barely made it to the nearby desk to lower himself down instead of plopping down indecorously to the floor. </p>
<p>Brother. Not the bastard son of Jin Guangshan, nor the semi-indentured servant purchased along with the marriage contract. <em>Brother</em>. </p>
<p>What about this place inspired madness among its occupants? And was Meng Yao in danger if he remained?</p><hr/>
<p>Before coming to Koi Tower to introduce himself, Meng Yao had worked tirelessly to gather all the information he possibly could on his father and his father's family. He spent what little coin he had left after the trip from Yunping in wine houses, buying rounds to loosen knowledgeable tongues. He learned of no less than three other illegitimate children, countless mistresses, and surprisingly considering a man of his father's particular passions, only a single heir. </p>
<p>Jin Zixuan, they said well into their first jar, was a skilled warrior. A testament to the power and dignity of Koi Tower. He fearlessly led his father's army to battle against Wen Ruohan and was present when the last blow ended the Sunshot Campaign.</p>
<p>Jin Zixuan, they said after their third jar, was hopeless with women, and if left to his own devices the Jin name would crumble for want of his finding a wife to tolerate him.</p>
<p>Jin Zixuan, they slurred after the sixth jar, was a coward who spent a month of the war hiding from.combat until the Two Lords had all but guaranteed victory, at which point he crawled out from whatever rock under which he'd hidden to stand alongside them.</p>
<p>Meng Yao had expected a craven, preening milksop whose skills were suited to a training yard instead of a battlefield. </p>
<p>The hypothesis seemed accurate at first glance. Jin Zixuan proved conceited, certainly, and incredibly skilled with the blade. Arrogant in that he had returned to Koi Tower a war hero, though without a reputation close to rivaling that of Wei Wuxian, lacking the insistence on the dramatic that drove Wei Wuxian's exploits towards inconceivability.</p>
<p>It all left Meng Yao wholly unprepared for the unexpected kindness the other man showed at the bottom of the Koi Tower steps. While the healers reset his knee, Meng Yao allowed that the drunken rumours had not painted a full picture, and wondered what else they might have overlooked.</p>
<p>That night, awake as he listened to the wind whistling outside his window, Meng Yao pondered the rest of it. Most of Jin Zixuan's reputation had been built up before the Sunshot Campaign. At Koi Tower, he leaned into it, albeit unintentionally, through remaining aloof from everyone around him.</p>
<p>Perhaps here, in the Unclean Realm, Meng Yao would find an unexpected opal concealed by ugly stone.</p>
<p>He slept fairly well, and rose early to find a simple breakfast waiting outside his door. He ate quickly and then left in search of occupation. He'd planned to begin his search after becoming acquainted with the basic layout; less chance of stumbling upon something he couldn't easily explain away without having to grovel in a humiliating fashion to avoid penalization.</p>
<p>Draconic imagery decorated the Unclean Realm in quiet dignity. No doubt, when his father possessed one of the dragons, there would be nothing save ostentatious displays reminding all and sundry of Jin grandeur. Here, the effect was subtle. Beams with the finest carved detail of scales. Wood painted a touch darker with the picture of a flank or claw. Instead of making the place oppressive, it made it majestic in ways that could not have been anything other than carefully considered ornamentation. </p>
<p>Following a long painted line of a dragon’s flank out onto a long balcony lining the outside wall, Meng Yao immediately dropped into a bow when he found himself face-to-face with an imposing figure bedecked in purple.</p>
<p>“Forgive this one, Sect Leader Jiang,” Meng Yao said. “I was only looking around.”</p>
<p>“Enough of that,” Sect Leader Jiang snapped, surprisingly irritated by the appropriate deference. He waited for Meng Yao to rise. “You and I will be family soon enough.” He paused and huffed a breath. “You may refer to me as Jiang Wanyin, if you wish.” </p>
<p>“Jiang Wanyin, then,” Meng Yao repeated, earning himself a nod and a small twist of the lips that might’ve been called a smile if it hadn’t been set beneath such a cross brow. </p>
<p>Jiang Wanyin returned his attention to the courtyard below, a spacious area filled with greenery and a calm air. “So, do you want to tell me why Wei Wuxian actually brought you here, or are people going to make me keep guessing?” </p>
<p>“I believe I impressed him with my words during the negotiations over your sister’s marriage contract.” </p>
<p>Jiang Wanyin thought it over. “Possibly. He’s always surprised when he’s not the smartest man in the room and he makes stupid decisions when surprised.” Jiang Wanyin gritted his teeth and turned his face towards Meng Yao. “Not that bringing you here was a stupid decision. I’m sure you’re very capable.” </p>
<p>“Thank you. I shall do my best.” Meng Yao tucked the morsel of insight to the back of his mind for later. “Did you care to look over the trade agreements?” </p>
<p>“If you don’t mind.” Jiang Wanyin took off along the walkway, and Meng Yao followed slightly behind him until Jiang Wanyin cut him a stern look and they fell into step together. “I’m not the one who will be conducting negotiations if there are any changes, hopefully. Xichen-ge is usually the one to handle such matters. Mingjue claims his temper runs too hot, though he has a good hand at diplomacy when he puts a mind to it.” </p>
<p>“Forgive me for asking, Jiang Wanyin, but I am not altogether familiar with the politics of the Unclean Realm.” Indeed, few people were, which led to a simply marvellous amount of speculation. “Are you not also capable of conducting such business?” </p>
<p>Jiang Wanyin’s mouth twisted, this time in a real smile. “I am. And were the discussions with regards to Yunmeng, I would do so without hesitation. But this involves Qinghe, and I happily cede the honour.” Interesting, for all they still claimed Gusu retained its sovereignty, that the Sect Leader conducted business on behalf of the Nie.</p>
<p>“Is it hard governing so far from your seat of power? Only,” Meng Yao hurried to add, “I wonder if my… if Jin Zixuan won’t find it equally difficult.” </p>
<p>“The benefits to being here far outweigh the difficulties,” Jiang Wanyin replied wryly. </p>
<p>“Of course.” A non-answer, unfortunately, but it left an opening at least. “May I ask about your decision to remain in the Unclean Realm, then? There was very little in the way of convincing reports after the war to confirm any accounts.” </p>
<p>“What do they say?” </p>
<p>“Only that the Two Lords make a habit of collecting rulers and war heroes to their side,” Meng Yao replied. </p>
<p>“I suppose they do. Any reasons speculating as to why?” </p>
<p>“None that can be repeated in polite company.” Jiang Wanyin guffawed, and Meng Yao half-tripped over himself at the sound, “I’m sorry, I speak out of turn.” </p>
<p>“Not at all. It’s refreshing.”</p>
<p>It certainly was; Jiang Wanyin seemed the sort of man to whom one could endear themselves through sly jokes made unexpectedly. Meng Yao would present a quiet and respectful young man who occasionally offered up amusing commentary in a sotto voice. Jiang Wanyin would come to see him as someone he could trust without fear of reprisal, for nothing bound two people together quite like a secret. In this case, the secret—as far as Jiang Wanyin would be concerned—would be the sense of humour hidden behind a placid expression. </p>
<p>He trailed Jiang Wanyin through the Unclean Realm, listening attentively as the other man helpfully pointed out places of interest, mapping out the hallways and labyrinthine corridors. Unlike Koi Tower, Jiang Wanyin had no forbidding words or threats regarding where Meng Yao was permitted to go. That wasn’t to suggest a dearth of hidden rooms. Jin Guangshan kept a number available for housing his mistresses—one of Meng Yao’s less desirable duties had been coordinating the rotation of women through his father’s good graces, removing the unfortunate discards and their possessions and installing new ones in the private chambers. It probably partly explained why Madam Jin hated him so intensely. Presumably the Unclean Realm already had someone on hand for such situations, if they were at all necessary. He’d never bothered to ascertain whether Jin Guangshan’s proclivities were common practice among the gentry, or particular to the man himself.</p>
<p>They ended up in a small reception room, and Jiang Wanyin poured them both tea before settling down to discuss the particulars. Very interesting. Meng Yao admitted to some astonishment that, regardless of what he’d said, a Sect Leader served him tea. While the reach of the Yunmeng Jiang did not expand over a significant area—certainly not compared to the combined area of Qinghe and Gusu—he was a ruler, and yet all his behaviours suggested it was a title as ill-fitting as a child trying on his parent’s robes. He spoke with authority, but actions did not suit words. Jin Guangshan would never lower himself to pour tea for anyone, even someone who could be described as an equal. </p>
<p>This, Meng Yao decided, was knowledge he could apply with practical application when convenient. A carefully placed “gege” here or there, once their relationship was more established, would likely yield some wonderful results. Especially with his seemingly tumultuous relationship with Wei Wuxian. </p>
<p>“It’s an acquired taste,” he warned Meng Yao. “Be warned.” </p>
<p>At the first touch of the tea to his lips, Meng Yao hummed in what he hoped sounded like polite surprise. From the way Jiang Wanyin smirked, he’d likely missed ‘polite’ by a mile. The tea licked at his lips like the brush of a burned branch and left behind a charred aftertaste he found himself wincing through under Jiang Wanyin’s amusement. </p>
<p>“It’s fortifying.” </p>
<p>“One of the kinder words for it. I try to bring in Yunmeng leaves, but my sister and Wei Wuxian hoard them like gold. And you might as well drink water instead of the Gusu blends.</p>
<p>“Now, then. Let’s get to work.” </p>
<p>They made decent progress. Jiang Wanyin’s politics were not as ruthless as those of Koi Tower, and he appeared willing to make more concessions—“might as well, before Xichen returns and makes them anyway”—but evened them out with balanced requests as well. </p>
<p>An hour later, while elbow-deep in the proposal around mining compromises, Nie Huaisang sailed into the room in a cloud of floral-scented air. Meng Yao stood and bowed, though his companion remained seated and, to all appearances, unimpressed.</p>
<p>“Jiang Cheng! This is a completely unacceptable violation of the respect due to me as a member of this house.” </p>
<p>“You’re exaggerating,” Jiang Wanyin replied.</p>
<p>“I haven’t even told you what it is.” </p>
<p>“I can confidently say that it doesn’t matter.”</p>
<p>Nie Huaisang’s mouth shifted into an angry moue. “You are not funny.” </p>
<p>Jiang Wanyin offered no reply and Nie Huaisang huffed. Then, almost as an afterthought, he looked towards Meng Yao. “I suppose we can discuss it later. Are you done with Young Master Meng? I want to have a conversation with someone I haven't seen every day for the past two years.”</p>
<p>“No I’m not. Why don’t you go bother Jin Zixuan?” </p>
<p>“I already did. He wanted my help writing Jiang Yanli a love poem. I told him the only poetry I wrote is dirty limericks and he took off before I could recite one. Probably because he knew you'd kill him.”</p>
<p>“Damn right I would. What’s he doing writing her poetry anyway? He shouldn't even be talking to her.”</p>
<p>Hesitant to insert himself, but feeling an unexpected rush of empathy for his… brother, Meng Yao offered, “Well, they are engaged.” </p>
<p>“And he thinks that gives him the right to take liberties?” Meng Yao blinked. Liberties… such as talking to her? While he was shocked at all that Jin Zixuan was capable of conducting a conversation when not explicitly discussing anything of an official capacity, he couldn’t help but wonder if Jiang Wanyin understood the point of Jin Zixuan’s year of residence. “I'm going to find Wei Wuxian so we can go remind him of the discussion we had after the war.”</p>
<p>Nie Huaisang grinned. “Oh, good, then you won't mind me taking Young Master Meng.” He snuck a hand under Meng Yao’s elbow. “Come along. You can give me your frank and honest opinion of the fan I’m working on.” </p>
<p>The fan in question, once Meng Yao had been dragged halfway across the Unclean Realm to a much more decorative living space, was without question the most hideous thing he’d ever seen. The colours—garishly pigmented and thrown together on the fan in a poor representation of a… bird? Snake? He honestly couldn’t say with any confidence what he was supposed to be looking at. The one very minor positive he could glean from it came from the fact he would never himself have to use it. </p>
<p>“Well?” Nie Huaisang demanded. </p>
<p>“Did you paint it yourself?” Meng Yao questioned. </p>
<p>Nie Huaisang blinked. “Does it matter?” When Meng Yao turned his eyes towards him, he waved the much more tasteful fan in his hand and laughed. “Of course, of course. I did.” </p>
<p>“Ah. I can see the evidence of very dedicated craftsmanship.” </p>
<p>Nie Huaisang hummed. “A very diplomatic answer. What else?” </p>
<p>“Your use of colour is very bold.” </p>
<p>“Do you like it?” </p>
<p>“...” Meng Yao bit down on his lower lip before reluctantly pasting on a smile and nodding. </p>
<p>His cheerful smile increased tenfold in intensity and he flapped the fan in his hand effusively. “I appreciate it, Young Master Meng.” He took the fan and returned it to its spot on his desk. “Would you like some tea?” </p>
<p>“Oh, I couldn’t.” He’d finished the single cup Jiang Wanyin poured for him earlier, and had not requested a refill. </p>
<p>“I do happen to have a more delicate blend if that suits your taste.”</p>
<p>Meng Yao’s smile shifted closer to genuine. “Well. In that case.” </p>
<p>He spent an hour listening to the other man talk with very little to show for it, save the much more pleasant lingering of flowery notes left on his tongue. Nie Huaisang talked much and said little, and even Meng Yao’s most careful attempts at gleaning information about the Unclean Realm was met with a flap of his fan or a shake of his head. A man of good breeding, obviously, his manners were impeccable, and he did offer up commentary that had Meng Yao hiding a chuckle behind his sleeve more than once. Unfortunately, amusing observations seemed to be all he was good for. </p>
<p>Once Nie Huaisang released him, Meng Yao spent the remainder of his day continuing his explorations of the Unclean Realm. The family living quarters were all tucked higher up in the mountains’ embrace, leaving the broad main fortress standing tall as an entryway. He thought about making his way down, but hesitated. He found it more than likely the dragons stayed in the main compound, but it wouldn’t hurt to have a thorough knowledge of the rest of the city before continuing in his explorations. </p>
<p>He hadn’t expected to be summoned for the evening meal, but yet again found himself tucked in beside Jin Zixuan, who was looking across the table at Wei Wuxian and Jiang Wanyin with poorly-veiled annoyance. On the other hand, the brothers appeared positively delighted. Wei Wuxian scooped a healthy pile of food onto his plate, all elbows and shaking mirth.</p>
<p>Jiang Yanli joined them in short order, tucked in against Lan Wangji and holding A-Yuan’s hand in her own. She alighted down beside her betrothed and smiled sweetly across the table at her brothers. </p>
<p>“I understand the three of you spent time together today,” she said with a gracious smile. “I’m glad everyone is getting along. It would be a shame if there were any misunderstandings.” Slowly, the good humour leaked from Wei Wuxian and Jiang Wanyin’s expressions. While Lan Wangji, directly across from Meng Yao, remained to all appearances unaffected, there was a lightness in his expression Meng Yao couldn’t help but think indicated amusement. “Of course, A-Cheng and A-Xian both know I am capable of protecting my own heart.” </p>
<p>Lan Wangji took the forgotten spoon from Wei Wuxian’s unmoving hand and served A-Yuan. </p>
<p>“Yes, definitely shijie!” Wei Wuxian scrambled.</p>
<p>“Without doubt,” Jiang Wanyin nodded frantically. </p>
<p>“We all know you to be very capable,” Jin Zixuan agreed, gracious enough not to be smug in his victory.</p>
<p>She hummed and took a sip of her tea.</p><hr/>
<p>Meng Yao enjoyed routines when he could. At the brothel, as a child, he had created a set schedule for himself. The Madam often required assistance with mindless chores she hesitated to pay money for when a perfectly able-bodied boy would do. Afterwards, he spent his mornings sitting outside a local home, listening to the tutor school the children within. Afternoons he dedicated himself to reading where he could. Evenings found him tucked into a small room above the brothel’s main floor, eyes closed as he tried meditating or imagining himself elsewhere. He generally fell asleep against the wall, and often woke up back in his mother’s room tucked into his bed before doing it all again. He established routines even more quickly in Koi Tower, proactively checking and rechecking on administrative matters before they could escalate into problems. </p>
<p>In the Unclean Realm, with nothing but endless free time on his hands, he found himself at odds and anxious. He walked the corridors at night to give himself a good understanding of the walls around him. Footpaths darted out between the living quarters, hewn from the stone and forests surrounding the Unclean Realm and pressing the scent of mountain air and greenery into his skin and lungs. The pathways led deeper into the mountain range, and he thought a few times of exploring further afield, until reminding himself that walking through such terrain in the dark was more likely to end with a broken neck instead of advanced understanding. </p>
<p>Solitary walks aside, he found himself itching for occupation. Thus, when Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji sought him out a week after his arrival and tentatively asked if he wouldn’t mind assuming some role in tutoring A-Yuan, he jumped at the opportunity. </p>
<p>Supposedly, his duties extended only to calligraphy, as others had taken charge of the sundry education expected of a young master. However, A-Yuan was bright and biddable, and absorbed everything Meng Yao had to say, despite his young age. Soon enough, their lessons became longer and extended into history and what might generously be termed as philosophy, if one could claim to teach philosophy to anyone under the age of ten. He tried to make it a game, posing questions in such a way that A-Yuan could consider them in the context of a young mind and give them thought. He might not be the most robust educator, but from the serene set to Lan Wangji’s cool demeanor when he retrieved A-Yuan at the end of the day, it seemed to please. </p>
<p>A fortnight into his stay at the Unclean Realm, after Meng Yao had wound his way around his usual paths—he could not claim it was in the name of exploration any longer, but he still enjoyed the calm night air and solitary walks surrounded on all sides by the barely-tamed wilderness around them—he froze when he reached the edge of the treeline and found himself looking at the back of Lan Wangji’s broad, white-clad shoulders. </p>
<p>He remained at a distance, and pressed himself against one of the thick-trunked trees to avoid being seen. In all his days within the realm, he’d never seen Lan Wangji out so late. Wei Wuxian constantly laughed about his husband’s strict adherence to an early bedtime, nudging Men Yao and inviting him to share in the joke. </p>
<p>Lan Wangji looked up towards the peaks surrounding them and Meng Yao craned his neck to follow his gaze. It didn’t take long for him to see the trail of white, which he initially mistook for a wisp of cloud until he noticed the weaving movements carrying it against the gentle night wind. </p>
<p>Already far enough away to make it hard to see despite the generous light offered by the full moon, Meng Yao finally beheld the dragon. He could make out no details, save for the way its silvery body caught the moonlight and held it as though it were made of moonbeams itself, but seeing it at all made his breath catch in his throat. He watched it until it disappeared over the mountaintops, sharing the moment with Lan Wangji, who seemed similarly disposed. </p>
<p>He ducked back behind the tree once the dragon vanished, narrowly avoiding being spotted by Lan Wangji when he turned to go. There was a bundle caught up in his arms; Meng Yao only noticed a glimpse of it before he had to shuffle backwards to avoid discovery. </p>
<p>He waited, concealed by the trees, long enough for Lan Wangji to make it halfway down the mountain before creeping back to his room to write a letter to his father. </p>
<p>Despite the coded language, Jin Guangshan would doubtless understand what Meng Yao had to convey; he’d written before, but briefly and with no substantial details. After all, he reasoned, his father had no designs on the Unclean Realm itself, only the dragons within. He spoke exclusively about Jin Zixuan and the duty Jin Guangshan had impressed upon him, all language and allusions easily denied if the letter was intercepted. His father would understand. </p>
<p>The next morning, another boy joined A-Yuan in his lessons, walking confidently alongside Lan Wangji into the classroom. Like Lan Wangji and A-Yuan, he wore the Lan’s style of well-made white robes and a forehead ribbon, though his was slightly askew. Like A-Yuan, an accompanying sash of dark purple etched with turquoise thread marked him as a part of the Jiang family. Very curious. </p>
<p>“Young Master Meng, may I introduce Lan Jingyi. He will be staying with us from now on. If you have no objections to taking on another pupil, we would appreciate him being invited to join A-Yuan in his lessons.” </p>
<p>The boy was, perhaps, a year older than A-Yuan, and immediately greeted Meng Yao with a delighted grin and cheerful wave. His size suited the bundle Meng Yao had witnessed Lan Wangji carrying the night before, though he couldn’t imagine what the connection was between him and the dragon. </p>
<p>“I am of course honoured to be entrusted with the education of another young mind,” Meng Yao said with a slight bow. </p>
<p>The honour was soon overwhelmed by the utter disruptive chaos his new charge brought to proceedings. </p>
<p>This was not to say that Lan Jingyi was not a bright, charming child. He proved bright, and asked excellent questions about the material. His penmanship was on par with A-Yuan’s—his motor skills better developed, though the writing itself shakier—and he seemed to have already learned some of the rudimentary skills of which Meng Yao tried to impart. </p>
<p>Instead of concerns around his learning or ability to absorb the information, it was the endless talking.</p>
<p>“Teacher, I have a question.” Words Meng Yao dreaded within an hour of him having joined the class. “You said that the important thing when listening is that you are attentive and wait until it is your turn to speak so you can best understand the person speaking with you, but the last time I spoke with Xian-gege, he interrupted me three times when I was talking about the pear tree that grew in the courtyard where I lived before this”—he frequently repeated ‘where I lived before this,’ though also failed to provide any additional details—“and I really wanted to tell him about the pears, because they were the best ones ever, and it has twenty hundred pears on it every year, it was really big and the leaves were really pretty and sometimes there were rabbits under it though they didn’t like me and always ran away even when I shouted for them to come back and Xian-gege asked me about the bunnies even though I hadn’t <em>told</em> him about them yet and I don’t understand why he interrupted when <em>you</em> say that we shouldn’t interrupt and everyone else is always telling me not to interrupt, but then he does it and I can’t?”</p>
<p>Meng Yao waited. A-Yuan listened, enthralled.</p>
<p>“And then A-Yuan and Zhan-gege asked me what the pears tasted like and if you eat them too early they are very sour and if sour things make your lips pucker so bad you can't talk should everyone eat sour pears while they're supposed to be listening?"</p>
<p>There, with chaff finally separated, waited the actual question. "It is a very unique idea, Jingyi. I think I shall propose it next time I have something important to say to Young Master Wei."</p>
<p>Satisfied, Jingyi returned his attention to his work. For the moment.</p>
<p>A-Yuan appeared utterly taken with the other boy. While there were other children in the Unclean Realm, none of them had the privilege of calling A-Yuan "cousin" and every time it happened it suffused A-Yuan's face with brilliant joy. It was, in Meng Yao's opinion, utterly worth the chaos.</p>
<p>Meng Yao expected dinners to become horrifyingly untenable with the additional chatter, but Wei Wuxian seemed happy to distract both boys, and ended up shifting the seating to ensure he was always between them.</p>
<p>"Is it nice having someone on the same level to speak to, Wuxian?" Nie Huaisang asked slyly.</p>
<p>"They are the best conversationalists I've ever known," Wei Wuxian replied with every evidence of sincerity as Jingyi splayed across his lap to ask A-Yuan a very serious question regarding the possibilities for dessert. "No offense, Lan Zhan. You're a very close third." </p>
<p>Meng Yao privately wondered at the statement, but the sincerity remained and he didn’t believe the words to be disingenuous.</p>
<p>"I don't want to think how they dealt with him in Cloud Recesses," Jiang Wanyin muttered.</p>
<p>Very interesting. If the dragon had delivered him, as Meng Yao could only surmise from available evidence, the question then became what business did the dragons—and, by extension, the Two Lords—have there, when they were supposedly on the northern border?</p><hr/>
<p>The lovely days of summer shifted towards sweltering as they drew towards autumn, as though the world sought to make a last, token protest before heading abed for the winter.</p>
<p>The blazing day pressed into Meng Yao’s pores, relentlessly seeking him out in every corner of the Unclean Realm, even those inner recesses comprised mostly of stone. Vents meant to channel in fresh air only delivered the heat directly to them, and Meng Yao’s fan—a much more tastefully painted specimen compared to the monstrosity Nei Huaisang still carried around—did little to assuage the choking heat in the air. </p>
<p>The boys slumped on their side of the desk, and Meng Yao couldn’t bring himself to fault them for it. It was a miserable day, and while both his students were generally engaged and interested in the material, the stifling air made it hard to focus on anything.</p>
<p>Nodding off, Lan Jingyi half-toppled over as his elbow slipped off the side of the table, smacking fully into A-Yuan and sending them both tumbling to the floor. They bumbled about in a tangle of tiny, uncoordinated limbs until managing to separate and snapping to an admirable facsimile of attention. </p>
<p>“I don’t believe this is working,” Meng Yao admitted. Understanding the need for strategic withdrawal was paramount when working with children, he’d discovered. </p>
<p>“We’re sorry, teacher,” A-Yuan said miserably. He stood and bowed. While Meng Yao did not share Wei Wuxian’s conviction of A-Yuan being objectively the cutest child to ever exist, this did stretch the bounds of his doubt. It was terribly adorable. Jingyi jumped up and followed suit. </p>
<p>“None of that,” Meng Yao assured them. They both straightened. “Shall I arrange for a picnic?” </p>
<p>A-Yuan and Jingyi exchanged looks of absolute delight. “Really?!” Jingyi’s already gregarious idea of volume control had been influenced by the shared association with Jiang Wanyin and Wei Wuxian; that was to say, his whisper could have been used to make announcements at the foot of Koi Tower. </p>
<p>“Really. Both of you continue with the exercise while I go and arrange for a small lunch.” </p>
<p>The boys set themselves to the task with renewed vigor, and Meng Yao went in search of nibbles. The kitchens helpfully put together a small basket of travel-friendly items, and one of the cooks—a weathered auntie who always served a mix of delicious food catering to all palates involved—suggested a small watering hole not a mile from the eastern gates. </p>
<p>“This is very good of you, Young Master Meng,” she said. She surreptitiously tucked in a few extra sweets and offered Meng Yao an agreeable smile. “Make sure the boys don’t eat them all.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao bowed. “Very kind.” </p>
<p>By the time he made it back to the boys, Wei Wuxian had appeared in the room, idly doodling what appeared to be talisman designs on one of Meng Yao’s blank pages. “Meng Yao! What’s this I hear about you abducting Jingyi and my radish?” </p>
<p>A cold splash of anxiety dropped from Meng Yao’s throat to his gut. Of course it was inappropriate to presume such familiarity when he was only a servant. “I apologize, Young Master Wei, I thought—”</p>
<p>“Ah, ah, ah. The only way to properly make amends for such a serious crime is to invite me along.” He eyed the nearly overstuffed basket. “Especially if auntie packed up any of her spicy pork buns.” </p>
<p>“There may be one or two,” Meng Yao admitted, though reluctance still squeezed at his windpipe. “Though you may have to fight Jingyi for them.” The older boy had taken to the Jiang siblings’ lamentable habit of piling their plates high with chilis. Whether or not he enjoyed them seemed entirely beyond the point.</p>
<p>Jingyi jumped to his feet, “I will win.” </p>
<p>Wei Wuxian laughed and ruffled his hair. “I have no doubt.” </p>
<p>Truthfully, having Wei Wuxian along was an unexpected blessing. Meng Yao was fully confident in his abilities to handle his charges in the classroom, but hadn’t anticipated that an easy walk for a fully grown man would be such an ordeal for the boys. </p>
<p>Wei Wuxian ended up carrying them both, leaving Meng Yao to handle the basket. He grinned ear to ear the entire time, waving away offers to switch as Jingyi clung to his back while A-Yuan remained nestled happily in his arms, the two of them chattering happily over Wei Wuxian's shoulder. The obviously well-loved path took them from the Unclean Realm into the wild hurst, the tight foliage above their heads instantly offering some much-needed shade. </p>
<p>“I haven’t had much chance to explore the area outside of the Unclean Realm,” Meng Yao admitted. The path was littered with rocks and raised roots, making for easy footholds but difficult navigation when one was carrying two small children. Wei Wuxian managed with remarkable dexterity. </p>
<p>“Ah, it’s all mountains and scrub in every direction,” Wei Wuxian said. His face twisted. “And Koi Tower to the south, and you got the scenic route on the way here.” He paused a moment to boost A-Yuan further up his chest and tuck one arm back behind Jingyi’s bottom. “Qinghe’s nothing on Yunmeng, I have to say. I miss the lakes, and all the green. This is about as close as we get, and it doesn’t compare.</p>
<p>“Still,” he continued as they reached their destination—a sizable pond just shy of being called a lake, where a generous number of the surrounding trees had been cleared away to provide places to sit. “It has its merits, I suppose. Don’t tell Da-ge or Huaisang I said so, though, or I’ll never stop hearing about it.” Ringed by trees, and with the water so near, the heat dwindled to almost pleasant levels, though it still sat heavy in Meng Yao’s lungs. </p>
<p>Wei Wuxian set the boys down and shooed them towards the water to cool off, then slumped to the ground without any obvious thoughts to his respectable robes. Meng Yao hesitantly took a seat beside him, though he remained upright in a proper seat instead of a boneless slouch, and was rewarded with a broad grin. </p>
<p>“You’ve been with us a month, now,” Wei Wuxian said, eyes carefully on the boys as Jingyi kicked off his boots and ran into the pond with a pleased scream. A-Yuan removed his shoes carefully, and set them down neatly. He took a moment to straighten Jingyi’s as well before taking a few, much more sedate steps into the clear water. His sensibilities were completely overcome when Jingyi belly flopped directly in front of him and completely soaked his robes to the chin. “Are you settled?” </p>
<p>“The boys are excellent students,” Meng Yao reported. “Especially A-Yuan, who I think will have a remarkable gift for calligraphy.” </p>
<p>“Aiya, Meng Yao, I wasn’t asking about the boys,” Wei Wuxian’s tone was chiding, but he smiled. “I want to know about you.”</p>
<p>“Me?” Meng Yao repeated. “I am happy to be of service of course…” </p>
<p>“You are an incredibly frustrating person,” Wei Wuxian told him. </p>
<p>Meng Yao’s chin drooped towards his chest, mostly to hide the sudden twist of his lips. “It has been said before.” </p>
<p>Wei Wuxian smacked his own forehead. “You…” He huffed. “You remind me of Lan Zhan, when we first met.” </p>
<p>“I sincerely doubt it.” </p>
<p>“No, no, listen: he didn’t like being teased by me. Or anyone. Because when he was younger, the only people to tease him were cruel. He spent a life building up an icy face to prevent people from seeing how he felt, or from trying to get to know him better. Your face isn’t icy, but it’s the same as his. Hiding everything away, because you don’t want people to know how you’re feeling in case they use it to hurt you.” </p>
<p>Dangerous, as Meng Yao had always thought. That he had some sour pear. Thank <em>fuck</em> he had the practice of maintaing neutrality. “Quite the assessment, Young Master Wei.” </p>
<p>“I am going to make you call me Wuxian if it’s the last thing I do.” </p>
<p>“If you keep trying to find all my soft spots, it will be.” </p>
<p>“Ah ha! Jiang Cheng told me you had a sense of humour!” Wei Wuxian poked Meng Yao’s side, and allowed Meng Yao to slap his hand away instead of dodging the mostly ineffectual smack. “Anyway, Lan Zhan opens up around people he trusts, but even then it’s hard for him to do it. A-Yuan has been good for him, I think. He wants to set good examples to counter all my bad ones.”</p>
<p>“I think you’re an excellent father,” Meng Yao told him. He found himself surprised to realize it was true. </p>
<p>“And I think that once you trust us, all those many smiles you have might be a bit more real.” Having dropped that heavy load into the air between them, he sat up and clapped his hands together. “Now, those buns have tormented me since we left.” </p>
<p>The promise of food tempted the boys back to the shore, and A-Yuan sat neatly between Meng Yao and Wei Wuxian even as Jingyi—taking his cue from Wei Wuxian—dropped down and leaned his full weight against Meng Yao.</p>
<p>After Meng Yao packed away the last crumbs of their lunch, enjoying the delighted smiles the small sweets earned the boys, Wei Wuxian took his dizi from his belt and began to play, watching as the boys returned to the water. </p>
<p>Meng Yao found himself… quite content. </p>
<p>Or he did, until Wei Wuxian paused his playing, brow drawn in concern, and the alarming sound of heavy branches snapping tore through the peace. Wei Wuxian jumped to his feet and Meng Yao shouted for the boys. </p>
<p>They obeyed, but barely had time to reach the shore before a beast broke through the treeline in front of the path back to the Unclean Realm. Meng Yao couldn’t tell what it had been before the resentful energy corrupted it entirely; it’s enormous body and broad horns looked bovine in appearance, but serrated tusks stretched down from its mouth—a horrible, gaping maw already bloodied with the meaty dregs of its last meal still hanging from its jowls. Bony plates covered its sides that ground against each other with each twitch of muscle. </p>
<p>“The boys,” Wei Wuxian shouted. He produced a talisman from his sleeve and threw it forward, a golden shield springing into place in the all-too-short distance between them. As soon as it fell into place, Wei Wuxian calmly lifted his dizi to his lips and played a single note. The white jade sword token hanging from the end glowed with brilliant ephemeral light, there and gone in a heartbeat. </p>
<p>Meng Yao got his arms around them, but the creature blocked their only retreat. The forest would hinder them more than it would the beast. It heaved with the force of its breath and pawed at the ground with knife-sharp hooves, as though waiting. </p>
<p>“It’s too big, baba,” A-Yuan whispered. </p>
<p>The beast charged and Wei Wuxian whipped out his sword. Meng Yao cringed; even a spiritual weapon would be hard-pressed to put so much as a mark on the heavily armoured flank.</p>
<p>The beast tore through the barrier as though it were paper, howling with a deafening crash of a house being shattered beneath a rockslide. Wei Wuxian darted towards it, the tip of his sword sliding into the space between two of the plates near its eyes. The beast howled and spun to tear after him. Meng Yao quickly considered the distance between himself, the beast and the path, and shook his head. </p>
<p>The space for Wei Wuxian to maneuver was dangerously small, and he was forced to leap into the air to dodge as great horns bucked towards him when the beast whipped its head. He was fast, but the angle of his ascent brought him too close to the creature’s lengthy fangs, and the tip dug into his left leg, opening it from knee to ankle. It tried to spin, momentarily captured by the thick vegetation around it. </p>
<p>Wei Wuxian landed in front of Meng Yao and stumbled, blood running freely down his legs. </p>
<p>Panic stuck in his lungs, Meng Yao said, “I cannot make it to the path.” He wasn’t fast enough when he had the boys tucked into his arms, and he wouldn’t abandon them. Not for anything. </p>
<p>Wei Wuxian considered this in silence. </p>
<p>“Help is coming,” he said confidently. “I can distract it until it arrives.” </p>
<p>“Until wh— <em>Wei Wuxian</em>!” Wei Wuxian dove back towards the creature as it freed itself, powering a talisman with one hand as he brought his sword to bear with the other. He jammed the point in between two of the plates and tossed the talisman inside, then danced away as the creature loosed a scream, smoke pouring out from the new opening. It lumbered forward, but its target was no longer Wei Wuxian. Pain and rage drove it forward, directly towards Meng Yao and the children. </p>
<p>Meng Yao whipped about and ran for the trees, boys tucked in his arms and Wei Wuxian screaming wordlessly behind him. The cover wouldn’t help. The beast could easily pick up the momentum it needed to catch up to them, and it had felled who knew how many trees in its initial charge. But if Meng Yao could just get to the treeline and hide the boys, maybe he could find a way to distract it long enough for Wei Wuxian to find an opening. </p>
<p>He practically felt the hot breath against the back of his neck as they reached the trees, he dropped to the ground, the boys tight to his chest and eyes squeezed shut. </p>
<p>Meng Yao missed his mother. </p>
<p>He supposed he wouldn’t have to much longer. </p>
<p>And then something warm and solid draped across his back and he was being born away, moved out of the path of the creature and deposited safely near the path. Meng Yao swung around, and all the breath left his lungs as he beheld the dragon. </p>
<p>Artwork, even the most exquisite examples he’d seen in his time in the Unclean Realm, did not do the majesty and power of the dragon justice. Scales shone in the sunlight with white opalescence that beggared description, covering a broadly muscled body easily longer than five men placed head to toe, the finest silver mane following along the long stretch of its back to the tip of its tail, the vaguest touch of cyan run through the individual strands. He would not dare call its shape serpentine, no. This was no snake, though superficially the long stretch of it might make the ignorant scramble for any potential comparison. It’s maw stretched back over a frightening row of diamond-sharp teeth, as the beast before it sailed through where Meng Yao and the boys had stood only a moment before. </p>
<p>Wei Wuxian wasted no time. He jumped forward, and the dragon caught him with the tip of its tail and slingshotted him further, to the top of the beast. Wei Wuxian stabbed his sword down between the beast’s plates below the shoulder, twisting it viciously and earning himself another roar. The beast jerked around, but the dragon pulled Wei Wuxian back and away before it could do so much as twitch to throw him off. Wei Wuxian ran up the dragon’s body and, upon reaching its head, used its horn as a handhold as the dragon whipped forward, snatching his sword back and away. </p>
<p>In all the stories Meng Yao heard, nothing indicated the dragons willingly fought alongside anyone except the Two Lords. Dimly, he decided it to be a promising development for his father; and yet the obvious trust between them seemed so profound he could not imagine forcing such a connection. </p>
<p>The dragon and Wei Wuxian moved together seamlessly, taking the beast apart piece by piece until Wei Wuxian managed to drive his sword deep into its neck and it toppled over without another whisper of sound or breath. They stilled, waiting, Wei Wuxian balanced on one of the dragon’s impressively muscled forelegs, until satisfied it would not rise again. </p>
<p>He yanked his sword out of the beast and cleaned it with a flick and flare of spiritual energy. The dragon, obviously less sanguine though Meng Yao couldn’t confidently say how he could tell, lowered its head and accepted Wei Wuxian’s hand upon its brow. He leaned his entire weight forward until half-balanced on the dragon’s snout, carefully avoiding the horn-tipped muzzle, and rested his forehead against the space between two very intelligent eyes. </p>
<p>And with that small intimacy, he jumped straight and turned towards Meng Yao and the boys. “Anyone injured?” </p>
<p>“No, Young Master Wei,” Meng Yao reported honestly, if hoarsely. The boys, taking the question as permission, both darted forward to grab onto Wei Wuxian’s legs. A-Yuan reached up until the dragon lowered its head to allow him to press a small palm against his face. </p>
<p>With a broad grin, Wei Wuxian coaxed him forward. “Meng Yao, come meet Hanguang-jun.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao stepped forward cautiously, eyes trained on the dragon. The dragon itself turned its attention towards him and Meng Yao froze in place under the intense scrutiny of impossibly vibrant eyes. </p>
<p>“They have names,” he said quietly. </p>
<p>Wei Wuxian shrugged guilelessly. “Most things do. Say hello properly.” </p>
<p>“Forgive me,” Meng Yao gasped. He bowed lower than he had even to Jiang Wanyin, when he still thought of him as Sect Leader Jiang. “This one is humbled and honoured to behold your greatness, Hanguang-jun.” </p>
<p>“No one ever says shit like that to me,” Wei Wuxian muttered. Meng Yao couldn’t help glaring. “Come, come.” </p>
<p>“Can… can dragons speak?” He took a few more steps forward, until he stood only a few feet away. He couldn’t bring himself to move any further. </p>
<p>“In their own way,” Wei Wuxian said with a fond smile. He trailed his fingers gently along the crest above Hanguang-jun’s eye, and the dragon seemed to sigh into the touch, huffing a breath that smelled of wet stone and petrichor. “We’ll find you at home, yeah?” </p>
<p>Hanguang-jun, alarmingly, nudged A-Yuan’s stomach with its snout and then jumped into the air with a gust of wind so powerful the boys were knocked onto their bottoms. Both children laughed in delight, popping up again almost as quickly and waving enthusiastically after the receding form. </p>
<p>“Meng Yao, you look like you need a drink,” Wei Wuxian stated after Hanguang-jun disappeared over the treetops. </p>
<p>Meng Yao mustered up a weak version of one of his more pleasant smiles. “Well, appearances can’t always be deceiving.” </p>
<p>Wei Wuxian laughed and gathered the boys up for the return walk home.</p><hr/>
<p>Over dinner that evening, during which Meng Yao did not see the bottom of his cup, Wei Wuxian regaled the table with the completely exaggerated and mostly fictitious story of Meng Yao's bravery, egged on by the boys who seemed to think it a faithful recounting of events.</p>
<p>"And then he threw himself right in front of the thing to shield the boys with his own body," Wei Wuxian claimed, oblivious to Lan Wangji slipping another sesame ball onto his plate. He and the boys had been doted on all night by Lan Wangji, albeit in a very subtle yet genuine way that made Meng Yao ache for reasons he did not care to examine. </p>
<p>Meng Yao finally felt confident to protest. "Young Master Wei not being fair. He and… Hanguang-jun dispatched the beast too quickly for this one to be of any use at all."</p>
<p>"Of course then he almost pissed in his robes in front of Hanguang-jun," Wei Wuxian snorted.</p>
<p>"Wuxian!" Meng Yao snapped, cheeks flaming with embarrassment.</p>
<p>The man grinned and dug his elbow into Jiang Wanyin's side. "See! I told you! Not even a month before he broke."</p>
<p>"So what? You annoying someone to distraction is nothing new!" Jiang Wanyin shouted before regarding Meng Yao with the longest-suffering look Meng Yao had ever seen. “I’m sure you did just fine. The first time this idiot met Hanguang-jun he acted so shamelessly I almost threw myself off the nearest cliff out of sheer secondhand embarrassment.”</p>
<p>“Unfair. We were nowhere near a cliff!” Wei Wuxian protested over Lan Wangji’s huff.</p>
<p>“<em>I would have found one</em>!”</p>
<p>“We’re very grateful to you for protecting the boys, Young Master Meng,” Jiang Yanli said with a kind smile. It effectively cut off any and all other teasing, for which he was exceedingly grateful. </p>
<p>Later, tucked into his room, he wrote a missive to his father describing the dragon, and tried to capture Hanguang-jun’s effortless strength. The words were innocent enough, but he tried to identify the appropriate tone to imply the difficulty of taming a being of such overwhelming power. He could not say he was successful, but without making potentially compromising direct statements regarding his father’s directive, it would have to do. </p>
<p>When he finished, he sat back on his heels. </p>
<p><em>I have seen a dragon,</em> he thought. In retrospect, he could barely count the single, fleeting glimpse he'd caught when Jingyi came to them. It could not compare. Something deep within his chest twisted at the idea of Hanguang-jun beholden to anyone and tramped it mercilessly down. This all had a purpose, and he needed to stay true.</p>
<p>Leaving the letter to dry, he rose and left the room for his nightly exploration. He knew the Unclean Realm almost as well as he knew Koi Tower by now. The corridors unfurled to him with welcome familiarity, the occupants all abed or tucked comfortably into their quarters for the evening. He made his way towards the main reception hall for nothing else than the chance to enjoy his solitude and examine his thoughts. </p>
<p>His time here proved dangerous. He’d become… attached to the people who he knew would surely have to be dealt with if his father’s plans were to succeed. Even from the short time he’d witnessed Wei Wuxian’s interaction with Hanguang-jun, he knew there to be not the meagrest amount of a chance that the man would allow harm to come to the dragons while he still drew breath. One way or another, the problem of Wei Wuxian would have to be addressed. </p>
<p>And this obviously did not take into consideration the Two Lords, unknown factors he could not account for until he’d met them in person and evaluated them as potential threats to his father’s machinations. </p>
<p>Of course, the night after he reached this conclusion, the Two Lords made their return to the Unclean Realm.</p><hr/>
<p>Once or twice during his evening walks, he made it as far as the very limits of the living areas, finding himself trailing along a surprisingly well-kept path leading to the edge of the treeline and into what appeared to be a deliberately cleared at the edge of a deep valley. He found himself appreciating the wild beauty of the mountains; a small footbridge had been erected over a quick-running stream that careened over a nearby cliffside into an expansive lake filling the valley below. On the other end of the bridge, the pathway disappeared, leaving only untended land trailing towards the mountains. It had been where he’d witnessed Lan Wangji collect Jingyi, and he found himself often trailing back to the spot for its peaceful air as much as its promise of solitude. The grass, he noted, was completely trampled into the dirt to leave a bare stretch of mostly-smooth land stretching towards the nearest of the mountains. </p>
<p>That night, his solitude was interrupted when rain-scented fog descended upon him seconds before the dragon. </p>
<p>The earth beneath his feet shook with the power of its landing and Meng Yao stumbled back, eyes wide. This was not Huangang-jun. The bare glow of the crescent moon revealed only dark scales and a head crowned with wicked spiralled horns and a broader expanse of fur, very different from Hanguang-jun’s clean lines and effortless elegance. Enormous in size, this dragon must have been at least another half size larger than its counterpart, and blazing eyes fixed upon Meng Yao immediately. </p>
<p>It took him a long moment to realize it bore a man upon its back, and longer to react when the man slumped forward and slid to the ground. The dragon’s eyes widened, its attention snapping towards its fallen rider. </p>
<p>Meng Yao moved forward, though he froze a precious second later when the dragon swang back to him and bared its teeth. </p>
<p>Meng Yao bowed. “Great and honourable dragon, please let this unworthy one see if he can assist,” Meng Yao said. “Even at a run, help will be a few minutes off.” </p>
<p>The dragon, still as a statue, regarded him with eyes piercing as a sword through his chest, threatening to cleave him in twain. Finally, it raised its head and loosed a bellow into the air. Had a tempest been trapped within a box and the lid lifted for only a moment, it could not have made a sound to rival that call of the dragon. Yet, when it lowered its head once more it moved to allow Meng Yao closer. </p>
<p>The man on the ground bled freely through a mighty gash across his abdomen, and even with a pallid face twisted in pain he remained the most beautiful man Meng Yao had beheld in all his life. He cried out when Meng Yao placed his hands upon the wound, transferring what meagre amount of spiritual energy he could to stem the bleeding and placing enough pressure to slow the steady flow. The dragon… hovered. Not literally, but it remained close enough to remind Meng Yao of a worried party waiting outside a healer’s room. </p>
<p>Meng Yao was no healer, and his efforts felt futile, but he was determined. After all, the white ribbon resting tight across his forehead, though stained with blood, all but confirmed the man whose guts were currently being held in place solely through Meng Yao’s efforts was the Lord of Jade. </p>
<p>It took long minutes before the sounds of help arriving filled the air. Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji spilled from the treeline, swords drawn and in the complete disarray of the recently awakened. They wore simple sleep robes, hair unbound, a wild look about them both. For all that, the truly shocking sight was the absence of Lan Wangji's forehead ribbon, until Meng Yao realized it to be lovingly tied around Wei Wuxian's wrist.</p>
<p>Wei Wuxian stumbled to a halt. “Chifeng-zun?” </p>
<p>“Brother,” Lan Wangji breathed in the same moment. He darted ahead of Wei Wuxian, dropping next to Meng Yao to begin pressing his own, much more substantial spiritual power into the wound. Broad hands rested alongside Meng Yao’s, and sharp tingles ran up his arms at the close proximity to the sheer volume of power Lan Wangji passed along. </p>
<p>“What happened?” Wei Wuxian demanded. </p>
<p>It took Meng Yao an embarrassingly long moment to realize the question to be aimed at him. “I was out walking and happened to be here when the… when Chifeng-zun landed. The Lord of Jade was already injured.” </p>
<p>“It’s after midnight,” Wei Wuxian pointed out.</p>
<p>“I am not an easy sleeper,” Meng Yao replied.</p>
<p>“Not the time,” Lan Wangji hissed. The bleeding slowed enough for him to gesture Wei Wuxian forward. “Let’s bring him to his rooms.” He paused and looked at Meng Yao from across his brother’s body. “Thank you.” </p>
<p>Breathless with shock, Meng Yao sat back on his heels as they collected the Lord of Jade carefully between them and carried him back towards the family quarters. He stared after them, heart twisting peculiarly in his chest. He… had he ever been thanked before? For anything? Surely, once in his life, he must have been. Yet he failed to call to mind a single instance. </p>
<p>His hands were slippery with blood and he stared down at them, gaze trailing up along the ruined sleeves of his robes. </p>
<p>No, no, no. The blood needed to come off before it flung him all the way back to his mother’s side. The phantom sense of her heaving ragged coughs in his arms and gagging on blood with every breath threatened to overwhelm him. He darted to the stream and desperately plunged his hands into the water, smashing his hands together to clean them. He could not have blood on his hands again. He could not. </p>
<p>The dragon waited nearby. In all the blistering panic of the situation, he’d almost forgotten the dragon to even be present, though he could not conceive of such a thing now. It watched as he stuck his hands into the water, the bank yielding to elbow-deep water and stinging with the frigidity of a glacier-fed stream. </p>
<p>“This unworthy one apologizes,” he whispered, wishing he might’ve waited until he had the chance to bow, but the sudden desire to rid himself of the gore could not be ignored. “I could not do more.” </p>
<p>The dragon considered him closely, then huffed and launched itself into the sky. </p>
<p>It didn’t occur to Meng Yao until much, much later how significantly easier acquiring a dragon might have proven if he’d applied pressure in a slightly different fashion, and let the Lord of Jade die beneath his hands.</p><hr/>
<p>Unlike the evening meal, to which everyone connected to the Household of the Two Lords was quite obviously expected to attend, mornings were significantly less organized. Those who didn’t request a meal brought to their rooms drifted in and out of the main hall, attended to by servants accustomed to the disparate habits of an eclectic mix of persons. Sometimes Meng Yao found himself alone breaking his fast, though rarely. His own habits overlapped with Jin Zixuan’s enough that they frequently ate together in polite silence, slightly strained by the fact that neither of them seemed to have a single clue as to what they could say to one another, even despite Jin Zixuan’s decision to call him brother. They often exhausted safe topics of conversation within a few minutes, and while Jin Zixuan often looked like he wanted to speak more, he erred on the side of caution. </p>
<p>Walking through the doors that morning, Meng Yao was shocked to see Nie Huaisang seated at the table. To the best of his knowledge, the other man shared Wei Wuxian’s habit of sleeping late and staying up later, and Meng Yao certainly hadn’t seen him at breakfast before. </p>
<p>The surprise faded when he realized that one of the two grand seats at the front of the room to now be occupied. </p>
<p>It was not the Lord of Jade. Indeed, considering the depth and extent of his injury Meng Yao would have been surprised to see him up and about so quickly. Thus, the man before him had to be the Lord of Blades, Nie Mingjue. He wore the heavy robes of the Nie, practically armour in their own right, and his face reminded Meng Yao of the crust atop a pool of lava. Meng Yao’s steps faltered, which only served to draw their attention to him. </p>
<p>He bowed as deeply to the Lord of Blades as he had to Chifeng-zun the night before. </p>
<p>“Da-ge,” Huaisang said, snapping his fan shut with far too much art. “This is Young Master Meng Yao.”</p>
<p>Nie Mingjue’s attention came upon him as a lodestone pressed against his back. Waiting for acknowledgement, he barely noticed the man himself rising and approaching until he stood before Meng Yao to tuck hands under his arms and draw him upwards. </p>
<p>The Lord of Jade remained the most beautiful man Meng Yao ever beheld. The softening of the hard features of the Lord of Blades made his breath catch nonetheless. </p>
<p>“I owe you a debt, Meng Yao,” he stated. Nie Huaisang made a noise behind him, though Meng Yao would’ve been hard pressed to describe it. “I’ve been apprised of your actions last night, which will contribute to a swifter recovery for Xichen. I pay my debts.” </p>
<p>A hard lump sat in Meng Yao’s throat, a steel spike driven through flesh and sticking into his spine until he found himself immobilized by the weight of the words and the presence of the man before him. </p>
<p>Before he could reveal too much of himself, he bowed again. “It is my honour to be of service.” </p>
<p>A shift, and then Nie Huaisang’s voice: “Yes, every time.” </p>
<p>Once again, Nie Mingjue lifted him to stand straight. “Join us for our meal, Meng Yao. I would like to know more about you.”</p>
<p>More intimidated than he’d been since the first, cautious step onto the Koi Tower stairs, Meng Yao crossed to share the table with Nie Huaisang.</p><hr/>
<p>Lan Xichen woke up feeling as though consciousness was unwise. </p>
<p>This assessment was quickly confirmed by both the pain in his abdomen and the glowering presence of his husband sat at his bedside. </p>
<p>“How are you feeling?” Mingjue demanded gruffly. </p>
<p>Lan Xichen took a moment to consider before replying, “Tender.” </p>
<p>This proved to not be the answer Mingjue was looking for. “If you ever do that to me again…” </p>
<p>When they’d first met, doubtless Mingjue would have found a very vicious, if not creative, way to finish the sentence. Now he just looked tired. Lan Xichen reached out a hand, relieved when Mingjue immediately grabbed it up in his own. Nothing irreparable, then. A relief, to be sure. There were few things he could weather with poorer grace than Mingjue’s temper when aimed in his direction. </p>
<p>He squeezed the fingers trapped against his own and Mingjue heaved out a frustrated breath. He tucked his free hand beneath Xichen’s robe to examine the mostly-closed injury, allowing Lan Xichen a moment to mentally focus himself. The familiar sense of his brother’s spiritual energy sat heavy in his veins, replenishing his own and fortifying his strength as his body worked to heal. And beneath that, almost an aftertaste after a small sip of sweet wine, something else. Weak, perhaps, but present. </p>
<p>“What happened?” he asked, eyes opening even as his brow drew in confusion. </p>
<p>“After that Wen-dog tried to gut you? Or do you need a refresher on that as well?” </p>
<p>Lan Xichen winced. Mingjue was obviously furious, and he frankly couldn’t blame him. They’d agreed, when they decided to deal with the lingering threat of Wen Xu and his ilk, no unnecessary risks now the war was over. That had been before Wen Xu had made another move on Cloud Recesses.</p>
<p>“I remember that part,” he said with a gentle incline of his chin, the best he could manage while lying down. He shifted to try and sit up, only for Mingjue to release his hand and push him back down. "It gave you and Uncle the opening required."</p>
<p>"Lan Xichen, if you're telling me you deliberately let yourself be eviscerated, I will be very, very angry." Baxia twitched from her place in the sword stand beside the door, Shouyue a pale shadow as the sabre quaked with Mingjue's rage.</p>
<p>"I didn't expect him to be able to land the blow," Lan Xichen replied honestly. Since when had either of Wen Ruohan's sons posed a significant threat beyond what they could do to the helpless? Their strength always came from the forces they commanded. Wen Xu may have been more martially competent than his younger brother, but Lan Xichen had only ever seen him as an extension of his father. An extension, Lan Xichen mused angrily, that had perpetrated terrible deeds when he had no fear of repercussions. </p>
<p>"Never underestimate your opponent. Isn't that written on your wall?"</p>
<p>"'Be respectful of the skills of others, both known and unknown,'" he quoted. "'Never take for granted your superiority.'"</p>
<p>"I should tell your uncle, but I'd prefer you recover under my hands than his."</p>
<p>Mn. Uncle could be a bit of a mother hen. "I have always loved being under your hands."</p>
<p>Mingjue smirked, though it faded quickly. "At least Wen Xu is dead.”</p>
<p>Xichen took in a grateful breath. When Wen Xu had struck at him, it gave Uncle the opening to land a blow and disable his arm long enough for Mingjue to finish him, separating head from shoulders. Finally. Two years after the Sunshot Campaign officially ended, perhaps now he and Mingjue could find some peace.</p>
<p>When Wex Xu escaped, shortly before his father's death, Lan Xichen had been so eager to return home he'd been willing to overlook potential consequences. Wen Xu’s proclivities towards cruelty were well-known, but without his father's support he occurred as nothing more than a child looking for validation through negative behaviour.</p>
<p>They hadn't expected him to blood dozens of men in the two years since his father's death and launch an offensive against Cloud Recesses. Thank goodness for the improved strength of the wards, or else he might have seen his home burn once again.</p>
<p>“Of course, you might have mentioned to me the wound was so grievous before deciding to fly home and then falling out of the sky when your intestines decided they were sick of being confined.” The acerbicy of the tone made Lan Xichen wince, but he supposed he deserved it. </p>
<p>“I had no idea it was as bad as it was, Mingjue. I wouldn’t have risked my life unnecessarily.” If anything, the flight had simply aggravated it more than he’d expected. </p>
<p>“You’re lucky we were close to the Unclean Realm when you finally passed out. Had we been of any real distance… <em>A-Huan</em>...” His grip tightened to the point of breaking Lan Xichen’s fingers, but he couldn’t fault his husband the concern. He longed to sit up and wrap his arms around Mingjue’s shoulders, but knowing Mingjue would not thank him for the efforts kept him in place. </p>
<p>“And then…?”</p>
<p>Mingjue took a moment to calm himself, fixing his gaze out the nearby window with gritted teeth until he breathed out and the tension eased incrementally from his shoulders. “Then you were attended by our new friend, Meng Yao.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao. Yes. Wangji had mentioned him when Lan Xichen had escaped the field to deliver Lan Jingyi into the care of his brother. The assessment hadn’t been particularly flattering, though Lan Xichen was willing to chalk such things up to Wangji’s natural recalcitrance. Apparently Nie Huaisang had concerns about his trustworthiness, though he couldn’t yet offer an explanation to merit it beyond something regarding a painted fan. Lan Xichen had decided to follow up with Huaisang directly, supposing he’d missed something essential in the secondhand message from his brother, but obviously the abrupt nature of his homecoming changed things. </p>
<p>"I shall need to thank him."</p>
<p>"I took the liberty on your behalf yesterday morning.” Mingjue huffed. “After he found his voice he made a point of asking after you, and then a number of pointed questions about where our dragons were kept and how they fared."</p>
<p>Lan Xichen frowned in confusion. "What?"</p>
<p>"If no one else has decided to enlighten him, I'll follow their lead. Wuxian and Zixuan want to talk to us about it once you’re feeling better. They apparently half-abducted him from Jin Guangshan, and we both know what sort of man he is." </p>
<p>"Indeed," Lan Xichen winced. "I do wish Yanli-jie had found someone else to give her heart to, even though Jin Zixuan hasn't proved the same odious scum as his sire."</p>
<p>"Strong words, husband. You must still be in pain."</p>
<p>"I speak as I say."</p>
<p>Mingjue snorted. "Like hell."</p>
<p>Lan Xichen mustered up a small smile and shifted on the bed. "Join me?"</p>
<p>"Only for a minute. Jiang Cheng is waiting on me to review the business we missed."</p><hr/>
<p>Within three days of waking, irritation at the spousal-enforced bedrest stung at Lan Xichen like a hornet aiming for a sensitive place. While their extended family offered a constant parade of faces eager to see and entertain him, he ached to walk the halls of the Unclean Realm and enjoy a view other than the same four walls. </p>
<p>Wangji and Mingjue, his most regular companions, remained unsympathetic, both being of the opinion that he'd brought the convalescence upon himself. Yanli-jie brought him food and gentle smiles and, on one notable occasion, her betrothed who agreed Lan Xichen had conducted himself well but declined to repeat the sentiment to Mingjue, which either showed good judgement or a lack of backbone depending on the generosity of interpretation. </p>
<p>Jiang Cheng, as was his wont, yelled. "What would I have done if you'd died, hmm? Dealt with all the Gusu bullshit on top of everything in Yunmeng? Am I supposed to be the one to tell Lan Qiren there's no budget for another wing on the library? You think I want that?"</p>
<p>He and Mingjue really did share some remarkable similarities. Mingjue's anger burned no less hot, but Jiang Cheng's ran quicker to the surface. The only reason his appendages remained unthreatened was, presumably, because Jiang Cheng knew it wouldn't truly hinder him.</p>
<p>"I am very relieved you were here to keep things in such good order, A-Cheng," Lan Xichen told him.</p>
<p>Flustered by the compliment, but still outraged, Jiang Cheng very deliberately did not ask if he needed anything for his comfort when he left. A small meal was brought in within minutes of his departure however, and Lan Xichen smiled softly into the bowl.</p>
<p>Huaisang, the most reliable visitor after Wangji and Mingjue, bored him with the pettiest, most frivolous gossip he could find as punishment for allowing himself to be hurt. The point was well-made, and Lan Xichen would have to work very, very hard in order to avoid allowing some of the choicer morsels to impact his behaviour towards certain other residents of the Unclean Realm. A long-lasting torture, and doubtless A-Sang’s intention.</p>
<p>Far and away, though, his favourite visitor quickly became Wei Wuxian. Not for the boisterous nature of his concern, though that was refreshingly uncomplicated, but in that he was often accompanied by his two young charges. They played well off each other; Jingyi more temperate, A-Yuan more willing to speak up. In both cases, Wei Wuxian beamed with sheer delight.</p>
<p>A great weight lifted off his mind to see Jingyi bouncing back so quickly. When he'd brought the boy to the Unclean Realm and left him again almost immediately, he'd also left his fears that the boy would not recover from the wounds left behind by Wen Xu's attack. He’d given half a mind to adopting Jingyi himself, had Mingjue been onboard with the idea, but doing it now seemed cruel, when the small family already seemed content. Wuxian and Wangji had managed to hold off on adopting a small maelstrom of children already to ensure A-Yuan settled properly; he could only imagine the encroaching storm now the floodgates were open. </p>
<p>Even with the steady stream of visitors, bedrest did not agree with him, and after Yanli-jie left him the morning of his fourth day conscious, Lan Xichen quickly dressed and escaped the room before another well-meaning family member showed up to entertain him. He’d managed a simple topknot and his usual hairpiece, and while he felt naked without the Nie plaits he’d started wearing shortly after binding himself to Mingjue, he couldn’t risk seeking his husband out and being bullied back to bed while replacing them. </p>
<p>Sneaking through his own home felt undignified, but still preferable to another moment trapped in his own room. He held no illusions he'd be found out sooner rather than later. Hopefully his destination—his favourite garden, tucked away deep in the recesses of the Unclean Realm and often overlooked by the other inhabitants—would be considered restful enough to let him avoid any overly concerned objections.</p>
<p>Shock bolted through him when he entered the garden and saw someone already seated on the lone bench within. </p>
<p>It had to be Meng Yao, of course. No other stranger would be permitted this deep into the family area of the Unclean Realm. Mingjue had described him well; a handsome face, though currently set with deep grooves of concern. What burdened him? </p>
<p>It took only a moment for him to notice Lan Xichen standing at the garden entrance. He leapt to his feet and bowed.</p>
<p>"Lord of Jade." His voice sounded familiar, probably from when Lan Xichen bled all over him. "This one is sorry for his intrusion on your peace."</p>
<p>"If anything, I am intruding on yours." Had Lan Xichen been closer, he would have pulled the other man straight. Then again, as he closed the distance between them, there seemed no immediate inclination to rise anyway. Lan Xichen pulled him up to find a pleasant smile had replaced the worry hanging on his brow. This, he had prepared himself for as well. Huaisang complained about it at length. "I'm not accustomed to others being here."</p>
<p>"I will leave you, then," Meng Yao offered. "Or fetch more pleasant company?"</p>
<p>"I have yet to find <em>un</em>pleasant company," Lan Xichen assured him. He gestured towards the bench. "Shall we sit? I understand I owe you my improved health, if not my life, and I should like to know you better."</p>
<p>Meng Yao's cheeks flushed prettily, but he acquiesced and sat next to Lan Xichen. “I hope it’s not an inconvenience for me to be here. Only, I’m usually with the boys at this time, but they’ve both expressed an interest in learning musical cultivation and it was determined Lan Wangji would be the best teacher. They’re with him now practicing the guqin.” </p>
<p>“You had no desire to learn?” A slight disappointment, quickly dismissed by Meng Yao’s pursed lips and fleeting look of longing.</p>
<p>“It is a gentleman’s instrument, Lord of Jade, and I am but a servant.”</p>
<p>“I have always believed courtesy and an earnest desire for learning are the truest measures of a gentleman, regardless of station. If you did desire to learn, I’m sure Wangji would be happy to accommodate you.” Or, hopefully more likely to be received, “Even myself if you would prefer a more… adult environment.” </p>
<p>A smile stole across Meng Yao’s face, though he maintained his strict ground-bound gaze. “I will consider your offer, Lord of Jade. Thank you.”</p>
<p>Their conversation drifted towards the boys and Meng Yao’s experience with the Unclean Realm since his arrival. As Mingjue had alluded to, more than one question seemed rather pointedly aimed towards the subject of dragons, though none of them struck him as inherently inappropriate. He answered gamely, if shallowly, and Meng Yao offered no sign of frustration or irritation. </p>
<p>Engrossing as their conversation was, it took both of them longer than it should have to notice Mingjue hovering beneath the garden entrance. To all appearances deeply irritated, though Lan Xichen fancied he knew his husband well enough by now to detect the fond understanding beneath.</p>
<p>“Your brother is unhappy with you,” Mingjue stated once they noticed him, crossing the garden towards them. Meng Yao jumped up to bow, but Mingjue waved him off. </p>
<p>“Which one?” Lan Xichen asked placidly. </p>
<p>“The loud one.” Ah, it had been Jiang Cheng’s turn to check on him, then. Little wonder they hadn’t heard him hollering from across the Unclean Realm. Mingjue moved to stand behind them and began fixing his hair. Lan Xichen eased back into the touch. Meng Yao refocused his attention on the garden path before them, obviously unaccustomed to such open and easy intimacies. It spoke more of the situation at Koi Tower than anything, Lan Xichen thought as Mingjue redressed his complicated plaits and reset his guan. </p>
<p>“Will I stop embarrassing you now?” Lan Xichen asked once Mingjue reseated his guan. </p>
<p>Mingjue snorted. “Doubtful.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao paled, but Lan Xichen laughed which seemed to put him at ease. </p>
<p>Very curious, their new resident.</p><hr/>
<p>Meng Yao walked the boys through the hallways to the room kept by Lan Wangji during the day. All of them had their own spaces outside their rooms to sit and occupy themselves with that they would. Even Meng Yao, though he’d quickly transformed his into the utilitarian space used for conducting lessons. </p>
<p>Next to him, Jingyi sang under his breath. “Gonna learn some more guqin, gonna be the best that’s ever played.”</p>
<p>Alas for Jingyi’s musical ambitions, the poor boy invariably dropped every note he attempted to carry, and would likely have to find his passions elsewhere.</p>
<p>Meng Yao knocked and waited for the three of them to be summoned inside. There was a momentary sound of scuffling before a very familiar voice issued a sunny command to enter, quite unlike Lan Wangji’s more soft spoken entreatments.</p>
<p>Sure enough, when Meng Yao opened the door, Wei Wuxian stood next to Lan Wangji’s desk, robes slightly askew and with a healthy flush to his cheeks. </p>
<p>“Wei Wuxian, Lan Wangji.” Meng Yao bowed, at which Wei Wuxian offered an exaggerated roll of the eyes. “I’ve brought your charges. Jingyi sang a very clever song today about calligraphy and was eager to come to his lessons and share it with you.” </p>
<p>“Mn.” Lan Wangji waved the boys to the two guqins set up in front of him, and the boys hastened to take their seats. “Thank you, Meng Yao. I will return them to you at the usual time.” </p>
<p>“Lan Zhan, can I stay?” </p>
<p>Lan Wangji levelled Wei Wuxian with a sly look, a flicker of expression that the unobservant may have missed. “If you are willing to participate in the lesson.” </p>
<p>Wei Wuxian took his dizi and twirled it around his fingers. “I’ll just see Meng Yao out.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao allowed Wei Wuxian to usher him out the door. In the hallway, checking to make sure the door was closed, he turned his blinding grin on Meng Yao. “Jingyi did the same with us at bedtime last night. Sat there singing 'need to get to sleep, need to get to sleep, why am I still up, it's no fair A-Yuan isn't talking to me.' And then sang 'it's not fair' in refrain about fifty times before finally conking out. Got pretty catchy after a while. Lan Zhan wont let me put it to music, but I think I can wear him down if you help me.”</p>
<p>“You are a menace, Wei Wuxian.” </p>
<p>Wei Wuxian grinned. “I am at that. And I thought we’d decided I was Wuxian, finally.” </p>
<p>“I have no memory of this decision.”</p>
<p>“Ah, Meng Yao, you’re so cruel to this poor man.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao rolled his eyes and dismissed himself. He didn’t get far—he was still close enough to hear the door open and close behind him and Wei Wuxian’s admonishments that the class had started without him—but paused in step when the sound of music caught his attention. It was beautiful, the player an obvious master of his or her craft. Meng Yao followed the sound until he came to an open door and found himself looking into the private room of Lan Xichen. The man in question noticed him almost immediately and his fingers fell still on his guqin. </p>
<p>Meng Yao dropped into a bow. “Forgive me, I heard the music, and—”</p>
<p>“There is no need to apologize, Young Master Meng,” Lan Xichen assured him. Meng Yao rose from his bow. “You’re here to take the boys to Wangji.” </p>
<p>“Yes. I’m sorry to have disturbed you.” </p>
<p>His smile gentled. “You did not. Would you like to come in? It’s been many weeks since I’ve had the chance to play and I found the need to reacquaint myself with my instrument.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao slipped into the room and allowed himself to be waved into the seat opposite Lan Xichen. The Lord of Jade tugged his sleeves up and began to play once more. The music was soothing, and Meng Yao allowed himself to drift into it, cares all easily forgotten in the easy calm of the sound. </p>
<p>He opened his eyes when the last note drifted through the air and offered Lan Xichen a sincere smile. “Thank you, Lord of Jade.”</p>
<p>“I believe A-Cheng convinced you to call him Lan Wanyin. May I be extended the same courtesy?” </p>
<p>“I have no desire to be discourteous,” Meng Yao said. His desires were much worse, of course, but there was never a call for discourtesy. “Lan Xichen.” </p>
<p>It earned him a smile, and reconfirmed his belief in the other man’s objective beauty. “Have you considered my offer of teaching you to play?" </p>
<p>“I could not impose upon your time,” Meng Yao protested.</p>
<p>“It’s not an imposition, I assure you. While I prefer the xiao as an instrument, I do love playing the guqin, and teaching another person will greatly enhance my enjoyment of it.” Lan Xichen met his eyes. “In which case, it would be a personal favour to allow me to teach you.” </p>
<p>It had to be an exaggeration, but it was certainly a kind one. </p>
<p>The next day, after he’d brought the boys to Lan Wangji, he once again made his way to Lan Xichen’s room. Inside, a second guqin had been set up across from Lan Xichen’s, and the man himself waved to Meng Yao with a smile. </p>
<p>“Let’s begin.”</p><hr/>
<p>Lessons continued abreast; Lan Xichen was an excellent teacher, and Meng Yao dedicated himself to learning. As Jin Zixuan had said, he’d rarely had the opportunity for purely recreational activities. Sitting across from Lan Xichen, more than occasionally shifting his eyes up to watch the serenity of his countenance while he played, became a daily occurrence, moments of peace Meng Yao had never expected nor looked for. </p>
<p>Nie Mingjue joined them occasionally, though his interest apparently less in the music and more in the company, reviewing records and muttering to himself as he read through whatever business crossed his desk. He was first and foremost Sect Leader Nie, after all, and Lord of Blades second. While his Head Disciple took care of training his cadre of cultivators, there was still work to be done on the daily, and the crease in his brow seemed to grow deeper every hour. </p>
<p>One afternoon, he interrupted Meng Yao’s lessons with a frustrated growl. </p>
<p>“Mingjue?” Lan Xichen asked, his fingers pausing on the strings. </p>
<p>“This doesn’t work,” he stated, glaring down at the documents before him. </p>
<p>Meng Yao ventured a curious glance at the records. Some sort of inventory manifest; something that should have been shuffled off into hands with less important matters to attend to, rather than the Sect Leader himself. “May I ask?” </p>
<p>“The administrator who usually looks over this has given birth, and is spending time with wife and child. I can’t pull her away from them, but this entire business...” </p>
<p>He waved at the papers, and Meng Yao took it as an invitation, which it probably was not. Meng Yao shifted around, guqin temporarily forgotten. He twisted the papers around to look at them properly and took a few moments to review the information. </p>
<p>“I think I understand the problem,” he said. The deceptively simple details hid implications more far-reaching than suggested on paper. He picked up Nie Mingjue’s brush and began to jot down notes, losing himself in the simple joys of administrative competence—his usual escape from the realities of Koi Tower, though he’d had little opportunity in the Unclean Realm. </p>
<p>At some point, a cup of tea appeared at his elbow and he drank it absently, his other hand continuing to scribble down plentiful remarks. He barely grimaced over the taste of it.</p>
<p>He looked up only seconds later to find the sun had set. Lan Xichen had disappeared, though Nie Mingjue remained seated across from him, apparently meditating as he awaited Meng Yao’s attention. </p>
<p>“I’m so sorry,” Meng Yao said, abashed.</p>
<p>Nie Mingjue’s eyes opened to slits. “Why? You’ve probably saved me days of frustration.”</p>
<p>“It’s not my place.” If he were exposed to too many of the Unclean Realm’s records, it would give him even more information to feed his father, and he already found himself hesitating to report on what he’d learned. </p>
<p>Nie Mingjue regarded him carefully. “It could be. I’m not saying your talents are wasted on the boys—you do them good service, and I know that Wangji and Wuxian find you invaluable—but it can’t be enough to fully occupy you.”</p>
<p>Meng Yao’s lips pressed into a thin line. “If… it would help.”</p>
<p>“It would.” Nie Mingjue tilted his chin towards the instruments behind them. “I won’t take you away from your lessons again, but perhaps you won’t mind me stealing some of your time in the late afternoon tomorrow?”</p>
<p>He couldn’t refuse; it was, after all, the entire reason Wei Wuxian thought to bring him to the Unclean Realm in the first place. “If you have faith in my abilities, it would be my honour to assist.” </p>
<p>Nie Mingjue looked at him—really looked—and for a horrifying second Meng Yao worried he betrayed more than he meant to. It only lasted a moment, but it left Meng Yao feeling vulnerable and Seen. “Thank you.”</p>
<p>Aflush, and with a wrench in his chest, Meng Yao stood, bowed, and wished the other man a pleasant evening.</p><hr/>
<p>‘Some of his time’ quickly turned into a regular occurence. Despite misgivings, Meng Yao found the work fulfilling. Nie Mingjue surpassed basic proficiency when it came to such business, but lacked the patience for it, and Lan Xichen admitted his uncle tended to most of the Lan Sect concerns and thus he was not intimately acquainted with the necessary skillset. Meng Yao doubted the truth of the statement, but saw it for the kindness it was. Finding a use for him beyond his tutelage of A-Yuan and Jingyi tied him even closer to the Unclean Realm, and in any other situation it would have a way of embracing him as a member of the household. </p>
<p>As such, his gut cradled the truth of it like a rock trapped inside his stomach. </p>
<p>He wrote to his father, insisting that there was no regular sign of the dragons. He suspected they kept themselves to the mountains save when called. How else could Hanguang-jun have reached them so quickly when they’d been attacked? There was certainly nowhere in the Unclean Realm they could be occupying without his knowledge. He knew every corner, now. </p>
<p>Jin Guangshan rarely replied, but the admonishments when he did rarely varied in severity, coached within pleasantries. How <em>pleased</em> he was that Meng Yao had found such a prestigious place in the household. How <em>valued</em> Meng Yao must feel. Perhaps if he focused his efforts on proving himself to them, he might sincerely win their trust instead of being morseled out crumbs of faith easily swept away. </p>
<p>Jin Zixuan caught him unawares after receiving one such letter, coming upon him in one of the sprawling gardens Meng Yao sought out for some quiet. </p>
<p>“Meng Yao?” He looked up and quickly shoved the letter up his sleeve. There was nothing inherently condemning in it, but surely Jin Zixuan knew their father well enough to read between the lines. Before Meng Yao could stand, he held up a hand. “I…” He frowned, consternated. “You need not feel obligated to reply to him, you know.” </p>
<p>“What do you mean?” Meng Yao asked. “Sect Leader Jin honours me by continuing correspondence after I’ve left the service of his household.” The words sat bitter in his mouth.</p>
<p>Jin Zixuan tilted his head and pursed his lips—a tell with which Meng Yao had long familiarity; it meant he wanted to say something but struggled to express himself. He imagined Jiang Yanli had passing familiarity with it as well. “Do as you will. Only,” he blinked rapidly, as though shocked at himself, “If he’s unwilling to pay you the respects he might pay a son, do not concern yourself with paying him the respects you might pay a father.” </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Meng Yao’s eyes widened, and Jin Zixuan turned on his heel and strode off across the garden, shoulders hunched almost to his ears. </p>
<p>He did eventually reply, of course, urging his father to be patient. It had only been a few months, after all, and the Two Lords hoarded their secrets closely. He paused and added a point to tell his father he would only write further if he had something worth mentioning. </p>
<p>Satisfied, he set his attention to the upcoming talks with the Zhu, a minor sect looking for an advantageous agreement with the Unclean Realm.</p><hr/>
<p>Showing up earlier than an agreed-upon hour when conducting negotiations was an underhanded trick used to catch a potential trade partner wrong-footed and give yourself an advantage. It forced the other party to rush through preparations for hospitality, and once negotiations began the lack of preparedness tended to sit in the room like a third party, waiting for acknowledgement and eyeing the host with disdain. Meng Yao encouraged his father towards such tactics on more than one occasion and it always led to him coming out with a greater result than expected.</p>
<p>He’d never known how terrible it felt to be on the other side. </p>
<p>“Wei Wuxian!” he half-yelled, walking far faster than one should in polite society. The man in question looked up from where he stood in the main hall, entertaining Jingyi and A-Yuan with a broad smile. </p>
<p>“Meng Yao, come. We’re just practicing sword forms!” With chopsticks, it seemed. </p>
<p>“Thank you, but I cannot. The Zhu delegation is here earlier than expected, and I can’t find Nie Mingjue or Lan Xichen. Jiang Wanyin is conducting the greetings, but they’ll be needed right away to commence proceedings.”</p>
<p>Wei Wuxian stroked his chin. “I think they’re up at the landing.” Near the footbridge, then, at the vast space near the cliff.</p>
<p>“Thank you again.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao took off, this time at a dead run. He’d already sent word to the kitchens and Jiang Yanli to host for the time being, but too much of a delay would put them at an even greater disadvantage than he wanted to imagine. The Zhu’s home bordered one of the greatest river markets anywhere, and having them as friends meant easier access and fewer tariffs of any number of goods which could not be found naturally in the Unclean Realm. These discussions were essential to the welfare of Qinghe and Meng Yao was determined to ensure they went as smoothly as possible. Now every effort would be undermined with their untimely arrival. </p>
<p>Perhaps it was because he had taken the lead on arranging the reception for the delegation. The pressing need to do well, to prove himself as more than a competent tutor for the boys and casual aid for Nie Mingjue, consumed him for reasons which didn’t bear thinking about. He could tell himself all he wanted it was to ingratiate himself to the Two Lords, but that stopped holding water weeks ago, when he’d first sat down with Lan Xichen to strum out those careful first notes on the guqin for no other reason than his personal pleasure. </p>
<p>He broke away from the trees and stumbled to a halt, eyes widening when he beheld not only Nie Mingjue, but the dragon with him. It was, perhaps, less of a shock this time (lies, it would never stop robbing the breath from his lungs) and Meng Yao credited his other two experiences with the dragons with how he was able to recover himself so quickly. </p>
<p>At first he thought it to be Hanguang-jun. Obviously it couldn’t be Chifeng-zun, with the magnificent white of its scales, but a few steps closer and he realized himself to be mistaken. This dragon had some superficial similarities to Hanguang-jun; their colouring looked quite close. But this dragon was larger, and when it turned its head Meng Yao’s way, he could see the subtle differences in the face and arrangements of its magnificent horns, as well as the shape of the impressive silver-blue mane running along the length of its back. </p>
<p>There were more than two dragons. </p>
<p>Meng Yao would examine this fact later, when the Zhu weren’t waiting on them. </p>
<p>Nie Mingjue stood on the ground near the dragon’s shoulder, a broad wire brush in hand. “What’s the matter?” </p>
<p>Meng Yao bowed. “I’m sorry to intrude, but the Zhu have arrived half a day earlier than expected, and you and Lan Xichen are needed.” </p>
<p>Nie Mingjue huffed. “Xichen isn’t available at the moment, so they’ll have to settle for me.” Meng Yao very carefully did not wince. Perhaps it was the lack of wincing that put a small smirk on the side of Nie Mingjue’s mouth. “I’ll go change. Here, you can help Zewu-jun.” </p>
<p>“I…” Meng Yao blanked. “Pardon?” </p>
<p>“There’s something caught beneath one of his scales,” Meng Yao mentally adjusted the pronouns he’d assigned the dragons. ‘It’ likely wasn’t flattering anyway. “I haven’t been able to find it.” </p>
<p>Zewu-jun’s head twisted around and rubbed against the ground in what Meng Yao imagined to be either agreement or irritation. </p>
<p>“Aren’t I needed for the negotiations?” Meng Yao asked. </p>
<p>“Obviously. I don’t want to have to deal with them. But we need to feed them first, which gives us time to help Zewu-jun.” He paused and frowned. “Have you eaten?” </p>
<p>“Yes, but—”</p>
<p>“Then here.” He shoved the brush into Meng Yao’s hand. It was unlike any brush Meng Yao had seen before; the bristles might as well have been nails with how long and sharp they were. “You’ll want to lift the scale slightly and slide two or three bristles underneath.”</p>
<p>“And it won’t injure him?”</p>
<p>“Nothing short of diamond can pierce dragonhide.” They needed to stop telling him things of such a confidential nature. Nie Mingjue gestured to a broad expanse of Zewu-jun’s back. “It’s somewhere in this area. Don’t worry, Meng Yao. I won’t commence talks until you’ve arrived.”</p>
<p>As though <em>that</em> were the issue. Before Meng Yao could protest again, Nie Mingjue disappeared back down the path. </p>
<p>“That is the most frustrating man I have ever met.” Zewu-jun huffed, a gust of breath smelling of fresh lakewater. Meng Yao bowed. “This one apologizes most sincerely, Zew-jun. I spoke out of turn.” </p>
<p>Zewu-jun shifted again, reminding Meng Yao of the task at hand. He bit back yet another apology and carefully examined the area in question. When he looked closer he could see small crystalline formations embedded all along thumbnail-sized scales, all tightly knit together. He almost doubted he could lift them at all, until he pressed a hand against Zewu-jun’s side. Pins and needles ran up his arm, the fine hairs on his forearm lifting of their own accord. Not unpleasant, he noted. He used his fingernail to ease one of the scales up and gently brushed the area beneath. </p>
<p>Zewu-jun rumbled and Meng Yao snapped backwards. “I’m sorry.” </p>
<p>Zewu-jun tilted his head and regarded him with a surprisingly gentle eye. Breathing through the uncertainty, Meng Yao continued, laboriously checking each scale and brushing underneath the area to clear out any debris. He shifted his gaze between the scales and Zewu-jun’s face, and allowed himself a small, private smile of satisfaction when he noticed the dragon’s eyes half-closed in apparent bliss. </p>
<p>Wei Wuxian proved right once again: they did speak, in their own way. </p>
<p>He finally found the offender, a thumb-sized pebble, trapped near the shoulder joint of Zew-jun’s left leg. Meng Yao daringly tucked it away in his sleeve as a keepsake. </p>
<p>Zewu-jun stood and turned about, regarding Meng Yao with what he could only imagine to be gratitude. It was a humbling thing. The dragon lowered his head and pressed it against Meng Yao’s chest. He stumbled a bit before catching himself, and laid his palm against the crest between Zewu-jun’s eyes. He’d gotten used to the tingling sensation while working, but it returned full force. The rumble returned as well. </p>
<p>Meng Yao bowed. “This one was honoured to be of assistance, Zewu-jun.” </p>
<p>Zewu-jun took off into the air, leaving behind a gentle breeze Meng Yao breathed in for only a moment before turning to head back to his room. He changed quickly and then pulled out his writing utensils to start a missive to his father. </p>
<p>More than two dragons. He hadn’t imagined there were more than two in the entire world, and yet in the Unclean Realm he’d already encountered three. More? Had the dragon he’d seen the night Jingyi arrived been another specimen entirely? </p>
<p>Obviously his father needed to know. Three—or more—dragons put them in a position where they didn’t even need those ridden by the Two Lords. Zewu-jun and Chifeng-zun could remain in the Unclean Realm, outside of his father’s influence, and they could find other ways… </p>
<p>But if there were only the three, it meant Hanguang-jun would be the one to fall into his father’s thrall. </p>
<p>His hand uncharacteristically shook as he imparted the news. Once he completed the letter, he stared at it a moment. </p>
<p>Perhaps he needed to err on the side of caution, and gather more information first. After all, his father relied on him for this. He took the letter and crumpled it in his hand. </p>
<p>On his way to the reception hall, he tossed it into one of the standing braziers lining the hallways. </p>
<p>Nie Mingjue and Lan Xichen, both present and dressed appropriately to their station as the Two Lords of Jade and Blades, remained true to Nie Mingjue’s word. They waited for him to arrive before commencing the discussion.</p><hr/>
<p>The Zhu, as it turned out, were not the cut-throated master negotiators Meng Yao feared. They had, in fact, arrived early due to favourable weather, and brought with them generous gifts for their hosts. Gifts, as it turned out, which included a number of jars of liquor which smelled of over-ripened fruit, yet tasted sweet and nutty and perfectly lovely. </p>
<p>At the celebration that evening to cheer their mutually satisfactory agreement, the Zhu were free with their pours—apparently they valued quick wits and had nothing but compliments for Meng Yao for having outmaneuvered them on more than one point. He had barely finished one cup when another was shoved into his hand, and cheers went up every time he drank. Surrounded by well-meaning men and women, Meng Yao found it hard to refuse, and his belly and cheeks both grew excessively warm. </p>
<p>Eventually, when the last of the Zhu admitted defeat and allowed Meng Yao to escort her to her room, he stumbled back down the corridor towards his own bedroom. The rest of the household had long seen themselves to bed, leaving him to make his way back to his room alone, a precarious wobble in each step. He crossed out into the courtyard separating the guest quarters from the family spaces, and paused when he heard a friendly ‘Yao-ge!’ from somewhere nearby. He twisted around, confused and nearly stumbling over his robes, until he looked up and saw Wei Wuxian happily seated on a nearby roof. </p>
<p>“Is that comfortable?” </p>
<p>“Come up and find out,” Wei Wuxian called. </p>
<p>Meng Yao held a hand to his lips to shush him. “You’ll wake the household.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Wei Wuxian grinned and jumped down. He had another jar of liquor in his hand, and waggled it Meng Yao’s way. </p>
<p>“Your constitution is stronger than mine, Wuxian,” Meng Yao told him. He was proud of how his words absolutely did not slur. “I shouldn’t.”</p>
<p>“Hmm.” Wei Wuxian rubbed his nose thoughtfully, then grinned. “Shouldn’t isn’t ‘cannot.’” </p>
<p>Well, no point arguing with that flawless bit of logic. </p>
<p>Somehow, Wei Wuxian managed to maneuver them both up to the roof without cracking anyone’s head open. He helped Meng Yao settle on a surprisingly comfortable spot and passed him the open jar for a long sip. It was even better now, under the open autumn sky, next to Wei Wuxian than it had been in the reception hall surrounded by congratulatory gladhanding. </p>
<p>“You know,” Wei Wuxian said in a voice full of speculation, “I was certain that you’d taken us for a ride during shijie’s wedding negotiations, but you went easy on us, didn’t you?” </p>
<p>Meng Yao took another long sip and laughed. “Jin Guangshan was furious with me.” Wei Wuxian took a drink, spilling liquor down his chin. </p>
<p>“Is that why he let you go so easy?” </p>
<p>Meng Yao scoffed. “I am only a chicken, Young Master Wei.” </p>
<p>“Hey, hey, hey, what happened to ‘Wuxian?’ I worked hard for that.”</p>
<p>“You cannot annoy people into intimacy.” </p>
<p>“That’s what Lan Zhan thought. He was wrong, too.” Meng Yao held out his hand for the liquor and Wei Wuxian gamely passed it over. “What do you mean, you’re a chicken?” </p>
<p>“In terms of the contract, I am a thing of non-importance. An afterthought. Something you see on your way out the door and point to and say ‘that, there. I want that too’ out of spite. Such as a chicken.” </p>
<p>Wei Wuxian frowned, though in his state of inebriation it looked more like a pout. Then again, Meng Yao wasn’t one to throw stones; he was feeling swimming warmth in his belly and a lovely relaxation to his tongue. “That’s not really what you think, is it?” </p>
<p>Another drink, though this one stuck in his throat with a pleasant burn. “It’s in the contract. You signed it.” </p>
<p>“It didn’t say anything about you being a chicken.” </p>
<p>“I am contractually bound to be a chicken, Wei Wuxian. Do not take this from me. I have never been anything this official before.”</p>
<p>The jar, when passed back to him, had only a small sip left at the very bottom and Meng Yao had to shake it free. How disappointing. </p>
<p>“Do you like it here, Yao-ge?” </p>
<p>“I do. An unfortunate amount.” The thought of the burnt letter sitting in ashes in the brazier certainly had helped along the smooth slide of liquor down his throat, and now the jar was empty he was left with nothing else to occupy his mind save the exceptionally irritating man sitting beside him. </p>
<p>“Why unfortunate? The Unclean Realm cannot possibly be worse than Koi Tower. And the family is here.” </p>
<p>Once again, he wondered how they all managed to take such a liberal view of the word. Sworn brothership and marriage ties aside, there existed a real quality of relationship between the members of the Household of the Two Lords; one that did not arise merely from official bonds. Sworn brothers could hate each other as easily as blood brothers, afterall. </p>
<p>His eyes drifted shut as Wei Wuxian began extolling the virtues of his would-be home, only snapping awake when his arm shifted and he realized that he really was rather higher off the ground than he usually liked. </p>
<p>“Wuxian, I want to get down now.” Before he fell asleep and rolled over to his untimely end. </p>
<p>“Yeah, Lan Zhan probably isn’t going to be very happy with me. He’d be up here too if he didn’t have to put the boys to bed.” </p>
<p>“Hmm. I wouldn’t have wanted to intrude on a romantic moment.” Not without purpose, anyway. </p>
<p>“Yao-ge, you are so drunk that you wouldn’t have noticed me if I hadn’t called your name.” </p>
<p>Well. That was certainly true. </p>
<p>His foot slipped on the way down, but fortunately he was only a few feet from the ground. He landed on a patch of comfortably soft grass instead of the rock garden lining the sides of the building, for which he was grateful, and rolled over laughing as Wei Wuxian squawked and scrambled down to make sure he hadn’t broken any limbs. To their joint relief, everything seemed to be in working order. </p>
<p>Wei Wuxian helped him up and made sure he was capable of balancing on his own feet—had he been this drunk when he’d scaled the side of the building? It suddenly looked very high—and then tucked himself up against Meng Yao’s side to help him navigate his way back towards his room. </p>
<p>It was sheer confounded luck they ran into Nie Mingjue on the way back. </p>
<p>“Da-ge!” Wei Wuxian called, far too loudly considering the hour. “You’ll help Yao-ge back to his room, yes? It’s so far from mine.”</p>
<p>Nie Mingjue looked back and forth between them. “Should I help you back first?”</p>
<p>“Da-ge, I am hurt by the insinuation I cannot find my own way back to my own room on my own.”</p>
<p>“Wuxian—”</p>
<p>The other man waved a hand and took off down the hall, far steadier than Meng Yao believed was fair, considering how much they’d had to drink. Without Wei Wuxian present to assist, he began listing sideways until Nie Mingjue caught the edge of his robe and pulled him upright. </p>
<p>“This humble chicken apologizes,” he said, fighting to keep his eyes open. </p>
<p>“Chicken?” Nie Mingjue repeated. </p>
<p>Meng Yao stepped forward, and Nie Mingjue gamely stepped up to his side, a silent support beside him as they trod familiar steps through the family quarters. Three months later and it never stopped surprising him to be allowed to live here. </p>
<p>“I’m sorry for this,” he said after a moment’s thought. “You don’t… you probably don’t like it, do you?” </p>
<p>“I share close quarters with my brother and Wei Wuxian. If I really minded escorting drunk men to bed I’d have A-Huan do the rounds at night.” A-Huan. It was so nice they had each other. So nice, their love. It made Meng Yao feel like scum. </p>
<p>“Drunk chickens,” he corrected instead. </p>
<p>“You’re going to need to explain the chicken thing to me.” </p>
<p>They reached his room and Nie Mingjue escorted him inside to put him to bed. It was nice. Meng Yao hadn’t been put to bed since his dubiously unorthodox childhood. He kept it simple: took off the outer robes, removed his simple hairpiece and took off his boots, then tucked him under the covers. </p>
<p>“Mmm. Thank you Da-ge,” Meng Yao whispered before letting his eyes finally close for good. </p>
<p>He heard a very gruff, “You’re welcome, A-Yao,” before succumbing to sleep.</p><hr/>
<p>Two days after the Zhu departed, a letter arrived for Jin Zixuan announcing his father’s imminent arrival. Mang Yao found himself woefully underprepared for the news, and had to plaster the most neutral of smiles on his face as Jin Zixuan turned concerned eyes his way. </p>
<p>Undaunted, his half-brother continued reading the letter, “He sends his best wishes to his son’s honourable hosts, and hopes they will not deny him the chance of seeing his son in person for a short while before the winter comes and makes travel inconvenient. He has matters to discuss both with his son and,” he stumbled, and his eyes flickered upwards towards Meng Yao, “former page.” No surprises there, though he grit his teeth at being dismissed as a mere page considering all the work he’d shouldered in Lanling. “And looks forward to a warm greeting.” </p>
<p>“Like fuck,” Wei Wuxian snapped. </p>
<p>“Wuxian,” Lan Xichen said, though his tone was not nearly as chiding as it probably should have been. </p>
<p>“No, I agree,” Jiang Wanyin said. </p>
<p>“He is my father,” Jin Zixuan murmured, a regretful cast to his face. Jiang Yanli placed her hand atop his. “At least it implies a short visit.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao turned studious attention to his meal, ignoring the weight of the attention placed upon him. He had little doubt as to <em>why</em> the sudden interest in visiting had arisen, and he doubted it had anything to do with missing his son. Meng Yao’s specific inclusion in the letter was doubtless meant to be a warning; he had until his father’s arrival to produce quality information about the dragons, or there would be consequences. </p>
<p>At least there were fewer stairs in the Unclean Realm. </p>
<p>Distraction hounded him during his lessons with the boys and into his afternoon with Lan Xichen and Nie Mingjue. Once or twice, he could tell they were on the verge of saying something, but he rededicated himself to the task before him—both guqin and accounts payable—and after a moment the urge seemed to leave them. </p>
<p>That evening, he sought out the solitude offered by the landing, looking out over the cliff into the distant peaks. His thoughts took on a traitorous tone. </p>
<p><em>Stay away,</em> he thought very hard at Zewu-jun, Chifeng-zun and Hanguang-jun. <em>I know I must betray you, but give me more time.</em> The very request was selfish perfidy, knowing the inevitability of what he had to do. Asking anything of them felt loathsome, and while Meng Yao long understood himself to be a contemptible man, he’d thought there to be limits to what he was willing to do to accomplish his goals. Obviously not. His nature was too set, carved in stone and unbending no matter the price.</p>
<p>He breathed in the mountain air and reminded himself of what all this was for. </p>
<p>He skipped the family meal that evening, ostensibly to ensure the servants were properly prepared for the arrival of Jin Guangshan and his retinue. Unlike those at Koi Tower, who only reluctantly listened to his directives when he proved the efficiency of them, those in the Unclean Realm seemed happy for the input. He provided strict orders as to who could personally attend his father, making it a matter of seniority—all the senior members of the staff in the Unclean Realm happened to be men, save for a few of the aunties working in the kitchen, for which he was prestigiously grateful—and preferences for meals. He could have been quicker about the self-imposed tasks, but he wasn’t sure he could stand the overbearing silent concern everyone projected his way. </p>
<p>It proved fruitless, of course. Both Lan Xichen and Nie Mingjue caught up with him shortly before he made his way back to his room. Lan Xichen carried a tray laden with food, and Nie Mingjue the weight of the world, judging from the set of his shoulders. </p>
<p>He’d been prepared to put his mask away for the day, and felt it straining around his eyes. “Thank you.” He bit any number of other responses back, though he wasn’t sure how successful he was in covering them up entirely. “Everything is prepared for the arrival of our distinguished guest.” </p>
<p>“Meng Yao—” Nie Mingjue began. He froze in the act of opening his door, preparing himself. For what, he had no idea, but his entire body braced as though readying for a physical blow. “You…”</p>
<p>Lan Xichen picked up his husband’s aborted words. “You don’t need to see him. We can find something for you to do. In Gusu, perhaps. You’ve told us you want to see the library. You could leave early in the morning, before he arrives.”</p>
<p>Ah. Not a physical blow, then. Just an emotional one. “Sect Leader Jin has specifically mentioned a desire for my presence. I’m sure he has important matters to discuss with me.” He bit down on his tongue and swallowed back the shaking of his jaw. “Only.” They waited patiently for him to continue and he forced another smile. “I believe that Sect Leader Jin’s constitution is not what it once was, and the sight of anything out of the ordinary might overwhelm him. Perhaps another occupation could be found for the dragons while he is here?” </p>
<p>He didn’t look up to see how the words were received, but the damning silence which followed told him all he needed to know. </p>
<p>“Of course,” Lan Xichen finally agreed, voice strained. </p>
<p>Meng Yao nodded and accepted the plate of food, though the nausea roiling in his stomach suggested it would go to waste. “Good night, Lan Xichen, Nie Mingjue.” </p>
<p>He waited exactly as long as proper for them to return the sentiment before closing the door behind him.</p><hr/>
<p>Early the next morning—earlier than should have been believable, unless his father force-marched his people through the night, which he supposed answered the question itself—Jin Guangshan and his retinue of a dozen cultivators arrived. Nie Mingjue and Lan Xichen met him outside the gates, and did not repeat the formal words Meng Yao remembered from his own arrival. They bowed, and offered every evidence of civility, but there was no request to acknowledge the duties and expectations requested or offered. He’d thought it a tradition of the Unclean Realm to which even the Zhu had been treated, but had no time to ruminate on the difference before his father was stepping forward out of his all-too-shallow bow. </p>
<p>“Sect Leader Nie, Sect Leader Lan, how good to see you. I’m sure you’ve been nothing but considerate hosts to my son and heir.” </p>
<p>“Sect Heir Jin has been an exemplary guest. We of course look forward to hosting yourself, knowing it will be more of the same,” Lan Xichen offered in return. “May we show you to your rooms, and allow you to take a moment to recover from your travels.” </p>
<p>“Ah, no need to stand on ceremony, we’ll all be family soon enough,” Jin Guanshan chuckled. “I’m sure Zixuan can do me the favour of escorting me wherever I need to go.”</p>
<p>Meng Yao had never been so thankful to be completely ignored. Not a single look passed his way as Jin Zixuan escorted their father through the gates, and he managed a few quick moments to breathe before turning to attend Nie Mingjue and Lan Xichen as they made their way back to the reception hall. There would be a banquet tonight—simple, elegantly arranged with dishes both favoured in Qinghe and Lanling, though with no shortage of items which Lan Wangji and Lan Xichen would find appealing—but for all intents and purposes, Jin Guangshan was Jin Zixuan’s guest, and everyone else could hopefully go about the next few days in peace. </p>
<p>The hope lasted less than an hour, when one of the servants nervously approached and told him that Jin Guangshan had requested his presence. “Also,” the man said nervously, “He requested a more delicate touch from the servants assigned to his needs.”</p>
<p>“I’ll speak with him. Please maintain the current arrangements for now.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao’s face ached with the force of keeping his smile in place as he made his way to the guest rooms his father had been assigned. </p>
<p><em>Smile,</em> his mother once told him. <em>Smile throughout all of it. Every moment you want to scream or cry, just smile. It won’t make you feel better. It won’t help you at all. But it will make them think you are weak and happy to receive whatever they wish to dole out, and from that moment on they will underestimate you.</em></p>
<p>These words in mind, he knocked on his father’s door and allowed himself inside. </p>
<p>“Sect Leader Jin,” he greeted, bowing. “This unworthy one is happy to see you well and hale.” </p>
<p>His father waited an awkwardly long time before turning from the window looking out upon a craggy mountainside before replying, his voice strapped of the good cheer he’d presented to Lan Xichen and Nie Mingjue. “I am <em>not</em> well or hale, Meng Yao,” his father stated. Meng Yao cast a furtive look about the room, but it seemed they were on their own. “Do you know why that might be?” </p>
<p>“I… can only imagine it is because of some trespass of mine.” </p>
<p>“Oh, you imagine it to be so? I would think that a whore’s bastard aspiring to be considered my son would know when he has trespassed upon my very limited patience.” </p>
<p><em>Oh, you imagine it to be so?</em> had been the words Jin Guangshan had spoken immediately before grabbing Meng Yao by the throat and throwing him down the steps of Koi Tower. Meng Yao hid shaking hands within his sleeves. </p>
<p><em>Smile, smile, smile.</em> “I’m sorry I have not succeeded in delivering the information you want, Sect Leader Jin. Secrets in the Unclean Realm are preciously guarded, and it wasn’t until I had been here more than a month before I even saw a dragon with my own eyes.” His heart beat simultaneously in both his stomach and throat, having fled his chest in fear of the tone in his father’s voice. </p>
<p>“Did I fail to make myself clear when I sent you here?” Ah, of course, as he had been the one to request Meng Yao’s presence. Wei Wuxian had nothing at all to do with it. “If you ever want to aspire to be more than a blight on my legacy then you will do as you’re told.” </p>
<p>The blow came from nowhere, and caught Meng Yao across the shoulder blades, his father’s ostentatiously heavy golden belt biting through his robes and into his skin. A half-shout escaped Meng Yao’s lips before he clamped them shut, and he held himself still through the next, and the next. Four all together—one for each month he’d failed to deliver his father up the dragons, and each strike imbued with spiritual energy to make sure he felt them a hundred times worse than his father’s otherwise weak arm would allow for. </p>
<p>Considering how he meant to betray the Household of the Two Lords, he took it as his due. </p>
<p>When he was certain his father had finished, Meng Yao straightened. His robes burned against his skin, but the pain paled in comparison to the damage his father had done to him in the past. </p>
<p>“Meng Yao,” Jin Guangshan said with the same oily smile he’d offered Nie Mingjue and Lan Xichen upon arrival. “I would <em>never</em> think to strike my own son, no matter the colour of his eyes.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao, still smiling, nodded in understanding. “Is there anything you need at the moment?” </p>
<p>“No. Zixuan has gone to retrieve Lady Jiang for us to have a family chat. You’re unnecessary.”</p>
<p>He bowed and showed himself out. </p>
<p>Despite the encroaching autumnal cold, it was still warm out and his robes relatively light. They’d done nothing at all to protect his back from the blows, and every step pulled at the injured area until he wanted to fall over. Four blows should have been nothing. Would have been, if his father hadn’t wanted him half-crippled in the name of his failure.</p>
<p>The boys were expecting him, but he had just enough time for a very brief detour to the healer’s, though not to use the salve he furtively collected.</p><hr/>
<p>Dinner that evening proved nearly insufferable in the pall Jin Guangshan’s presence cast on the usually cheerful proceedings. He considered requesting his meal in his room, but decided he needed to be there. If Jin Guangshan thought him to be deliberately missing opportunities to ingratiate himself to the House, there’d be more than four lashes across his back. Unlike the robes he’d acquired during his stay in the Unclean Realm, all subtly embroidered with the heraldry of the Two Lords and conspicuously left in his rooms at random points until they mostly replaced his usual wardrobe, he dressed yet again in the simple attire he’d brought with him. He met Jiang Wanyin outside the reception hall, who frowned at the sight but thankfully declined to speak. </p>
<p>Inside, the tables were all rearranged to suit a more formal setting, though Nie Mingjue and Lan Xichen remained in place as was their due. He kept his eyes averted, slipping into a seat behind Jin Zixuan and Jiang Yanli. Across from them, the Jin cultivators looked on with varying levels of distaste. At least Jin Zixun had been left in Koi Tower; Meng Yao didn’t want to imagine how he’d behave himself even in such dignified company. </p>
<p>“Ah, the Two Lords are too good,” Jin Guangshan laughed boisterously from his seat. “Of course, of course you’re both such attentive hosts as to invite former servants from my household to join us at mealtimes, but I assure you it’s unnecessary.” </p>
<p>As the most prominent members of the household, Jin Zixuan, Jiang Wanyin, Nie Huaisang and Lan Wangji had the dubious honour of sitting in the first row. If he imagined them a wall, he could suffer through a single meal alongside Jiang Yanli and Wei Wuxian. Now that Jin Guangshan had made his sentiments regarding Meng Yao’s presence clear, he could likely get away with missing the shared meals until their guests left the Unclean Realm. </p>
<p>“You’re mistaken, Sect Leader Jin,” Nie Mingjue stated. Baxia trembled beside him. Meng Yao focused his attention on the table before him. “The only ones here besides yourself and your cultivators are honourable members of our Household.” </p>
<p>Another laugh, this one considerably stilted though no more fake. “I suppose the Two Lords organize their house and family much differently than the rest of us, considering the very distinguished collection of persons they’ve brought under their protection.” He grabbed his cup. “Allow me to drink to the health of the Household of the Two Lords, as well as those who are here merely at their forbearance.” </p>
<p>Wei Wuxian, just to Meng Yao’s left, started to reply. Meng Yao snapped a hand out to catch his arm, and while he did not look towards him, hoped that drinking from his own cup got the point across as succinctly as possible. </p>
<p>Still, everyone drank, which was the best Meng Yao could hope for. </p>
<p>Unlike Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian, who had a brilliant built in excuse of two young children needing their attention and escaped early on, the rest of them were expected to be in the banquet hall late into the night. Jin Guangshan pronounced the meal as ‘an excellent attempt to recreate his favourite dishes’ and his cultivators drank a reasonable amount; nothing to excess, unlike they might have done at Koi Tower, getting too deep into their cups while following the example of their Sect Leader and a certain absent cousin. Perhaps it was the presence of the Two Lords themselves that forced them to temperance.</p>
<p>Meng Yao waited exactly five minutes longer than manners demanded before excusing himself for the evening. His back was on fire after a day full of his usual routine, and he had salve waiting for him in his room he desperately needed to apply. </p>
<p>“Ah, now that it’s only respectable company we can discuss some particulars I’ve been meaning to address…” Followed him out the door. </p>
<p>Let them discuss whatever they wished. Meng Yao took vicious pleasure in noting that no matter what came up, Nie Mingjue would consult him on everything before putting any decisions into effect. He’d proven himself enough to merit such considerations. </p>
<p>He’d finally tucked himself away in his rooms, salve in hand and robes half-undone, when a knock sounded at his door. Beyond irritated, Meng Yao nonetheless answered, ready with a polite dismissal for whoever needed his help so late into the evening and frantically praying it wasn’t his father come to call. </p>
<p>Nie Huaisang swept in without waiting for an invitation. “Well, let’s see then.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao frowned. “Young Master Nie?”</p>
<p>Nie Huaisang snapped his fan shut. “Whatever he’s done to you to send you scurrying off to the healers.”</p>
<p>No point denying it, but hopefully he could scare Nie Huaisang off with formality; as a whole, the family seemed to be allergic to it. “It’s not proper for you to be here, Young Master Nie.”</p>
<p>“Will you stop? I think you’re forgetting you’re in the Unclean Realm instead of Koi Tower. Show me, or I tell Da-ge and then we have to deal with whatever political fallout comes out of him breaking the bastard’s nose.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao winced. “If we might find another insult, it would be appreciated.”</p>
<p>Nie Huaisang’s face fell into something altogether more sombre, an expression which should have been alien on the other man’s face but fit him surprisingly well. “Of course. Yao-ge, please. Let me help.”</p>
<p>If the choice came to Nie Huaisang or his elder brother, at least the former could keep his temper. Meng Yao reluctantly allowed his robes down to expose his back. Nie Huaisang hissed through his teeth. </p>
<p>“What did he want?” </p>
<p>“What he always wants. To remind me of my place.” He trembled at the first touch of salve-coated fingers to his back. “It’s nothing he hasn’t done before.” </p>
<p>“I’ve never been beaten a day in my life.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao cast a droll look over his shoulder. “That much is obvious.” </p>
<p>“Vicious, Yao-ge,” Nie Huaisang barked out with a surprised laugh. Still, his touch remained gentle and the salve worked quickly, easing away the hurt and making his movements significantly easier. When he finished, Meng Yao pulled his under robe back into place. When he turned, Nie Huaisang had a speculative look on his face. “I know what I said, but you absolutely cannot mention this to Da-ge. He values you so much this would drive him to rage.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao swallowed back the bitter taste the sentiment left in his mouth. “I value him too, Nie Huaisang.” Just not enough to keep faith with him and Lan Xichen over his father. </p>
<p>“Once the wedding is over, you will never have to see him again. I give you my word as Sect Heir.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao inclined his head. “Very kind.” </p>
<p>Obviously dissatisfied with the response, but at otherwise loose ends, Nie Huaisang opened his fan again. “Be kind to yourself, Meng Yao. I hear from Da-ge that Jin Guangshan plans to leave the day after tomorrow. If he’s done torturing you, I can make sure you’re busy until then.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao took a breath and nodded. “Yes, please.” He reluctantly met Nie Huaisang’s eyes. “Thank you.” </p>
<p>Nie Huaisang nodded behind his fan and left Meng Yao to his own devices. </p>
<p>He slept on his stomach the next two nights, but by the time his father was ready to leave the wounds were mostly healed thanks to the salve. Nie Huaisang showed up several more times to help him apply it, in and out quick enough to avoid observation. </p>
<p>Still, on the last day, Meng Yao could not avoid the last summons from his father. </p>
<p>The skin on his back pulled uncomfortably under his robes, though it was fortunately much improved from the original injury. From the dissatisfied glance Jin Guangshan leveled his way when Meng Yao arrived to escort him to the gates with more speed than intended, he had expected the pain to last significantly longer. </p>
<p>“It does seem you’ve managed to carve out a place for yourself here,” he said as they made their way along the paths towards the main gate where the members of the household waited to bid their farewells. “You’re in an excellent position, if you’d actually manage to do something with it.” </p>
<p>“I will mark your words during the coming winter,” Meng Yao assured him. </p>
<p>Jin Guangshan paused in step, and Meng Yao fell still beside him. “I know your mother must have taught you some of her arts.” Meng Yao’s fist clenched at his side. “Do whatever you must to ensure I get my due.” </p>
<p>“I think you underestimate the power of the Two Lords and their devotion to one another.” </p>
<p>“Well, whatever you think is best.” He paused and placed a hand on Meng Yao’s shoulders, one of his fingers straying down to press against the topmost stripe of bruising on his back. “I am counting on you.” </p>
<p>Breadcrumbs of affection thus scattered for the picking, he continued on his way. Meng Yao followed in his wake, eventually falling into place next to Wei Wuxian to bid the official farewell. </p>
<p>Once the Jin retinue went on its way, Wei Wuxian slumped beside him. “Can we avoid any more guests until the springtime? That was exhausting.”</p>
<p>“You spent most of your time drunk on rooftops and avoiding conversations,” Jiang Wanyin reminded him. “What do you have to complain about?” </p>
<p>“A-Cheng, I think what you meant to say was ‘thank you, Wei Wuxian, for spending all your time on rooftops and preventing the ruination of shijie’s wedding by avoiding conversations during which you would surely end up punching our honourable visitor or his honourable attendees.’”</p>
<p>“That does sound more accurate,” Nie Huaisang agreed. “Unfortunately, we still have Sect Leader Yao’s visit to look forward to next month.”</p>
<p>They filtered back through the gates, though Jin Zixuan hung back to fall into step with Meng Yao, allowing Jiang Yanli to catch up to her brothers. </p>
<p>“I haven’t seen you much in the past few days,” he said. “Can I tempt you to a game of weiqi now he’s gone?” </p>
<p>Meng Yao sniffed, though a real smile stole across his face. “You’re terrible at weiqi.” </p>
<p>“Admittedly. I thought you might enjoy not having to actively think about anything for a while.” </p>
<p>Despite himself, Meng Yao smiled. “Well, if you insist. I suppose some humility would be good for you.”</p>
<p>Pained, Jin Zixuan replied, “Between you and A-Li’s brothers, I would say you all have that adequately covered.”</p><hr/>
<p>Autumn quickly trailed towards winter, the colourful finery of the great forests surrounding the Unclean Realm drifting to the ground and settling in preparation of the coming snows. Everyone warned Meng Yao about the brutal Qinghe winters, though he still wasn’t sure what to expect. </p>
<p>He quickly came to understand. Autumn in Lanling lasted for months, awash with bright colours and cool winds. In Qinghe, it barely seemed to last a week before snow descended with the bone-chilling and unassailable cold, burying the entirety of the Unclean Realm under deep drifts and icy winds. </p>
<p>Jin Zixuan showed up at his door the morning after the first major snowfall, a sizable bundle of clothing in his arms. The blizzard still raged outside, howling winds throwing sharp snowflakes at the windows.</p>
<p>“A-Li and I wanted to make sure you were prepared,” his brother offered, shoving them unceremoniously towards Meng Yao. The bundle proved to be well-tailored robes made of thicker material than Meng Yao’s current wardrobe, and carefully lined with extra cloth. Meng Yao noted, with some interest, they were also styled in the way of the Two Lords, with dark embroidered clouds and dragon scales. He admitted himself to be touched every time they thought to gift him such attire, as though trying to call him family. </p>
<p>He wore them to lessons with the boys that morning, both of them also bedecked in warmer robes, similarly patterned. It made his chest ache, though not for want of gold fabric, as he might have suspected when he’d first come to stay. </p>
<p>They started with history, and A-Yuan immediately began fidgeting. Meng Yao first attributed it to the stiffness of the new robes. And then, when he began itching the skin of his forearms almost to the point of blood, he decided they must have been quite itchy—he had half a mind to send to the healer for something to ease the discomfort if the boy didn’t soon settle. A-Yuan usually sat much better than Jingyi and paid close attention to his lessons, but his unrest carried through for most of the lesson and well into the late morning. </p>
<p>A-Yuan jumped to his feet in the middle of one of Meng Yao’s sentences, a wild look in his eyes, dancing back and forth with so much nervous energy Meng Yao worried he’d rip up the matting beneath his feet.</p>
<p>“A-Yuan? Are you—”</p>
<p>Before Meng Yao could finish, A-Yuan heaved a great sneeze. Reality seemed to twist around them, and a piercing feeling of vertigo stabbed at Meng Yao through his inner ear. His face twisted in pain, eyes snapping shut against it. The feeling left him again within seconds, and when he opened his eyes.</p>
<p>Oh. </p>
<p>A number of things slid into place, replacing reality as Meng Yao understood it, as A-Yuan turned into a dragon.</p>
<p>
  <em>A-Yuan turned into a dragon.</em>
</p>
<p>Where A-Yuan had stood, a petite dragon remained in place. Lessons promptly forgotten, Jingyi crowed in excitement and tackled the dragon—tackled A-Yuan?—wrapping his arms around a shorter neck than Meng Yao had seen before and avoiding the delicately feathered wings protruding from his sides. None of the other dragons had wings. And also unlike those Meng Yao had seen, gold scales covered A-Yuan’s body save for the burnished copper mane. </p>
<p>Jingyi’s enthusiastic embrace knocked them into the sunlight cast by the nearby window. The dragon was still shorter than Meng Yao and seemed as surprised as he did, whipping his head around to look at himself.</p>
<p>How many others? </p>
<p>All this time he’d suspected more dragons than the ones he’d encountered to be ensconced within the Unclean Realm and surrounding territory, but this went beyond the pale. His mind scrolled through countless possibilities before coming to an abrupt halt when A-Yuan’s tail brushed against his hand. The familiar pinprick sensation proved to be exactly what he needed.</p>
<p>“Jingyi,” Meng Yao said with calm he certainly did not feel. “Please make sure you and A-Yuan don’t leave this room.”</p>
<p>“Yes, teacher,” Jingyi said absently, even as A-Yuan flailed and knocked over the table, spilling ink, paper and brushes across the floor. </p>
<p>Meng Yao stood and exited the room to place a rudimentary locking talisman upon the door. It wouldn’t keep out anyone truly determined to get inside—Meng Yao’s weak cultivation failing him yet again—but hopefully it would deter any curious eyes for long enough for Meng Yao to go in search of help. </p>
<p>After a brief panic attack.</p>
<p>He allowed himself exactly ninety seconds of hyperventilation before a crash from within the room pulled him back to himself. For good measure he added a silencing charm, abruptly cutting out the sounds of Jingyi’s delighted laughter, and took off. </p>
<p>This, of course, had to occur on the day when Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji were unavailable. The latter had dropped the boys off that morning with a polite nod and a request for Meng Yao to watch them throughout the period in which they all usually enjoyed their guqin lessons. Some sort of disturbance in the higher peaks had been brought to the attention of Lan Xichen and Nie Mingjue, and he and Wei Wuxian had been tasked with its investigation. </p>
<p>In the absence of A-Yuan’s parents, Meng Yao sought out the next most viable option. </p>
<p>The Two Lords tucked themselves away early in the morning with a delegation from the Yao sect, looking to fight against Meng Yao’s recommended adjustments to their trading agreements, and interrupting them would prove a necessary evil. He loathed the idea of interrupting anything to do with the business of the Two Lords, but Lan Xichen and Nie Mingjue were the only ones he felt confident in speaking with. Doubtless everyone save him was in on this secret—the enormity of it and the inherent repercussions near-stupefied him in their scope and scale—but he couldn’t take the speculation for granted. </p>
<p>Every eye in the room turned his way when he entered with a low bow. “Pardon this one for intruding, but there is an urgent matter I must ask the Lord of Jade accompany me to address.” </p>
<p>Sect Leader Yao scoffed. “Are we so unimportant that Jin Guangshan’s bastard can interrupt whenever he pleases?” The sting of the words washed through him in deference to other, much more pressing, considerations. The Sect Leader’s attitude towards him was part of why Meng Yao had excused himself from the meetings, after all.</p>
<p>Nie Mingjue, who had been regarding Meng Yao with some confusion, now leveled a hard glare towards Sect Leader Yao. “If a valued member of our Household declares something is urgent, then we choose to believe them. Just because yours pester you with nonsense doesn’t mean ours aren’t competent enough to deal with minor emergencies on their  own.” </p>
<p>Lan Xichen used the ensuing uproar to escape without further remark. </p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” he asked with a creased brow. </p>
<p>Meng Yao opened his mouth to speak and found his words had fled him. In a show of uproarious impropriety, he grabbed Lan Xichen’s wrist and pulled him along through the corridors back to the room in which he’d left the boys. Inappropriate, perhaps. Indecorous, definitely. But needs must. </p>
<p>All too quickly they reached the classroom and Meng Yao banished the locking talisman with a wave of his hand. He felt it pertinent to leave the silencing talisman in place, and slid open the door to reveal A-Yuan hovering a full five feet off the floor, Jingyi holding onto his tail as though flying a particularly elaborate kite. </p>
<p>“Ah.” Lan Xichen stepped inside and, after a moment’s consideration, Meng Yao opted to join him. He slid the door shut behind them. “A-Yuan.” </p>
<p>The boys both froze, and whatever power kept A-Yuan aloft failed, sending him toppling to the ground. He landed on top of Jingyi, a flurry of limbs both skin and scale. Impressively, the boys managed to disentangle themselves again almost immediately and hopped up. </p>
<p>“Zewu-jun!” Jingyi called. “A-Yuan is born true!” </p>
<p>The awful twisting in Meng Yao’s gut solidified into a mass of cold metal, an anxious press against his sternum until he could barely breathe. It battered against every inch of his self-control in a hard ramming motion coming in waves; he would find himself capable of taking a breath only to lose it again in the next moment. He noted Lan Xichen—Zewu-jun, another dragon, of course he was—eyeing him with concern, even as he smiled encouragingly at the boys. </p>
<p>“How many?” Meng Yao finally asked. </p>
<p>Lan Xichen did him the courtesy of not feigning ignorance. “In total, or in our House?” </p>
<p>Answer enough, he supposed. </p>
<p>“I believe this would be your area of expertise, Lord of Jade, if you would pardon me.” Lan Xichen had the unmitigated gall to look hurt that Meng Yao had reverted to his title, when all Meng Yao wanted to do, truly, was scream. His mask was firm. His smile in place. And when he bowed it was the picture perfect example of the deference due to one so much higher in station that he might as well have been crawling with belly on the ground. </p>
<p>“A-Yao.”</p>
<p>He walked out of the room. Through the corridors. At some point, he thought he heard someone calling his name, but what he needed was his room and solitude and <em>a single fucking moment to process the fact he’d been living among who knew how many legendary magical creatures who had obviously known him to be an duplicitous snake in their midst and justifiably decided not to trust him.</em> </p>
<p>The thing of it was, he could acknowledge with the part of his brain still capable of higher thought, this solved a number of problems. His father could have a dragon, just not one of the Household of the Two Lords. Surely if, as Lan Xichen implied, there were others out there then there had to be some self-serving enough to want the privilege and advancement which could come with serving Koi Tower. He could write the missive immediately informing his father that no, taking possession of the dragons ‘belonging to’ the Two Lords (oh, fuck, Nie Mingjue had to be Chifeng-zun) was an untenable solution to his request and he could begin making inquiries further abroad. </p>
<p>But then, it never had truly been about the dragons themselves. Oh, certainly, Jin Guangshan wanted the power and prestige enjoyed by the Two Lords, but he wanted it at the expense of the Two Lords themselves. To be equal to them by taking what was theirs and twisting it to his own advantage. His father loathed the thought of being beneath anyone, no matter how meritorious their claims to power. </p>
<p>Once, in Koi Tower, there had been a merchant who’d come to sup with his father, very early on in the days of Meng Yao’s position. His wife had been very beautiful, and they’d obviously been in love. No matter his father had every woman in Koi Tower at his disposal. No matter he’d married one of the foremost female cultivators of the Yu. No matter he already enjoyed mistresses aplenty. No matter, no matter, no matter. </p>
<p>The dragons were the same. </p>
<p>“A-Yao?” </p>
<p>He turned, realizing he’d left his door ajar, and found Zixuan hovering, eyes full of gentle concern. “You’re upset.” </p>
<p>Brilliant observation, all things considered. No need to hit him over the head with the obvious any longer, now Jiang Yanli helpfully coached him to civility.</p>
<p>“I have a headache,” he lied. </p>
<p>Zixuan frowned. “Did someone say something to you?” </p>
<p>“Not at all,” Meng Yao said. “It’s nothing, truly.” </p>
<p>He did not like the look on Zixuan’s face. Not one bit. He’d oftentimes considered his half-brother an idiot, with an intentional and deliberate lack of charity. Jin Zixuan was not an idiot. He was an arrogant, over-privileged child who happened to luck into the love of one of the foremost empathetic women in the entire world and had been moulded and shifted until he resembled something human. Meng Yao consciously misjudged him because it was <em>safer</em> to believe him an idiot. Once he became something more, he became dangerous and Meng Yao could not slot him into that category in his mind without beginning to make plans to do something about him. </p>
<p>“Xichen-ge finally told you, then,” Zixuan finally decided. </p>
<p>Wonderful. Another person right not to trust him. Then again, he wasn’t even supposed to be here, was he? He was only the fucking chicken. </p>
<p>“It’s a shock, I know.” Now he was trying to be kind. Meng Yao wanted to hang himself from the rafters. “They’re still the people we know, Meng Yao. The people we love.” </p>
<p>“The people we.” Meng Yao’s last vestige of self-control slipped away from him completely and he snapped. “<em>The people we love?!</em> What do I know about love, Jin Zixuan? What could I possibly, possibly know about it at all?” </p>
<p>Zixuan frowned. “I thought—” </p>
<p>The connection between his brain and his mouth severed under the weight of revelation, as though it were a blade cleanly slicing through every defense and self-protective measure he’d ever put in place. </p>
<p>“No. No you didn’t think. Because if you’d had one reasonable thought in your vapid brain, you and Wei Wuxian would have killed me on the way here and told your father it was an unavoidable accident.”</p>
<p>“I’d never—” </p>
<p>“That’s the problem! You’d never. You’d never lower yourself to spying on the people who welcomed you into their home. You’d never kowtow to your father because you’d never have to. You’d never allow yourself to be used as some ridiculous pawn in a power grab because you are the one with the power. You’d never kill someone in cold blood to protect the people who matter to you. </p>
<p>“You know why he sent me here. All of you must know. And you were right not to trust me and you were justified in keeping every secret locked away for fear of him finding out.” Ah, here came the anger, rising up out of the shock as though the untended pot of emotions inside finally boiled over. “At any moment, I could have stumbled upon the secret and betrayed all of you, and you unbelievably naive idiots had the chance to stop it from happening and you couldn’t.” </p>
<p>Zixuan frowned. “I’m sorry, am I to understand that you are angry at me for <em>not</em> murdering you?” </p>
<p>“I am so far beyond angry I can barely see,” Meng Yao stated with admirable calm. His eyes felt wide and wild even to him, but at least he’d stopped shouting. “If I had allowed myself to put the pieces together any sooner, everything here would be compromised. I have spent months memorizing this place and moving about undetected to gather information on his behalf. A single moment of incaution would have been all that was necessary. There would be a letter in his hands describing everything from the layout of the Unclean Realm to the secrets of the Household. Everything I’ve unearthed since arriving would be his to peruse in such pornographic self-congratulation the entirety of Koi Tower would be left blushing. I still, in this very second, find myself composing it in my head. Or stealing out of here undetected and telling him in person.” </p>
<p>“Why?” </p>
<p>Meng Yao staggered at the simplicity of the question.</p>
<p>Zixuan continued, “Why does his approval matter so much? You might have desired legitimization before, but surely this House—”</p>
<p>“<em>Because I want him dead!</em>” </p>
<p>Zixuan staggered back. “What?” </p>
<p>Meng Yao’s entire body shook. “My mother died waiting for him to free her. For him to sweep in and find us and legitimize me and make every day of the years they spent apart mean something. She <em>begged</em> me to go to him. She saved every coin she could for <em>years</em> that I might have enough to travel to Koi Tower and find him. Money she might have used for medicine when she fell ill, and refused to reveal to me when it became obvious she was dying. I helped her when she vomited blood for months on end as her strength failed her, and the sores stole away her beauty and even then when men still wanted her she wouldn’t allow me to send them away because it might yield just a bit more for me to go. </p>
<p>“I wouldn't leave her. I stayed with her two more years through to the very end, and she died in my arms still insisting that I leave.” There had been so much blood. “That my father would take care of me.” His face twisted, and his mouth shook as tears began streaming down his cheeks. His hands clenched, and for a moment he remembered what it felt like when she finally passed, her body slackening in his arms. “And, oh, you <em>saw</em> the way he took care of me. The reason I came to Koi Tower was to get into his good graces to allow me close enough to kill him. I owe him my mother’s life, and I will repay the debt.” Being a servant never afforded him the chance, no matter how diligently he performed or how many duties he assumed. Jin Guangshan was too seasoned a leader to allow for anyone save his family to come close enough to do him harm.</p>
<p>Finally, <em>finally</em> Zixuan had no response.</p>
<p>“So there you have it. I'm not some misguided little wretch blindly desperate for my father's approval. I am a would-be patricide. And,” his breath caught in his chest. “I can’t be here.” Not among the best people he’d ever known, with their wonderful flaws and loving lives. Dragons, probably, the whole lot of them, and he was as tumorous as the illness which had stolen his mother away. He shoved his way past Zixuan, frozen in the middle of the room, and stalked his way blindly towards the closest door. </p>
<p>The air snapped the breath from his lungs as a knife stuck through his chest, yet he barely noticed through the rest of the pain scoring his flesh. This late into the afternoon, the sun already disappeared behind the mountains, casting the entire Unclean Realm in shadow though the sky overhead remained the light grey of the cloud cover, the blizzard finally passed. He pushed his way through the snow, trusting the loose-packed powder to cover his steps if Zixuan cared to look for him. Not that he thought it likely. Their father was an unworthy, power-hungry lech and rapist, but Zixuan was still filial. </p>
<p>Hopefully this time, he would actually understand the incomparable importance of letting someone die to protect his family. </p>
<p>Meng Yao didn’t want to die. Not frozen to death on the side of a mountain some embarrassingly short distance from the Unclean Realm. But his continued life placed everyone in danger. At some point, he’d unconsciously sworn to himself he would protect Lan Xichen and Nie Mingjue and A-Yuan and Jingyi and all the people they loved from his father as best he could, and the discovery did not change anything. This was the only way to guarantee their safety from Meng Yao’s own, terrible nature. </p>
<p>He forced himself forward, further and further away, fuelled by anger and desperate grief until he could barely feel his limbs and then he forced himself further still. Away from the living quarters. Across the frozen stream where he’d first beheld Lan Xichen and Chifeng-zun and into the wilderness beyond. This was not suicide. This was sacrifice. His mother had sacrificed everything for him—her dignity, her beauty, her life—how could he do any less with what he had for those who had truly seen him as a poisonous blight and treated him with kindness and respect anyway? </p>
<p>Fools, all of them. They’d invited their own demise through their front gate and treated it (him) with kindness he never deserved and could never hope to repay. Doing this for them might cede some of the debt. Hopefully the rest could be worked off in his next life. </p>
<p>The sky dimmed quickly to black as the sun set and the clouds remained. </p>
<p>His foot caught a rock beneath the snow and he stumbled. His hands burned as they shot out to catch himself, the snow biting into his skin with the same pain as having shoved them into an inferno. He tried to clench his fingers into fists and found them unwilling to respond. He grit his teeth and attempted to rise anyway, only for his legs to buckle beneath him. </p>
<p>Better to die this way than with a sword through the heart, he supposed. Gentler, if colder. Or perhaps everyone facing death felt this cold beforehand. </p>
<p>He knew the dragon to be above him before it landed, though there was no obvious sound to announce them. </p>
<p>Chifeng-zun landed before him, alighting atop the snow as though merely another flake falling onto the drift. The same reality-piercing shift filled Meng Yao’s perception, and then Nie Mingjue crouched before him.</p>
<p>“You should go,” Meng Yao whispered. </p>
<p>“A-Yao.” Nie Mingjue never called him that. Or did he? A hallucination, perhaps? No, worse: pity. Meng Yao despised pity. It had been such a relief to become an adult and be subjected to contempt instead. “If you really wanted to die, there’s a perfectly good cliff two miles back you could have thrown yourself from.” </p>
<p>“And pollute your lake?” </p>
<p>Nie Mingjue’s forehead furrowed. “I’m going to bring you back, A-Yao.” </p>
<p>“I’ve betrayed all of you.” </p>
<p>“Have you? Because from what I understand, you spilled your guts to your brother at the slightest provocation, and I’m fairly confident from the lack of messages being sent to Koi Tower that you stopped replying to your father’s letters before his visit.” He watched as Nie Mingjue mentally put the pieces together. “It was why he came, wasn’t it?” </p>
<p>Meng Yao frowned at him. “I can’t be trusted, Da-ge.” If he was going to die hearing ‘A-Yao’ on Nie Mingjue’s lips, he’d damn well claim some of the intimacy for his own. </p>
<p>“Not with yourself, obviously.” Another shift, and Chifeng-zun rested before him. Careful claw-tipped feet wrapped around him and lifted him into the air, winging him back to the Unclean Realm. </p>
<p>Darkness claimed him before they got very far.</p><hr/>
<p>As a child, his mother made every effort to keep him well, usually at her own expense, and Meng Yao rarely fell ill. When he did, she showed him the kindness she never showed herself and spent her carefully-hoarded coins on the best medicines to be found from the greatest doctors in Yunping.</p>
<p>“This is the son of Sect Leader Jin,” she told anyone who would listen. No one cared. Her money bought less for more because of her profession, but at least they were willing to sell to her. “He must be treated with the dignity of a proper young master.” </p>
<p>As shudders wracked his body, every nerve ending alight with painful tremors, Meng Yao could hear her voice whispering in his ear, <em>A gentleman does not sweat, A-Yao. He glows with his inner light.</em></p>
<p>He turned his head into the cloth dabbing at his forehead. It felt cool against his skin and he relished the gentle touch until it pulled away from him. Only proper for them to pull away; everyone needed to pull away or they’d get sick as well. Meng Yao bled poison. </p>
<p>Music broke through his fogged up mind, beautiful and sad and soothing. Sometimes the guqin, sometimes the dizi, sometimes the xiao. He preferred the xiao. It spoke to him in ways the others did not, as though the musician composed songs for his ears alone. Whenever he tried to open his eyes sweat spilled into them and he ended up crying at the sting. </p>
<p>“He’ll recover,” he heard once. The feminine voice held no familiarity. “His core is weak, and the fever is strong, but Chifeng-zun reached him in time to prevent anything serious. He’ll even keep all his fingers.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao liked his fingers; his fingers could hold his brush and play the guqin.</p>
<p>Once he woke with a heavy weight pressed down on his chest, warm and electric, the air filled with the scent of petrichor. He saw nubby antlers and golden scales for only a moment before sleeping again. </p>
<p>When he woke, truly woke, Zixuan was sat beside him. The other man eased him upright and helped him drink a cup of lukewarm tea, a strong arm behind his back to support him. Breathing was hard; his lungs struggled with even shallow breaths, and deep ones felt nigh impossible. When he tried more than a shallow inhale, painful coughs wracked his body and left his mouth tasting like metal. </p>
<p>“Please never do this again,” Zixuan said, settling him back to sit up in the bed. Meng Yao frowned, realizing after a long moment’s consideration he’d been set up in a different room. The healer’s, probably, judging from the nearby shelves stocked with carefully organized jars and drawers. </p>
<p>Meng Yao’s throat still hurt too much to talk, and Zixuan held another cup of tea to his lips. Its medicinal taste lingered long after he’d finished. </p>
<p>He took stock. Alive, recovering from the stupidity of his actions—he really needed to remember acting in anger served little to no purpose—and too weak to escape the conversation looming on his horizon. Judging from the look on Zixuan’s face, he’d rather have died on the mountain. </p>
<p>He said as much. </p>
<p>“Don’t joke about that,” Zixuan told him with a hard glower. “Do you understand how ill you were?”</p>
<p>“I’m sure you’re about to tell me,” Meng Yao replied in a hoarse whisper. </p>
<p>“I am. And you are going to sit through to every word I have to say and <em>listen</em> to them.” He took a fortifying breath. “I killed many men during the Sunshot Campaign. And I'm not sure if any of them deserved to die the way our father does. He spent my entire life shaming and dishonouring my mother. And, you know, I'm glad. Because it gave me principles to hold onto. As long as I'm not like him, I must be righteous. And for all those principles, you are right. I am stupid. Stupid enough to believe that shared blood and a little charity makes us brothers instead of everything else that actually matters. I brought you into Koi Tower and essentially abandoned you to the pernicious sycophants that reside there. I regret three things in my life, and that is one of them.” </p>
<p>“What are the other two?” </p>
<p>“<em>The other two are not relevant to this conversation, Meng Yao, I told you to listen.</em>”</p>
<p>Meng Yao managed a weak smile. “You do have a temper.” </p>
<p>“Yes.” He breathed in and continued, “For all that, I can't imagine killing him. Well, I can imagine it, but probably not to the extent you’ve done.”</p>
<p>“Are you going to stop me?” Meng Yao asked, as good a confession of intent. </p>
<p>“Not by force. By finding you a reason not to throw your life away.”</p>
<p>Should he be insulted? “I'm very sneaky. I could get away with it without risking execution.” Or imprisonment, depending on who caught him afterwards. He imagined Lan Xichen would insist on some sort of enforced seclusion as atonement.</p>
<p>“Of that I have no doubt, but what would you do afterwards? You could come back here, of course, but I think after all this time I know you well enough to know that after killing him, all those pretty masks you like to wear would become real. And you would hate everyone here for believing them. Or you would wonder if they did, and look for shadows in every corner, doubting all of us until it drove you to madness. I don't want that for you, A-Yao. So I am going to find a way to make your life here better than what you think you'll have if you kill him.”</p>
<p>Meng Yao stared. And… stared. And stared. “Your plan, in discovering that I intend to murder our father, is to redeem me through <em>affection</em>?” Another coughing fit punctuated his words, and robbed him of the ability to further list the ways his brother’s plan was completely asinine. </p>
<p>Zixuan’s mouth tightened into a thin line. “It worked for me.” Meng Yao’s brow furrowed in confusion and Jin Zixuan sighed, as he always did when preparing himself to say something he really did not want to. “I made an error in judgement during the war. It resulted in A-Li being very badly hurt, and the two of us trapped in a warded cave for a significant amount of time before we were found.”</p>
<p><em>A coward who spent a month of the war hiding ,</em> the cultivators had said. Meng Yao had wondered, especially after spending more time with him. Of all his flaws, cowardice was not among them. </p>
<p>“It ended up being to my advantage, fortunately. Not in how I conducted myself as a warrior, but how I was able to conduct myself as a man.” He reached out and took Meng Yao’s hand, and Meng Yao tried not to tremble in shock. “Everyone here has an invested interest in you.” He winced. “Some more than others.”</p>
<p>Meng Yao needed to return to that later. “It’s certainly a strategy I never considered employing against anyone. May I ask how you decided it to be the best course of action?” </p>
<p>“You’ve been unconscious for a week, A-Yao.” A-Yao again. “I had plenty of time to talk it over with A-Li.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao pondered the words through another cup of tea and soon after found himself drifting towards unconsciousness. Zixuan helped him settle back down into the bed and pulled the covers up. </p>
<p>“Zixuan,” Meng Yao whispered. </p>
<p>“Hmm?” </p>
<p>“I never really thought you were stupid.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t blame you if you had. And you’d certainly have been in good company.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao smiled and almost immediately nodded off.</p><hr/>
<p>There wasn’t someone present the next time he woke up, though an incense burner wafted delicate smelling scents his way, which relaxed the ache in his lungs with each breath. He still struggled to breathe deeply, and coughs wracked his body when he tried, leaving him half-paralyzed and exhausted on the bed. </p>
<p>The sound summoned a new arrival to his room. It was not the healer he knew, and at this point Meng Yao fancied he knew all the household staff in the Unclean Realm. This woman struck him as being much harder to manipulate than the older man who Meng Yao had come to know, which likely meant him to be stuck in bed for quite a bit longer than he’d prefer.</p>
<p>"Lean forward, I want to check your breathing."</p>
<p>He did as he was told; it didn't occur to him until his body had already moved to refuse.</p>
<p>"Your lungs suffered from the exposure, not necessarily permanent, unless you ignore my instructions." She checked the incense burner and nodded at whatever she saw within. </p>
<p>"May I ask who you are?"</p>
<p>"Wen Qing," she said without ceremony. </p>
<p><em>Wen Qing</em>, Meng Yao silently repeated to himself. It remained a bleeding sore in his father’s side that remnants of the Wen still existed when he had advocated so strongly for their elimination. While he’d publicly backed the Nie-Lan offers of clemency for the non-cultivators who survived the war, he privately seethed over what he considered to be disrespect of his wishes. By the time he’d arrived at Nightless City, to hear tell, the decision to spare the civilians had already been made, and he’d been denied the opportunity to have his say in the matter. Those who remained gathered in their home on Dafan Mountain. </p>
<p>"I was sent for after Chifeng-zun found you half frozen to death."</p>
<p>Somehow, despite Zixuan's words earlier, he'd doubted the severity of his condition (though he'd gone into the snow with no intention of returning). From Wen Qing, he believed it, though he still wasn't sure how he felt about having failed. Failed them again. Failed to be honest. Failed to redeem himself. Failed to keep the one secret he'd hoarded against his heart since burying his mother among all the other dead prostitutes of Yunping. </p>
<p>"I'm going to loosen some of your muscles to ease your breathing," she told him, retrieving a sleeve of acupuncture needles from across the room. "Move forward and lay on your stomach."</p>
<p>She efficiently adjusted his body with brusque hands and then took a place at his side to begin easing needles into his back. The tension slowly eased away, and the laborious heaving of his lungs eased with each inhale.</p>
<p>He must have looked truly pathetic when Nie Mingjue and Lan Xichen walked in a short time later.</p>
<p>"Chifeng-zun, Zewu-jun." There was an odd tone to Wen Qing’s voice Meng Yao could not immediately parse. </p>
<p>"Lady Wen," Lan Xichen answered. Nie Mingjue said nothing. "We are interrupting."</p>
<p>"Yes," she agreed. She slid another needle into Meng Yao’s back. </p>
<p>Heavy silence pervaded the room, and Meng Yao lacked the strength to break it. After all, what could he say that they'd care to hear? Perhaps his hesitancy to speak drove the sad sigh he heard drawn up through Lan Xichen's chest, and the dissatisfied rumble from Nie Mingjue. For a moment, Wen Qing placed a hand against Meng Yao's back, sans needle, and he wondered if she understood.</p>
<p>"Would you like me to summon you when I've finished?"</p>
<p>"'Summon' us?" Nie Mingjue growled.</p>
<p>"Mingjue, please." Meng Yao could imagine the look on Lan Xichen's face. The strain he got around his eyes when trying to play peacemaker. "Yes, Lady Wen. If you could."</p>
<p>They left together.</p>
<p>"I didn't realize the remnants of the Wen were so close to the Two Lords,” Meng Yao murmured. For all they’d defied Jin Guangshan’s wishes around their annihilation, no reports existed to indicate they held any further ties.</p>
<p>Wen Qing did not reply until she finished the course of treatment, and when she did she made no mention of his remark.</p>
<p>"I don't have to call them back," she told him, tidying up the remainder of her workspace.</p>
<p>"You don't like them," Meng Yao surmised, mystified. He couldn't fathom anyone with good judgement disliking Lan Xichen, and Nie Mingjie for all his gruffness, tended to command respect if not admiration. </p>
<p>"I came at Wei Wuxian's request," she said. It spoke volumes. “None of us would still live, if it weren’t for him." Wen Qing briskly changed the subject, "You know about us, but are not blooded." Us? The Wen? No. There was a certain weight behind the proclamation he’d come to associate with dragons. </p>
<p>"Blooded?" he repeated.</p>
<p>Wen Qing explained, "A child of dragons who was not born true or a human gifted with blood by one of our kind." He could guess from context what born true meant; hadn't Jingyi said it of A-Yuan when he'd first turned?</p>
<p>"I am not. What does that mean for me?"</p>
<p>Wen Qing paused. "There have been very few humans who know our secret without being blooded. If you look for them now, you will not find them." She turned back to him to check his back. "When I draw these out, you will be very relaxed and tempted to sleep. I can find ways to keep you awake if you wish to speak to them."</p>
<p>Meng Yao thought of the gentle disappointment in Lan Xichen's tone, and what look Nie Mingjue must have had in his eyes when he'd been fully apprised of Meng Yao's treachery, certainly hidden away when he’d come to retrieve Meng Yao from the mountains.</p>
<p>"Sleep sounds like a safer option," he whispered.</p>
<p>Perhaps he let slip more than he realized, as Wen Qing followed up with, "It is not cowardice for an injured animal to retreat and hide until its wounds are fully healed." </p>
<p>He was asleep before she'd removed the third needle.</p><hr/>
<p>The cycle of waking-treatment-sleeping continued far longer than Meng Yao felt comfortable with. On the one hand, he was pleased they hadn’t sent him away (thrown him down the stairs) from the Unclean Realm (yet). On the other, waiting for repercussions became a painful anticipation which made his muscles clench and resulted in Wen Qing’s ongoing annoyance when it undid her hard work. Zixuan outright stated Meng Yao would be permitted to stay, but while it could be attributed to his brother’s optimism, and quite possibly true, he could not imagine what he’d done would be so easily overlooked. He counted his sins on every needle pushed into his skin, and dreamt about them when they were removed. </p>
<p>Lan Xichen and Nie Mingjue did not return. </p>
<p>That being said, once Wen Qing announced him capable of staying awake for longer periods of time without exacerbating his illness, every other member of the household decided to trod their way through his door in a relatively steady stream of company. </p>
<p>Jiang Yanli came first and was, perhaps, the only one he expected to join him besides Zixuan. He had been uncharitable towards her when he’d first seen her; her beauty really shone through when one came to appreciate her kindness. </p>
<p>“Whenever A-Xian was trapped in bed when we were children, I made him soup,” she announced, gracing both Meng Yao and Wen Qing with a warm smile. </p>
<p>Meng Yao’s brow furrowed. “Not Jiang Wanyin?”</p>
<p>“Dragons don’t fall sick very often, and when we do it is generally nothing soup can cure.” ‘We’ he whispered to himself. He could only imagine Jin Guangshan’s reaction to the statement; little wonder Wei Wuxian had been so insistent on them living out of the Unclean Realm. She ladled out a steaming bowl of something that somehow managed to smell of home and love, underlain with beef and ginger. “It’s not as fine as I could manage in Lotus Pier, of course, and my brothers would both be upset if I made their favourite for you and wouldn’t share.” </p>
<p>He almost offered to share, then took a bite and realized that, no, he had no plans to do so at all. </p>
<p>Jiang Yanli sat back and watched him carefully. “A-Xuan tells me he’s spoken with you.” Meng Yao reluctantly nodded, though he kept his eyes fixed on his bowl. “Did you understand what he said?”</p>
<p>“I believe so, Lady Jiang.” </p>
<p>“Yanli-jie,” she corrected. </p>
<p>He frowned at his bowl. “I’m afraid you are all trying to foist intimacies upon me I do not deserve and have not earned.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps, but they are ours to offer.” She reached out and touched his hair, and his heart ached for his mother. “And in case no one tells you otherwise, you are free to decline them.”</p>
<p>His spoon froze halfway to his mouth. “Why would I?” Not rhetorical, he wanted her insight. He had his own reasons for reluctance, of course, but what did Jiang Yanli see when she looked at him? </p>
<p>“For fear of giving yourself power over us, perhaps. Power you would be afraid of abusing,” she replied, as though she had not succinctly summarized his true nature and not trembled at the grotesquerie of it. </p>
<p>The spoon trembled in his hand. “You see quite a bit, don’t you, Yanli-jie?”</p>
<p>Jiang Yanli inclined her head and refilled his bowl.</p><hr/>
<p>Jiang Yanli’s visit prompted more. Wei Wuxian swept into the room later that afternoon with an armful of loquats and dropped down next to Meng Yao, tumbling the fruit across the bed. Where had he even acquired loquats this time in the year? They looked suspiciously fresh. </p>
<p>“Here,” he said, passing the one over. “You’re about to be subjected to the typical parade, and I thought it might be good for you to keep up your strength.”</p>
<p>Meng Yao stared at the fruit. “Dare I ask?” </p>
<p>“Eh, whenever anyone gets injured we all end up in the recovery room eventually.” He looked at the loquat in Meng Yao’s hand expectantly until he took a bite. He detected the faintest whiff of spiritual energy, perhaps to keep it fresh. “I keep them around all year for Lan Zhan. I’m not sure if he likes them all that much, but I once threw one at his head and now they make him smile.</p>
<p>“Now then.” Wei Wuxian placed his hands on his needs and regarded Meng Yao very seriously. “I think shijie gave you the soft talk, yes?” </p>
<p>“Is this where you threaten me?” He’d been expecting it, after all. If not from Wei Wuxian, then from Nie Mingjue.</p>
<p>“That’s going to come whenever Jiang Cheng stops making eyes at Wen Qing and drags himself in here.” We Wuxian leaned forward. “You’ve only been with us for half a year. I knew, when Jin Zixuan asked me to get you out of Koi Tower—” </p>
<p><em>What?!</em> “What.”</p>
<p>Wei Wuxian sighed. “You were never a chicken, Meng Yao. Your brother wanted you out of Koi Tower and I agreed to it, even knowing what Jin Guangshan would ask of you. I saw it in his eyes after you left the meeting. We didn’t not trust you, but hoped that you’d be able to create ties with us strong enough to keep you from actually doing it.”</p>
<p>Meng Yao chewed over this a moment, now that time had distanced him from his rage when Zixuan had admitted as much the first time. “Why take the risk?” It made no sense. Only one wrong move or moment would have resulted in Jin Guangshan knowing everything about all of them, and Meng Yao considered himself clever enough to easily orchestrate it. “You don’t know me.” </p>
<p>“The House—”</p>
<p>“You, Wei Wuxian, were the one to decide to bring me here. I can somewhat understand Zixuan’s desire to do so, but you were the one to ultimately make the call. Nothing can convince me you’d blindly do what Zixuan asked of you, and while you’re idealistic to the point of suicidal, you’re not an idiot. The benefit didn’t outweigh the potential loss.”</p>
<p>Wei Wuxian looked down at his hands, clenched into white-knuckled fists atop his legs, lips twitching. “Someone took a risk on me once.” He seemed determined to snap himself out of whatever maudlin thoughts possessed him, because a moment later he looked up with an obviously forced grin. “I like this version of you, by the way, saying what you mean.” </p>
<p>The sound of yelling from outside the door drew their attention and Wei Wuxian relaxed his fingers from where they were still clenched tight. “Well, here’s the loud part. Good luck. Remember, he usually doesn’t follow through on his threats, but don’t talk back just in case he’s in a mood.” </p>
<p>Like the consummate asshole he was, Wei Wuxian opted to open the window and creep out instead of facing his brother’s temper. Jiang Wanyin stormed in seconds later in a bluster of threats against Meng Yao’s extremities, barely pausing to take in a breath despite walking into a gust of winter air. </p>
<p>“...And why the fuck is this window open?”</p><hr/>
<p>“Teacher! We wrote a song for you to help you feel better."</p>
<p>Meng Yao snapped awake with a start; he hadn’t even noticed he’d nodded off. He ledger he’d been reviewing—snuck into him post-tantrum by Jiang Wanyin as a favour to stem off the boredom of the sick room, and conspicuously only detailing the records of Lotus Pier—sat open on his lap. He blinked the sleep out of his eyes and tucked the ledger to the side to grace Jingyi and A-Yuan with a smile. Lan Wangji stood behind them, A-Yuan’s guqin in hand. </p>
<p>"Did you?" Meng Yao cast a pleading look at Lan Wangji. The non-committal eye he received in return spoke worlds, and most of them unanimously chorusing, ‘you deserve this.’</p>
<p>Meng Yao sat through all twelve verses, which seemed to cover everything from a plea to avoid injury in the future to condemnation of Master Nie Liu’s teaching skills. It was actually quite sweet, he had to admit, especially when Jingyi went out of his way to freestyle his assurances that while Meng Yao was terribly bossy and being forced to learn the biographies of famous scholars the worst torture ever inflicted, they hoped he'd resume lessons with them soon.</p>
<p>It was very enthusiastically done. </p>
<p>At the end of the song, the boys settled in for a visit and to report on everything they’d learned since Meng Yao left them after A-Yuan’s first change to his dragon form. Apparently this ‘Master Nie Liu’ lacked some basic context regarding clan history outside that which involved the Nie, and Meng Yao resigned himself to having to reteach a number of incorrect assumptions about the formation of traditional borders. </p>
<p>Eventually, Lan Wangji herded the boys out—presumably into incompetent academic hands—but returned to Meng Yao's side moments later.</p>
<p>"I will play for you, if I may?"</p>
<p>"After I've already been so excellently serenaded?"</p>
<p>A small, almost invisible smile touched the corners of his mouth as he withdrew his guqin and began strumming a familiar melody. The spiritual energy suddenly pervading the room soaked into Meng Yao's very marrow, easing him towards rest. This, beyond anything else, impressed him with the oddity of how the household must view him; Lan Wangji never impressed him as the forgiving type. Between him and Lan Xichen, Meng Yao imagined the latter to be the one willing to play.</p>
<p>He had yet to see either him or Nie Mingjue since Wen Qing turned them away. </p>
<p>The last notes of the song drew to a close, and Lan Wangji turned to go. </p>
<p>“Second Young Master Lan,” Meng Yao said. Lan Wangji paused and regarded him closely. “I can understand the forgiveness of others. Jiang Yanli, Zixuan. Even Wei Wuxian and Jiang Wanyin. But I feel forgiveness without sign of proper repentance is not in your nature, and I have done nothing to show earnest regret for my actions.” </p>
<p>Lan Wangji’s lips pressed together. “The boys value you very highly. And trust you implicitly as their teacher.” Meng Yao nodded, though the words sat heavy in his gut. “It would have been very trivial of you to abuse this trust when you saw A-Yuan change, yet your first action was to seek out my brother.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao considered this. “I do not wish to see them harmed.”</p>
<p>“This is why you have no need of forgiveness from me.” He pressed his hands together and bowed deeply, as though Meng Yao was a person of greater standing. A man of worth. </p>
<p>“Thank you,” Meng Yao replied, and for good measure, “Hanguang-jun.” </p>
<p>The smallest sliver of a smile touched Lan Wangji’s mouth, and he showed himself from the room.</p><hr/>
<p>On the seventh day after he'd woken, Wen Qing finally declared him fit to leave her care, albeit with strict instructions not to overexert himself. Having spent such close quarters together in the meantime, she’d impressed him with her ruthless dedicationt to his welfare, if not her taste in men. </p>
<p>"If I have to spend another two weeks under the roof of the Nie, a little cold will be the least of your worries," she told him strictly.</p>
<p>"Understood," Meng Yao said quietly. "And may I compliment the fine new comb in your hair?"</p>
<p>Wen Qing glared at him. He stared back impassively until they both nodded in silent accord.</p>
<p>Zixuan arrived to help him back to his room, a strong presence at Meng Yao’s side as he slowly hobbled away from the healer’s. The hallways of the Unclean Realm bit with the winter cold, and when Meng Yao shivered Zixuan tugged him closer. </p>
<p>“May I ask you something?” Meng Yao questioned. Zixuan nodded. “The Two Lords…” He paused, not sure what he wanted to ask. He had been the one hesitant to see them, after all. Perhaps because, of all the forgiveness he’d received, it was theirs he wondered about the most. </p>
<p>“Whenever you’re ready.” </p>
<p>Might be a while, then. Still didn’t the avoidance make things easier, in some ways? Zixuan said he wanted to give Meng Yao something else to live for, but without the Two Lords supporting the idea, he’d be hard-pressed indeed. </p>
<p>Despite the words he wondered if they might be waiting for him at his door to help him settle for the evening. While there was someone standing amidst his things, it was the wrong Nie entirely.</p>
<p>"Leave him with me, Zixuan," Nie Huaisang said.</p>
<p>His brother hesitated, a brief tension that lasted all the way through what quickly became an uncomfortable silence. Finally, he looked to Meng Yao. "I can remove him, if you don't want him here."</p>
<p>Nie Huaisang whined in protest, but Meng Yao shook his head, though he was touched Zixuan offered to stand against the House on Meng Yao’s behalf. "It's fine." </p>
<p>Still unsure, and rather sweetly so, Zixuan finally nodded and left them together. Once the door closed behind him, Nie Huaisang’s demeanour changed entirely, from spoiled child to straight-faced adult. Meng Yao had seen glimpses of it before, notably when Nie Huaisang had helped him recover from his father’s beating, but this was far and away the most serious he’d ever seen the other man. It suited him surprisingly well, leaving Meng Yao to wonder at how easily he’d fallen for the deceptive, considering how many masks he employed on his own. </p>
<p>"Tea?" Nie Huaisang offered.</p>
<p>"Shouldn't I be the one offering?" Meng Yao asked.</p>
<p>Nie Huaisang hummed, but poured for them both anyway. After a week of the astringent medicines Wen Qing had dumped down his throat, Meng Yao was ready for a change, even if it meant the burnt tree branches stewed in water that passed for tea in the Unclean Realm. When Nie Huaisang offered him a cup of a pleasantly floral blend instead, he looked at the other man with surprise.</p>
<p>Sitting across from one another, they stared each other down, both taking occasional sips of tea.</p>
<p>"Tell me, Yao-ge, what do you think of my fan?" Nie Huaisang snapped it open to show off the same hideous specimen he'd showcased in their first meeting.</p>
<p>Meng Yao's lips pulled, though not in anything that might be called a smile. "It's an abomination of colour, poor line work and nonsensical arrangement of theme. Jingyi could do better while blindfolded with his own ribbon, and if it never assaults my senses again I'll die a happy man."</p>
<p>"Very good," Huaisang told him. He closed it and passed it over. "It's all yours. I'm sorry to say that all the others you had have been mysteriously destroyed, but this one should serve you well." He produced another, much more tasteful specimen from his sleeve for his own use.</p>
<p>"You're too kind," Meng Yao said. He angled for sarcasm and missed by a mile. “Are you…?” </p>
<p>“Blooded,” Nie Huaisang replied, a slightly regretful downturn to the corner of his mouth. “My father was born true, as well as Da-ge’s mother, but not mine. For a long time, he believed himself to be the last.” There was a wealth of meaning in there; out of habit, Meng Yao tucked it back to the recesses of his mind for review at a later time. "Zixuan says you're planning to kill your father." </p>
<p>Ah, so he’d made it common knowledge. How delightful everyone could now share in condemnation of Meng Yao’s debasement. He could not imagine either Nie Mingjue or Lan Xichen being willing to forgive such desires. ‘When you’re ready,’ indeed. Little wonder they were avoiding him. </p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"I assume you have a plan in place, if not yet in motion." Meng Yao nodded. "Tell me. I think between the two of us we can really make him suffer."</p>
<p>Meng Yao's eyebrow twitched up. "Would your brother approve?"</p>
<p>"Da-ge's approval means everything to me, but not at the expense of his safety. Do you think he'll continue to be safe once your father realizes that you're no longer of use to him, and sends someone without unreconciled trauma to spy on us? Someone who might do it for the money?" His face twisted in disgust.</p>
<p>"I am perfectly reconciled to my trauma, thank you," Meng Yao told him pertly.</p>
<p>Nie Huaisang fanned himself and waited patiently.</p>
<p>Well, a second opinion couldn't hurt. "Very well. Though I’m not sure why you’re interested in helping me.” </p>
<p>“Jin Guangshan sent a spy into my home to uncover secrets he has no right knowing, for the purpose of injuring my family.” Nie Huaisang’s eyes narrowed. “There are sins I do not forgive.” </p>
<p>“Zixuan seems to think if I follow through it will lead to my damnation.” </p>
<p>“Zixuan isn’t taking into account that you might do so with someone else’s help and support. Having someone who truly knows you goes a long way in maintaining one’s sanity, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>Meng Yao tilted his cup up in acknowledgment, and settled in to plot.</p><hr/>
<p>"He's back in his room, now," Xichen said that evening, brushing out his hair as they prepared for bed. "We should go to him."</p>
<p>Nie Mingjue held back a sigh. "We agreed to wait until he comes to us. We can't force it."</p>
<p>Xichen lowered his comb and bowed his head. He unreasonably shouldered most of the blame for Meng Yao's impromptu hike, despite Mingjue's reassurance that if anyone was to blame it was Jin Guangshan, the fucking toad. Two years separated them from the Sunshot Campaign, and Xichen had apparently forgotten the tremendous amount of work Yanli-jie had put in to turn Jin Zixuan into something even beginning to resemble a decent man. And for all he had come to respect his soon-to-be brother, he did not come with halfsomuch baggage as Meng Yao. </p>
<p>Fortunately, he and Xichen both had shoulders broad enough to help bear the burden.</p>
<p>"If I thought I had betrayed our family, I would do something worse than a poorly-planned walk into the snow."</p>
<p>Xichen turned a frown his way. "Please don't jest, Mingjue."</p>
<p>"I'm not." Their eyes met and held a few moments. Not bothering to withhold the sigh this time, Mingjue stood and crossed the room to take the comb from Xichen's hand. He continued the ministrations with a gentle touch. </p>
<p>"We should blood him," Mingjue decided.</p>
<p>"Yes." Xichen tilted his head up, and accepted a not-entirely chaste kiss. "It will bind him tighter to us." </p>
<p>Not that blooding meant a guarantee of loyalty, as Wen Ruohan proved. Mingjue's jaw clenched as it always did when the blasphemies of the deceased Sect Leader came top of mind. Having Wen Qing in the Unclean Realm did nothing for his temper, even if the two of them had come to their grudging peace with one another. It was difficult for Mingjue to look at her without remembering that he'd almost cleaved Wuxian in twain, that there still existed a small scar sitting at Wuxian's hairline because Mingjue almost couldn't pull his blow when Wuxian had inserted himself between her and Baxia. Having her so close sat ugly in his stomach, because it reminded him that while Wuxian had forgiven him, joined his flight and called him Da-ge, Mingjue wasn't confident he'd forgiven himself.</p>
<p>Part of his reluctance to attempt another visit to Meng Yao's side was, perhaps, fuelled by her presence in their infirmary. He and Lady Wen would never be friends, for all he appreciated the assistance she offered them.</p>
<p>"After the wedding," Mingjue suggested.</p>
<p>"That won't be until the fall," Xichen said with disappointment.</p>
<p>"Give him some time to learn our ways, Xichen. He's clever, it won't take him long, but he should know what he's committing to before we force anything upon him."</p>
<p>"I would never!" Xichen insisted.</p>
<p>"A poor choice of words, husband. I beg your pardon." Mingjue pressed another kiss to his mouth apologetically. "I know you wouldn't."</p>
<p>Mingjue began running the comb through his thick hair again, and Xichen's eyes drifted shut in contentment after a few moments of care. He relaxed backwards into Mingjue's chest. The first time Mingjue had done this, fresh off the battlefield, blood matting Xichen’s beautiful tresses down to his scalp, he'd thought Xichen would look lovely in Nie braids. Satisfying, all these years later, to know he had been right.</p>
<p>When he finished, reluctant as he was to put down the comb, he undid Xichen's ribbon, and allowed his husband to bind it about his wrist. Mollified, Xichen rose and waved Mingjue into his abandoned seat, nipping the comb easily from his hands. Feeling indulgent, Mingjue acquiesced and allowed Xichen free reign of his hair. His braiding had come along, the artistry almost as fine as those born into the Nie. He finished with a simple sleeping plait and ran his fingers along the side of Mingjue’s neck, curling around to his jaw, cupping his face in his warm palm. </p>
<p>The first time he’d looked upon Xichen, his thoughts sang of frost. The Gusu Lan were only just recovering from Wen Ruohan’s first foray into domination, scouring the world for dragons to feed his desire to assume power to which he was not born and could only aspire. Cloud Recesses burnt to ashes. And there stood the Sect Heir, untouchable and ferocious and preparing to bring devastation upon those who had harmed his people. </p>
<p>Wangji had been sent away with the most precious of the books, leaving Xichen to protect those who remained. Holed up in a warded underground cave, they’d managed to withstand the assault of the Wen until Mingjue and his forces showed up to offer assistance. When he’d looked on Xichen and seen winter, the sort that brought devastation and death, he hadn’t known he was looking upon another dragon. He’d thought himself to be the last. Wen Ruohan must be furious in death that his aim of shaking free other dragons hidden within the human Clans for his own purposes would end up uniting them against him instead.</p>
<p>Discovering Xichen’s true nature hadn’t come until much later, with the taste of Xichen’s blood in his mouth as his own soaked the earth beneath him, the man himself staring down at him in a mix of astonishment and awe. </p>
<p>Before the Sunshot Campaign, Mingjue despaired of A-Sang’s love of irony. He’d since come to appreciate it.</p>
<p>(Another irony: the man Jin Guangshan sent to destroy them might end up being the man’s own death walked through their door.)</p>
<p>“Come to bed,” Xichen whispered. </p>
<p>Mingjue turned his head to kiss Xichen’s palm and stood to follow his husband.</p><hr/>
<p>Meng Yao slowly made his way on his own to the classroom the next morning, met by Master Nie Liu, who had the audacity to look surprised to see him. </p>
<p>“Thank you for your assistance these past weeks, Master Nie Liu,” Meng Yao said with a bow. “I am pleased to resume my lessons with the boys.” </p>
<p>Nie Liu appeared deeply unimpressed. “I have some concerns about the content of your lessons, Master Meng.” Meng Yao waited for him to continue. Flustered when he ventured no questions, Nie Liu continued, “The Nie have never felt it necessary to include philosophical discourse in our history teachers. We are objective in all things.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao highly doubted it. “Then how fortunate for them the boys are Lan.” </p>
<p>Nie Liu’s face twisted angrily. “While you are in the Unclean Realm, it would behoove you to follow our customs.”</p>
<p>“While I am in the Unclean Realm, I will strive to bring honour to the Nie Clan and the Unclean Realm, per the Clan motto. Were I derelict in my educational attempts with the boys, I would not be doing such words justice.” </p>
<p>“You think you understand our words better than I? You, the son of a wh—”</p>
<p>A quiet voice—not to be mistaken for a soft one—interrupted. “Your pardon.” </p>
<p>They both turned to the doorway, where Lan Wangji stood with the boys. A-Yuan and Jingyi were practically vibrating with excitement, wide-eyed and ready to jump to Meng Yao’s side. Meng Yao smiled softly in their direction, even as Nie Liu stiffened beside him. </p>
<p>“Good morning, young masters. Are we ready to continue our lessons?” Meng Yao asked.</p>
<p>It seemed all the permission they needed. A-Yuan, in a very familiar maneuver he’d never executed with Meng Yao as a target, leapt forward and wrapped himself around Meng Yao’s leg, pushing his face into Meng Yao’s thigh. Jingyi seemed more interested in attempting to jump high enough to meet Meng Yao’s gaze at eye level. Nie Liu appeared deeply unimpressed. </p>
<p>“May I speak with you, Nie Liu?” Lan Wangji asked, his voice ice-covered steel. Meng Yao was surprised to realize he’d learned the limited facial tells of the other man well enough to recognize that he was furious. How delightful.  </p>
<p>Nie Liu shifted uncomfortably, but nodded and followed him from the room. </p>
<p>“Both of you take your seats now,” Meng Yao told them, gently easing A-Yuan away from his leg so he could take his spot. As he did, he brushed the top of the boy’s head with his knuckles and earned an expansive smile. </p>
<p>Little over an hour later, A-Yuan sneezed, and once more there was a petite dragon hovering in the air before him. He seemed incapable of controlling how his body moved in the air. Jingyi jumped to his feet to try and tackle him again, but froze in place when Meng Yao turned a stern glance his way. He settled down with limited grumbling. </p>
<p>“A-Yuan,” Meng Yao said. The dragon twisted around to meet his eyes. “You can understand me when I speak to you in this manner, correct?” A-Yuan very deliberately nodded his head. “Excellent, then we shall wait until you are back to your human body before continuing with calligraphy, and instead turn to philosophy for the time being. I shall try to pose my questions to you in ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to allow you to participate.” </p>
<p>A-Yuan moved forward and slid over and around Meng Yao, sending full-body shivers running through Meng Yao’s veins. </p>
<p>“No fair he gets to hug you,” Jingyi grumbled. </p>
<p>“Let us talk of fairness for today’s lesson, then.” </p>
<p>Unappeased, Jingyi cast another somewhat irritated look towards A-Yuan before settling in for his own learning. </p>
<p>A-Yuan was back to human in time for their music lessons. Instead of a guqin, Jingyi had apparently decided to try his hand at drumming, which Meng Yao suspected to be both Wei Wuxian’s suggestion and an effort to conciliate some of his more exuberant tendencies. Despite the disparity of styles, he had little doubt Lan Wangji was up to the task of teaching both at once. </p>
<p>“Nie Liu will no longer be responsible for the teaching of children in the Unclean Realm,” Lan Wangji told him, settling behind his own guqin and pulling up his sleeves. </p>
<p>“Unnecessary,” Meng Yao said through the swell of his heart. Lan Wangji graced him with a sceptical eye. “But thank you.”</p>
<p>Lan Wangji nodded and turned his attention to the boys. </p>
<p>Meng Yao stood outside the door exactly long enough to hear Jingyi’s first attempts at rhythm before deciding to retreat. </p>
<p>He paused at the turn of the hallway which would take him to Lan Xichen’s room. Would he be waiting? </p>
<p>Uncertainty proved too tiresome for Meng Yao to deal with. Shoulders back, head up, he made his way to Lan Xichen’s receiving room. </p>
<p>After Nie Huaisang had left the night before, and indeed during much of his convalescence, he’d given thought to what to say to the Two Lords. Words tripped over one another as he’d ordered and reordered them to find a way to express himself. </p>
<p>Meng Yao had never been ‘good.’ Conducting oneself honourably had its benefits only in that it made one more palatable to society at large, and he’d long come to terms with the knowledge that there were few things he would not do to advance his place in life enough to avenge the death of his mother. The Unclean Realm hadn’t instilled any values in him, but he found himself wanting to remain. And perhaps behaving with goodness was an acceptable substitute when one could not be inherently good.</p>
<p><em>What is fair?</em> he had asked Jingyi and A-Yuan. In all fairness, Lan Xichen and Nie Mingjue should have cast him out, or left him to die on the mountain. He didn’t want to consider himself in their debt, but he felt he owed it to them to be, if not the ideal to which they all aspired, close enough to be acceptable. </p>
<p>Lan Xichen looked up at his arrival, and stood with a glowing smile stretched wide across his face. “A-Yao.”</p>
<p>“I would like to continue my lessons,” Meng Yao said. He started to bow, only for his elbows to be caught in Lan Xichen’s gentle hands. </p>
<p>“Please don’t. Please.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao straightened. “I feel I should speak with you and Nie Mingjue.”</p>
<p>“I’ll summon him. In the meantime, may I play for you? You still look quite pale.” </p>
<p>Nie Mingjue joined them only a few minutes later, and Meng Yao did not want to accuse him of hovering, but he did wonder where he must have been to have been retrieved so quickly. He settled in next to Meng Yao to listen to the remainder of Lan Xichen’s playing. Meng Yao did feel better afterwards, which bolstered his confidence enough to speak his mind. </p>
<p>“Undoubtedly Zixuan has told you everything said between us,” he began. Lan Xichen and Nie Mingjue did him the service of listening without interruption. “I understand now you welcomed me here not under false pretenses, as I had feared, but with full understanding as to what my purpose in coming was. I would like to confirm, here and now, that I have no plans to betray this  House in any capacity. You have given me—” Kindness, respect, a home, friends, family, “—more than was due to me considering the intentions I brought with me into the Unclean Realm. I wish to thank you for that.” He bowed low enough his forehead touched the floor, and while he heard Lan Xichen shift to stop him, he also trusted Nie Mingjue to understand why he could not. </p>
<p>He took his time rising. “I also understand Zixuan’s plan to...rehabilitate me may not be tenable with consideration to these prestenses and intentions. I understand that, as the Two Lords of Jade and Blades, you have made many difficult decisions. Should one of those decisions run counter to Zixuan’s plans, please believe my sincerity when I say I understand completely.” He couldn’t look at them, and chose to keep his eyes on the ground. </p>
<p>“And if we are in support of Zixuan’s plan?” Lan Xichen asked. </p>
<p>“I shall try to be worthy of it.” He paused. “Mostly. I am beginning to appreciate the value of speaking my mind.” </p>
<p>Nie Mingjue shifted in place. “I would rather you did, Meng Yao. I’ve never had patience for false faces.”</p>
<p>Meng Yao’s lips twitched, but he did not smile. “You must be mightily tired of me, then.”</p>
<p>“I think knowing to look for the mask stopped it from being the disguise you believed it to be,” Lan Xichen offered. Nie Mingjue nodded. “We will accept your service, Meng Yao. And, in time, should you wish to join us, we will accept you into the House.” The finality of the words sent a shiver down Meng Yao’s back. </p>
<p>“Thank you.” </p>
<p>Lan Xichen gestured to the waiting guqins. “Shall we?”</p><hr/>
<p>Bundled in their warmest clothing, they gathered to say goodbye to Wen Qing the next morning, Nie Mingjue conspicuous in his absence. Meng Yao gathered, from snippets of conversation he’d picked up while in the infirmary, bad blood existed between them though he had not discovered why. </p>
<p>“Thank you for your expertise, Lady Wen,” he said with a bow. </p>
<p>“You have proven one of my less challenging patients,” she told him. To his left, Jiang Wanyin huffed in annoyance and she turned to him. “Yes? Jiang Cheng? You wish to refute that? Certainly not with your own experiences under my needles.”</p>
<p>“I would think a doctor would be hard-pressed to rank her patients.”</p>
<p>“I found it very easy. You were the worst by far.” </p>
<p>They glared at each other, until Jiang Wanyin finally broke and managed a surprisingly soft smile. “Safe flight.” </p>
<p>Her eyes warmed. “Goodbye.” </p>
<p>She shifted into a beautiful gold-scaled dragon, close in appearance to A-Yuan with her brilliant feathered wings. Almost in sympathy the boy snapped into his dragon form as well, and Wei Wuxian had to grab a hold of him to stop him from floating up after her as she lifted into the sky and took wing. Jiang Wanyin watched her with longing eyes, confirming yet again to be the most unfortunately expressive man Meng Yao ever met. No wonder he shouted; anger had to be the only way he could convincingly hide whatever else he felt. </p>
<p>“You should probably just marry her,” Wei Wuxian said once she’d crossed over the nearby peak. </p>
<p>“You should probably just shut your fucking mouth,” Jiang Wanyin growled in return. </p>
<p>“A-Cheng, I have been happily married for longer than you’ve been alive—”</p>
<p>“Wei Wuxian, I swear—”</p>
<p>“—And I have a world of experience in convincing someone objectively better than you to take you on.” </p>
<p>Lan Wangji looked like he wanted to argue, but demurred when A-Yuan and Jingyi took off to play in the untouched snow around the landing. </p>
<p>At least Jiang Cheng looked thoughtful. Ah, brotherhood. </p>
<p>It wasn’t a teaching day for the boys, and Nie Mingjue had already sequestered himself with his administrative tasks, leaving Meng Yao somewhat at odds. </p>
<p>Momentarily, at least. The moment he started to start back, Wei Wuxian’s attention snapped to him and he left Jiang Cheng to muddle over whatever dubious advice he’d provided.</p>
<p>“Come along, then, Yao-ge,” Wei Wuxian said, slipping his arm through Meng Yao’s. He frowned sidelong. “Qing-jie gave us strict instructions for making sure you recover as quickly as possible, and that includes getting you to the training fields to help build up some more muscle.”</p>
<p>Meng Yao blinked. “...training fields. Wei Wuxian, the training fields are currently buried under five feet of snow.” </p>
<p>“They <em>were</em> buried under five feet of snow. You’re welcome.” </p>
<p>Once they reached the field, Meng Yao half-shaking with trepidation, Wei Wuxian took his measure. Literally. He made Meng Yao stretch out his arms and looked them over before darting into a nearby armoury and producing a serviceable practice sword.</p>
<p>"Have you used a blade before?" he asked.</p>
<p>Meng Yao pursed his lips. "A dagger only.” He slipped the concealed blade from his sleeve to a nod of approval. “Never a sword. My mother bought books on cultivation, and I used to practice the footwork exercises, but she always said my… said Jin Guangshan would provide a real sword for me when he legitimized me."</p>
<p>Wei Wuxian did him the honour of not offering up pity or soft words. "Those books are garbage. I once caught one of the authors peeking over the walls of Lotus Pier to get ideas for his 'manual.' I wouldn't be surprised if all of them came about the same way. Not a single one written by someone who held a sword." He grinned. "Fortunately for you, you have an embarrassment of choice for which form would suit you best."</p>
<p>"I am confident embarrassment will be playing a part in this."</p>
<p>Wei Wuxian laughed and then kicked at his feet until he repositioned them in a satisfactory manner.</p>
<p>Meng Yao wasn't all that confident, an hour later, that Wen Qing had deliberately prescribed a course of treatment that involved him sweating so profusely his robes half-froze to his body, but he had to admit it felt satisfying. Even without a spiritual weapon, the movements through which Wei Wuxian had guided him thrummed in his veins; his poorly-developed golden core sang to him in songs he'd never heard before, and he did feel better.</p>
<p>The bone-deep aches crept up on Meng Yao steadily over the rest of the day, and he barely managed to get himself back to his room after dinner. He believed Wei Wuxian’s insistence that the exercise had been at Wen Qing’s command, but surely he was meant to take a more measured approach?</p>
<p>“A-Yao.” He turned and nodded in greeting to Zixuan as his brother approached. “I have this for you.” He withdrew a small pot from his sleeve. “It should help with the muscle pain. Wuxian is an excellent teacher, and demands excellence in his students.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao noted the surprising lack of reluctance in the assessment, and accepted the pot with a small nod. “Thank you. I’m surprised to hear you speak so well of him. I thought you two often found yourselves at odds.” </p>
<p>“We do.” Zixuan opened his door and waved to invite Meng Yao inside. He entered the room with some small reluctance; it was the first time he’d seen the inside of his brother’s accommodations after all. The room looked well-appointed and lavishly decorated as befitted a man of his stature. Tucked in among the golden decor and comfortable furniture were touches of lotuses and purple fabrics, which Meng Yao regarded with quiet amusement. </p>
<p>They sat for tea, which Zixuan poured for them both. </p>
<p>“Wuxian has ideas about what is best for A-Li. And while I can appreciate the desire to protect her, he often overlooks the fact that she is perfectly capable.” Zixuan’s face twisted. “I have been guilty of overlooking these capabilities in the past, and he and Jiang Cheng were both reluctant to forgive my offenses. Are still, to a certain extent. Part of the reason I’m spending a year here is to prove I can manage more than five minutes in her presence without offending her, a feat I was incapable of accomplishing when we first met.” </p>
<p>“It must have made that month you spent together difficult,” Meng Yao commented. </p>
<p>“You have no idea,” Zixuan admitted with an uncharacteristically open scoff. “Despite this, though, I hope I am able to acknowledge his strengths. He very admirably managed to keep up with Jiang Cheng when they were children, despite Jiang Cheng’s natural advantages.” </p>
<p>“Another dragon,” Meng Yao said. </p>
<p>“Sandu Shenghou,” Zixuan told him. “Though more than that I cannot tell you without his blessing.” </p>
<p>“Why did it fall to Wei Wuxian to assist me?” Had Zixuan not wanted to? </p>
<p>Zixuan’s brow acquired the small line between his eyes that only ever appeared when he was annoyed. “It was determined I would be too gentle with you.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao smiled into his tea.</p><hr/>
<p>Winter clung to the walls of the Unclean Realm with vicious pleasure, hanging on with a seemingly unbreakable grip. </p>
<p>“Much longer and the farmers will be unable to get their spring planting in,” Meng Yao muttered to himself one morning, reviewing reports from the territory. </p>
<p>Lan Xichen and Nie Mingjue exchanged measured looks. “One more week,” Lan Xichen finally nodded. </p>
<p>“Until what?” Meng Yao asked.</p>
<p>“Until we intervene.” </p>
<p>The snow persisted, though the sun made regular appearances throughout the day. Meng Yao had mostly forgotten Lan Xichen’s words until he was roused from bed late one evening by Zixuan, who respected him enough, at least, to knock on his door to get him out of bed. They slid along the impacted ice leading to the landing, where Meng Yao found every adult dragon in the Unclean Realm awaiting them. Wei Wuxian turned and regarded them both with a smile as they fell into line beside him. </p>
<p>He was of course familiar with Zewu-jun, Chifeng-zun and Hanguang-jun, but this was his first opportunity to look his fill at the Jiang siblings. In the darkness, their scales were indiscernible from the velvety blue of a moonlit sky, and he could only imagine what they would look like in the sun. </p>
<p>“We thought you might want to be here,” Zixuan said, gripping Meng Yao’s shoulder and watching with wonder as the five dragons rose into the air together. They seemed to float upwards into the sky above, disappearing through the heavy cloud covering together. </p>
<p>“What are they going to do?” Meng Yao asked. </p>
<p>The distant rumble of thunder caught his attention, and only a few minutes later the first drop of rain splashed against his forehead. </p>
<p>“It takes a toll on them,” Wei Wuxian stated. “They’ll sleep all day tomorrow.” </p>
<p>The rain came quicker, light droplets that seemed to caress his cheeks before sluicing down to gather at the neck of his robes. It would melt the remaining snow, he realized. And hopefully start to thaw the ground. </p>
<p>True to Wei Wuxian’s words, not a single one of them was available the following day. Meng Yao took over for Nie Mingjue in an endless series of meetings with a small cadre of petitioners looking for aid; they’d all braved the torrential rain outside, and it was the least he could do to make sure their concerns were heard. Wei Wuxian released him from his relentless exercise regime, and even corralled the boys into something resembling a respectable day, though more than once Meng Yao found himself pausing in his speech to wait for the sounds of childish delight to quiet enough for his words to be heard. </p>
<p>“You must understand what you’re asking for is quite impossible,” he continued once the screaming had abated. </p>
<p>The merchant in front of him scowled. “Why?”</p>
<p>“I have already explained the reasoning,” Meng Yao replied evenly. “We have a mutual and exclusive agreement with one of your competitors which we are not at the liberty or, honestly, the inclination to break at this time.” </p>
<p>“I’m confident upon hearing the value I can bring, the Two Lords—”</p>
<p>“You will find the Two Lords trust my judgement, sir. You’re welcome to remain in the Unclean Realm until you’ve decided on your next destination, but I’m afraid your proposal is declined.” Meng Yao handed the sheaf of papers to the attendant standing at his left, who returned them to the merchant with a shallow bow. </p>
<p>The merchant’s mouth twitched into a dissatisfied moue, but stood and bowed. “Thank you for your time, Young Master.” </p>
<p>He turned, prepared to leave, when Meng Yao coughed to catch his attention. “If you are looking to broaden your trade, you might try the Han. The distance between their territory and this one is comparable, and you may find they have no similar trading agreements in place.” </p>
<p>The merchant blinked and bowed again, deeper. “Thank you sir.” </p>
<p>Once he was gone, Meng Yao looked to the attendant. “Any other appointments for the day?” </p>
<p>“No sir.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. Please see tea is sent to the Two Lords, Sect Leader Jiang and Lady Jiang, as well as a meal if they desire. I’m not confident they’ve been well enough to request anything for themselves. Once that’s completed you may retire for the evening.”</p>
<p>The man bowed and whisked himself out. Meng Yao, smiling with no small amount of satisfaction, rose to go in search of Wei Wuxian and his charges. </p>
<p>He found them near the stables, ignoring the harried looks of the stablehands and plying Wei Wuxian’s donkey with a shocking number of preserved apples. </p>
<p>“Keep it up and that donkey will be so fat you won’t be able to sit astride it,” he commented mildly. </p>
<p>“Teacher!” The boys chorusing was… gratifying and Meng Yao rewarded both of them with a smile. </p>
<p>“She’ll be fine!” Wei Wuxian protested, offering up the last sliver, which the donkey accepted with little grace. “She’s seen me through since the war.” He attempted to pet the donkey’s nose, to which the animal responded with a grunt and turned away, now apples were no longer luring him to the end of his stall. </p>
<p>“Perhaps now you can tell me why you choose to ride a donkey at all.”</p>
<p>“Once you’ve been a dragon’s rider, you can’t ever ride a horse again.” Wei Wuxian shrugged. “Dragons don’t like it.”</p>
<p>“Dragons… don’t like it? Horses?” Surely that wasn’t right. </p>
<p>“At all. It's a thing. As well as my mistress Lil Apple treats her unworthy rider, I would much rather be on horseback. But every horse I've ridden since the war has mysteriously vanished from the stables. And I <em>know</em> Hanguang-jun isn’t eating them, is the thing. They're just. Gone. Could be an entire herd of wild horses running amok in Qinghe somewhere right now and we'd never know.” Perhaps noting the way Meng Yao’s face twisted in response, Wei Wuxian frowned. “All right?” </p>
<p>“I had no idea dragons could be ridiculous. It’s a rather stunning realization.” </p>
<p>Wei Wuxian grinned and herded them all out to the evening meal. It was certainly quieter, with only the four of them and Zixuan in attendance. Meng Yao rather thought Wei Wuxian missed his usual sparring partner in Jiang Wanyin, not to mention the subtle affections of his spouse. </p>
<p>After dinner, Meng Yao paused before heading to his room, and instead made his way to the quarters shared by Lan Xichen and Nie Mingjue. If they were asleep, he vowed, he would leave them be. If they answered his gentle knock…</p>
<p>“Come in.” </p>
<p>He let himself inside. Both the Two Lords were awake, though dressed only in simple under robes. They looked exhausted, despite the day of rest. He was gratified to see, however, his instructions had been carried out and there were empty dishes next to the door awaiting collection. </p>
<p>“I thought I would see how you both fared,” he offered. “And perhaps you’d allow me to practice my middling guqin skills by playing for you.” </p>
<p>Lan Xichen smiled wanly. “You’ve gotten quite good, Meng Yao.”</p>
<p>“As you well know,” Nie Mingjue harrumphed. </p>
<p>“Any progress I’ve made has been because of your instruction,” Meng Yao said. Then, daringly, “Er-ge.” Lan Xichen looked pleased, and Meng Yao decided to forgive himself the presumption.</p>
<p>He took a seat at Lan Xichen’s guqin and set to playing. It lacked the spiritual power a performance by Lan Xichen himself might have produced, but he felt it a serviceable attempt. Nie Mingjue half passed out before the first movement was done, and Lan Xichen treated Meng Yao to a peek at their easy affection as he smiled adoringly at his spouse. </p>
<p>Meng Yao ached for it, though he couldn’t say if it was for Lan Xichen, Nie Mingjue, or the look in and of itself.</p><hr/>
<p>“You’re overextending,” Zixuan told him, watching from the side of the field as Meng Yao moved through the training exercise Wei Wuxian had left him with. </p>
<p>Meng Yao gritted his teeth and adjusted his stance. The sword still did not feel entirely natural in his hand, not the extension of his body suggested by Wei Wuxian, but he did feel as though he’d made progress. </p>
<p>“It’s not a problem during training, but it could result in someone getting up under your guard if you’re in a real battle.” </p>
<p>“No offense, da-ge, but if I’m ever in a real battle then I doubt my skills with a sword will be my saving grace,” Meng Yao pointed out. </p>
<p>“Don’t underestimate yourself.” Zixuan’s mouth twisted up unhappily. “You’ve come a long way since starting with Wuxian.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao eased out of the stance and bowed. “Thank you. But should I ever need to dispatch an enemy, I think I shall have to rely on treachery.” </p>
<p><em>Here are the places to strike, my love, if you need to cripple a man. And here to avoid the breastbone to drive a blade through their heart.</em> </p>
<p>Zixuan moved to join him, pulling Suihua from its scabbard. He took a place beside Meng Yao and slowly went through the same movements. It felt distinctly odd to see him working within the freedoms of the Jiang style, but he seemed unaffected by the vast differences. Meng Yao lined himself up alongside his brother and attempted the same easy grace. </p>
<p>Once Zixuan was satisfied, they faced each other to allow Meng Yao to mirror the movements. Zixuan was a competent teacher. More than once, when seeking him out in Koi Tower, Meng Yao had found him working with the Jin disciples, taking them through their paces with the senior disciple standing by to watch. Meng Yao suspected his brother preferred such activities to the actual governance necessities of leadership. </p>
<p>Perhaps he’d overestimated his familiarity with the Jiang style, however. When they returned to their starting position, Zixuan’s hand moved at the exact wrong angle and strayed into the path of Meng Yao’s blade. He jerked backwards with a small grimace of pain, quickly banished, though a small splatter of blood trickled down his robes. </p>
<p>He waved off Meng Yao’s apologies as his own fault, and was halfway through correcting himself by going through the motion when Yanli-jie burst onto the training fields. </p>
<p>“A-Xuan!” she called, eyes somewhat wild. She calmed at the sight of them, though there was still a quickness of step Meng Yao hadn’t seen from her before. “I…” She looked back and forth between them, at a loss.</p>
<p>“It was an accident, A-Li,” Zixuan assured her. He held up his hand, and she moved to inspect it. </p>
<p>“I. Oh. Just… the blood.” Her lips pursed unhappily. “I worried.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao regarded them blankly until Zixuan motioned to the white jade charm hanging from his waist. Meng Yao noted the blood marring the otherwise pristine carving, caught during the dribble down the length of his robes. </p>
<p>“If you would like to examine his wound, I would be happy to chaperone,” Meng Yao offered in lieu of another apology. They both turned fond eyes on him. “I understand these things are occasionally best viewed under open skies, and the walking paths to the west have been cleared.” </p>
<p>Yanli-jie patted the side of Meng Yao’s head, in a way very similar to that which she’d offered Jiang Wanyin and Wei Wuxian when they’d done something particularly endearing (to her). </p>
<p>“Thank you, A-Yao,” she said. </p>
<p>Zixuan tucked his sword away and offered her his arm.</p><hr/>
<p>Zixuan’s year in the Unclean Realm was almost up and, by all appearances, he would press his suit with Yanli-jie and officially join them. Xichen couldn’t pretend it wasn’t a relief, though an ugly part of him still hesitated to call Jin Guangshan kin. He saw the same reluctance reflected in Mingjue’s eyes as well, and the same guilt over the reservations. After all, keeping Zixuan also meant keeping A-Yao and despite the ugliness of their father, he and Mingjue did intend to keep A-Yao. </p>
<p>The year would end at sunset, and he’d gathered all the members of the Household of the Two Lords on the steps at the entrance to the Unclean Realm, Meng Yao and Zixuan facing them from the ground below. Someone, likely Yanli-jie, had made sure they were both bedecked in their finest robes. </p>
<p>Family greetings, after all, were much different than those of anyone else who might pass through their doors. </p>
<p>“Young Master Jin, if you are here it means you are a part of our House. It means you are prepared to love and protect the others within these walls, and live your life freely but in service to this commitment. You are free to stay as you will, and may leave at any time, but acknowledge that you will not leave our hearts even in parting. Do you remain in the Unclean Realm with a full understanding of this?” </p>
<p>“I acknowledge this to be true,” Zixuan said with a demure smile. Xichen noted, with a small smile of his own, that his eyes remained fixed on Yanli-jie as he spoke. Once he was finished, he stepped forward and joined them on the stairs.</p>
<p>Meng Yao looked directly at Xichen and Mingjue, unwavering. </p>
<p>“Young Master Meng, if you are here it means you are a part of our House. It means you are prepared to love and protect the others within these walls, and live your life freely but in service to this commitment. You are free to stay as you will, and may leave at any time, but acknowledge that you will not leave our hearts even in parting. Do you remain in the Unclean Realm with a full understanding of this?” Mingjue asked. </p>
<p>“I acknowledge this to be true,” Meng Yao agreed, chin lifted. </p>
<p>“We have something for you as well,” Xichen said. He nodded to Zixuan, who proudly stepped forward, producing a small box from his sleeve. “To recognize that your place is now with us.” </p>
<p>Zixuan opened it to present the white jade sword charm. Meng Yao stared at it as though afraid to accept, his shaking hands reaching out to brush across it. </p>
<p>“I.” He stopped, overcome. “I will try to be worthy of it.” The words echoed those he’d spoken to Xichen and Mingjue when recovering from his illness. He had lived up to them, as Xichen was confident he would also live up to the trust now being presented. “Thank you.” </p>
<p>“We’ve prepared a feast in honour of you both,” Yanli-jie said a moment later. </p>
<p>“And then, tomorrow, we start preparing for the wedding!” Wuxian grinned. </p>
<p>Meng Yao looked relieved as they all began to file back inside, towards the reception hall, likely because none of them mentioned the tears gathered in his eyes.</p><hr/>
<p>Zixuan and Yanli-jie agreed to move forward with things (not that there had been any doubt from any corner, perhaps save the small one inhabited by Wei Wuxian, and only then on a performative basis) the wedding preparations swept across the Unclean Realm. Jiang Wanyin and Wei Wuxian had lofty ideas for their sister’s wedding—emphasized and embellished moreso by Lan Xichen, who took an empathic interest the music—and between the three of them and a seemingly limitless budget, it was turning into a dramatic affair the likes of which probably wouldn’t be seen again for centuries. With so much focus on other aspects of the union the contract had not gone into nearly enough details and the oversight apparently allowed the bride’s family to run absolutely rampant. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, what the whole ridiculous cadre of overenthusiastic idiots enjoyed in ambitions, they lacked in organizational capacity. Except for Nie Huaisang, who shook his head and claimed to know nothing, but wasn't this particular silk merchant known for poor seams, and wouldn't this other one be better suited, not that he professed to be an expert, but perhaps someone should check? All commented upon from behind his fan as his eyes tilted upwards, having driven everyone into a frenzy of trying to verify the claims and make sure that necessary perfections were achieved. Meng Yao wasn’t sure why he even bothered anymore, other than keeping up appearances. </p>
<p>(Nie Mingjue washed his hands of the whole affair, and told everyone he would be busy with Nie Clan matters until the day of the wedding. When pressed as to which Clan matters could be so important, he recalled something very urgent he had to do and showed himself from the room).</p>
<p>Thus, with only the slightest twitch of the eye, Meng Yao put himself forward as the cornerstone for organization and planning. </p>
<p>“I appreciate it,” Nie Mingjue told him one evening, late into the night after Meng Yao harried Wei Wuxian and Jiang Wanyin away from his notes. </p>
<p>“As well you should,” Meng Yao replied. “But one more comment scribbled where it doesn’t belong and we’ll also be planning a funeral. Two funerals,” he corrected himself. “Three if Nie Huaisang says one more fucking thing about silk.” </p>
<p>Nie Mingjue pressed a broad palm to his back. “We all value your assistance, A-Yao.” </p>
<p>“Value it from another room. I have work to do.”</p>
<p>Nie Mingjue left with a chuckle, but a short time later one of the servants brought him a small jar of wine, so Men Yao considered the otherwise inexcusable levity forgiven.</p>
<p>Early the next morning, rousted from what he considered to be a well-earned nap (passed out across his desk amidst his papers, a involuntary reprieve of only a few minutes), Nie Huaisang hastily shoved Meng Yao into respectable robes and dragged to the main gates to stand and greet the new arrival. She arrived with a small cadre of cultivators and two imposing women at her back, both of whom wore identical expressions of diffidence, matched by the cunning neutrality of their mistress.</p>
<p>Yu Ziyuan. The Violet Spider. Regent of Yunmeng. The bride’s mother. </p>
<p>Both Lan Xichen and Nie Mingjue stood to welcome her, the former speaking the traditional words of greeting. He’d gotten to understand the greetings, now. Only dragons and blooded were offered the courtesy and protection the words provided. </p>
<p>“Madam Yu,” the Lord of Jade began, “You come here in celebration of your daughter’s wedding. You are welcome to stay for the entirety of the proceedings and as long as you please afterwards to share your joy in the celebration. You are to be accorded every respect, as we likewise expect you to respect the members of his household.” Now <em>that</em> was interesting. Meng Yao had not heard such an affixation to the greetings beforehand; respect for the House was always an inherent expectation, regardless of who walked through the gates. “Do you enter the Unclean Realm with a full understanding of this?” </p>
<p>“I acknowledge the truth of these words,” she said. While the members of her party all bowed, she remained standing, much like Wei Wuxian had that first day. What did it mean, she did not bow to the Two Lords? Meng Yao hated missing context, he always assumed it meant people knew more than he did and it was something he could not countenance. “A-Cheng, A-Li, come.” </p>
<p>Jiang Cheng and Jiang Yanli broke away from the gathered bodies and went to their mother. She looked them over with a critical eye, slightly narrowed, as her people streamed by her to be shown to the guest houses set aside for the visitors of Yunmeng, quite a bit closer to the family quarters than any other guests could boast. “They are keeping you well?” </p>
<p>“Yes, mother,” Jiang Cheng assured her. </p>
<p>Her chin tilted upwards. “And you are conducting yourselves with respectability and honour due to your hosts?” </p>
<p>“Our brothers, mother. And yes,” Jiang Yanli replied evenly. </p>
<p>“Hm. Brothers. As though they were hatched from my own nest.” She slit a glance towards the rest of the House and snapped out, whip-quick, “Wei Wuxian, is this how you greet me?” </p>
<p>Wei Wuxian broke away and half-stumbled down the stairs, skidding to a stop before her and bowing with far more reverence than even the regent of Yunmeng deserved, especially considering the manner in which he’d greeted his Sect Leader. “Madam Yu.” </p>
<p>“Let me look at you. Still embarrassing us? Your robes are a mess.”</p>
<p>Nie Huaisang leaned over, snapping his fan out to cover his mouth as he whispered to Meng Yao, “Believe it or not, this is worlds better than it used to be.” </p>
<p>“Really?” Meng Yao asked. The words didn’t shake him—he’d lived with similar, if not worse, every day he’d spent in Koi Tower—but he wondered at the fond look in Wei Wuxian’s eyes. </p>
<p>“Mm. After Lan Wangji blooded him and he technically belonged to the Gusu flight, it forgave some of his sins.” </p>
<p>“Where is your son?” Madam Yu continued. </p>
<p>“In lessons, Madam Yu,” Wei Wuxian reported truthfully. Others had taken on the boys’ education while Meng Yao lost himself in wedding planning. He had vetted the potential educators very carefully to ensure they could be trusted with such an important task. “He’ll see you at the ceremony tonight.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao blinked and looked at Nie Huaisang. “Ceremony?” </p>
<p>“Jin Zixuan’s blooding,” Nie Huaisang replied. “You were doing so much work with the human part, we didn’t want to tax you with the dragon half.” </p>
<p>Lan Wangji descended the stairs at a much slower pace and came to stand beside Wei Wuxian to offer his own greetings. Madam Yu greeted him with far more civility, though a cutting remark about his failure to make Wei Wuxian respectable snuck in regardless. He took it with far more grace than Meng Yao had expected, considering the subject matter. </p>
<p>“What’s involved in the blooding?” Meng Yao asked. It felt safer than unpacking the questionable dynamic of Madam Yu and her children. </p>
<p>“You’ll see tonight.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao blinked. “I’ll what?” </p>
<p>Once the sun had well and truly set that evening, Lan Xichen showed up at his door with a surprisingly plain black robe and waited for him to arrange it before leading him through the Unclean Realm to the landing. He stumbled, slightly, at the sight of all of the dragons of the House, Wen Qing, and a dragon he did not recognize, stood alongside one another, save Yanli who waited apart from the rest. Lan Xichen motioned him towards Nie Huaisang, Wei Wuxian, Jingyi, who spotted him and waved. Meng Yao gratefully slid in beside him and Wei Wuxian. </p>
<p>“I don’t understand why I’m here, Wuxian,” he admitted out of the side of his mouth. </p>
<p>“You’re the groom’s brother,” Wei Wuxian reminded him. </p>
<p>“I am honoured.”</p>
<p>“Make sure to tell him that,” Wei Wuxian said. He tilted his eyebrows and Meng Yao followed his gaze to where Zixuan had appeared on the path. He walked with dignity towards Jiang Yanli, though even in the dark Meng Yao could tell his neck was bright red. As he approached Jiang Yanli, she shifted back to her human form and smiled with quiet serenity. </p>
<p>“A-Xuan,” she said. “Thank you.” </p>
<p>He bowed low before her. “I am, and always will be, unworthy of you.”</p>
<p>“We finally agree on something,” Wei Wuxian muttered. Meng Yao elbowed him sharply in the side and he quieted. </p>
<p>Was his brother to drink a cup of blood? Meng Yao couldn’t guess how it worked, and waited in bated breath as the other dragons began to circle them. They curled around the two, hiding them completely from view by moving in concentric circles, Chifeng-zun on the outside as the largest among them. They spun faster with every turn, and Meng Yao gasped as thunder rumbled above them, turning his gaze to the sky at the massive stormhead rolling in through the mountains to obscure the moon and stars. </p>
<p>"Is it always this wonderful?" Meng Yao breathed.</p>
<p>Wei Wuxian didn't immediately answer, and when he looked over, the other man's eyes were clouded over with old pain, aging him far beyond his years. "No. Sometimes, on the battlefield, there's no time for ceremony if you want to save the life of the person you love." </p>
<p>Before he could offer a reply, Jingyi tugged on Meng Yao’s robes and he bent over. “What happens if A-Yuan can’t hold his form?” he asked. </p>
<p>“No one would ever let him come to harm, I promise you,” Meng Yao said. If he knew nothing else about this affair, he knew that with the utmost certainty.</p>
<p>Jingyi nodded, but grabbed Meng Yao’s hand and held on tightly as the odd dance before them continued. </p>
<p>Finally, with a crack of lightning threatening to tear the sky itself apart, everything seemed to freeze. The sky opened up and a torrent of rain broke upon them. Jingyi screamed in delighted surprise and Meng Yao had to shut his eyes against the sudden torrent, though he couldn’t help the smile crawling across his face. </p>
<p>Huaisang nodded. “The sky and storms bless them.” </p>
<p>“The sky and storms bless them,” Wei Wuxian echoed with enthusiasm, his voice only slightly choked. He laughed and pushed a handful of wet hair back out of his face. </p>
<p>“Should we go inside?” Meng Yao asked. </p>
<p>“Not yet,” Wei Wuxian replied, his voice at a yell to be heard over the pounding of the rain. Another rumble of thunder, though not nearly as violent, shook through the air as though the sky itself woke from slumber with a violent yawn. His new robe clung to Meng Yao, but he didn’t feel dragged down. Quite the opposite: more than anything, the fresh scent of the rain buoyed him in ways he’d never felt before. </p>
<p>The dragons slowly peeled off and away from the couple, leaving space enough for a small bundle of humans to approach. </p>
<p>“Come on!” Wei Wuxian grabbed Meng Yao’s hand and hauled him along, barely giving him time to pause to collect Jingyi before they were charging forward. True to Jingyi’s fear, A-Yuan was back to his human form, but clutching tightly enough to Jiang Yanli’s legs that he must have been well out of the way of the others. Wei Wuxian scooped him up as soon as they came within arm’s reach. </p>
<p>“Congratulations, shijie,” he said, hugging her tight. She was laughing and crying, and Meng Yao saw the same emotions dancing across Zixuan’s face. </p>
<p>He grabbed his brother’s arm. “Congratulations.” He wasn’t sure exactly what he was congratulating, but Meng Yao thought he could see the smallest trail of blood dotting the corner of Zixuan’s mouth, though much watered down from the rain.</p>
<p>“I’m glad you were here, A-Yao,” Zixuan told him with all appearances of honesty.  </p>
<p>“Time for your first flight, then,” Wei Wuxian said. “If Meng Yao doesn’t mind putting the boys to bed.” </p>
<p>“It would be my pleasure,” Meng Yao replied honestly. </p>
<p>Jiang Yanli shifted again—the air crackling with the changes, as well as the hair-raising feeling of the lightning overhead—and with minimal awkward scrambling on Zixuan's part, he managed to get himself onto their back before they took wing.</p>
<p>Hanguang-jun approached and lowered himself to allow Wei Wuxian to step onto his front leg and wrap an elbow around the greatest of his  horns. They lifted into the sky, followed by many of the others. An elegant dragon resplendent with indigo scales he suspected to be Madam Yu, if only by process of elimination, rose fast on Sandu Shengshou’s tail.</p>
<p>Before he joined them, Zewu-jun shifted back and came to Meng Yao’s side. “I’m sorry you can’t join us tonight, A-Yao.” </p>
<p>“Don’t be. I’m just happy to have been a part of this.” He blinked in shock, realizing the words to be sincere. </p>
<p>Lan Xichen seemed to understand as well. “We’ll see you in the morning.”</p>
<p>“Fly safe,” he replied. </p>
<p>Zewu-jun soon rose with the others, leaving only Meng Yao, Nie Huaisang, and the boys on the ground. A-Yuan looked after the others with longing, but submitted to Nie Huaisang scooping him up into his arms. </p>
<p>“Let’s get you both into some warm clothes, and maybe we can find something sweet from the kitchens if you promise not to tell your parents,” Meng Yao offered. </p>
<p>Slightly cheered, A-Yuan tucked his face into Nie Huaisang’s neck and they headed back to their rooms. </p>
<p>Later, once the boys were tucked into bed and curled around one another like cats, Nie Huaisang opened a jar of exceptionally good wine and poured them both a cup.</p>
<p>"I understand why I'm not up there," Meng Yao said. For all he understood himself to now be part of the House, there was a certain unspoken intimacy in riding a dragon, and the only dragons he could even speculate sharing such a thing with were already married to each other. "But why didn't you go along?"</p>
<p>Nie Huaisang snapped his fan open and adopted an officious air. "There is protocol and tradition to follow when it comes to dragons. A dragon, should they ever agree to take a rider, will only ever take one in their lifetime. And while I could have gone, being carried in their claws is, I can tell you right now, terribly uncomfortable."</p>
<p>"And heavens forbid you experience any discomfort," Meng Yao said, dry as dust.</p>
<p>Nie Huaisang refilled his cup, and offered a smug smile.</p><hr/>
<p>The sect delegations began to arrive two days later. Meng Yao's arrangement of the guest housing was a work of art, truly something to be proud of, and his seating plan for after the ceremony should have been held up as an example of political grandmastery.</p>
<p>Or it would have, if Nie Huaisang had not been sent by all the hells to torment him.</p>
<p>"Where, exactly, will you be sitting Yao-ge? Because it seems you've forgotten to assign yourself a seat."</p>
<p>Meng Yao blinked. "Ah. Huaisang, I—"</p>
<p>"I know it cannot <em>possibly</em> be that you're planning on missing your brother's wedding. Even if you're not included in the tea pouring—which everyone thinks is ridiculous, but is willing to overlook given that Jin Guangshan <em>must</em> be included—you cannot expect they'll let it slide for you to bow out of the rest."</p>
<p>"A-Sang," The House, to a one, could be directed by open shows of affection. It was how he has stopped Wei Wuxian and Jiang Wanyin from being assholes about the flower situation, "I have attended the ceremony that matters. I would be of much better use behind the scenes assisting the servants."</p>
<p>Nie Huaisang snapped his fan shut with far too much flare. "Are you suggesting the servants of the Unclean Realm are incapable?"</p>
<p>Meng Yao gritted his teeth. "No."</p>
<p>"Have you provided them with clear directions which are easily followed?"</p>
<p>"I know what you're doing," Meng Yao hissed.</p>
<p>"I am trying to make sure that the groom's brother, who he loves very much, is present to celebrate his marriage to his bride, who would be shockingly disappointed if that same brother did not attend." Nie Huaisang glared with such ferocity it suddenly reminded Meng Yao of the often overlooked fact that despite their differences, he and Nie Mingjue were indeed brothers. "If you think that Wei Wuxian and Jiang Cheng will suffer Yanli-jie being at all disappointed on her wedding day with anything resembling grace, you haven't been paying attention. I am preventing another war, Yao-ge. This is in service to my country, Yunmeng, and all the casualties that would surely result. Now, <em>where will you be sitting</em>?"</p>
<p>Meng Yao scowled at the seating plan. </p>
<p>At least it presented an interesting mental exercise, not unlike a game of weiqi with an accomplished opponent. He could not sit with the Jin; Jin Guangshan would never stand for it, and he'd prefer to be as far away from his father, Madam Jin, and Jin Zixun as possible.</p>
<p>The Lan might have been an option, but they would already be subject to scrutiny with the presence of Wei Wuxian within their ranks. For all he and Lan Wangji were married, Wei Wuxian still primarily honoured Jiang customs, and having a second outsider among them instead of the Lan senior disciples would make them look weak.</p>
<p>Sitting with the Nie could be a viable option, especially with the limited family numbers, but that would put him close to the Jin. As hosts, they were seated closest to the families of the bride and groom.</p>
<p>He set himself to pondering, and Nie Huaisang allowed him to stew over the question in silence for a single, precious minute before deciding to offer his own commentary.</p>
<p>"With Da-ge at the front of the hall, I of course have no one sitting beside me."</p>
<p>"If you want to avoid starting a war, you absolutely cannot insist Jin Guangshan's bastard son be seated beside you. It would be seen as a slap in the face of every respectable Clan member. And it would stain your own reputation."</p>
<p>"My reputation takes care of itself quite nicely. I'll just shake my head and tell everyone that I don't understand why a valued member of our House can't sit next to me."</p>
<p>"There are limits to what people will fall for, Huaisang. Pick your battles. Besides, as Senior Disciple, Nie Zonghui has more than earned the spot."</p>
<p>Nie Huaisang tapped his chin with the tip of his fan. "Behind me on the right, then. It will put you two seats over from Jin Zixun—far enough to keep him from speaking to you, unless he wants to shout—and close enough to make a statement. Nie Xiu has been angling for a way out of attending anyway."</p>
<p>Meng Yao frowned. "She's Second Disciple. She's earned the seat."</p>
<p>"I think she's more interested in attending the private party the rest of our cultivators are arranging. Apparently they will have better alcohol."</p>
<p>Alas, it was likely true. Jin Zixuan had been insistent on serving his favourite, a very delicate chrysanthemum wine that would be wasted on almost everyone in attendance as soon as they had more than one cup. Considering it was the only request he'd made the entire time, Meng Yao felt it important to oblige him. He and Wei Wuxian had already made arrangements for a significant quantity of their stores of excellent Zhu liquor to be placed strategically about the room for the more deserving of the guests anyway. He'd have to make sure the servants knew to place one on his table as well.</p>
<p>"Very well." He made the necessary change and Nie Huaisang grinned at a job well done. "But since I have to go and communicate these changes, I'm afraid you'll have to be the one to greet Sect Leader Yao when he arrives."</p>
<p>Nie Huaisang's face twisted in dismay. "No fair, Yao-ge, I've just prevented a war! I should be rewarded for my efforts."</p>
<p>"If you talk very slowly, Sect Leader Ouyang should arrive before you're finished. The two of them are more than capable of entertaining each other." Like gossiping old aunties. "They'll forget you're even there."</p>
<p>Nie Huaisang considered this a moment, then nodded decisively and took off to greet their impending guests.</p><hr/>
<p>The ceremony completed—Mingjue could reluctantly admit it had been lovely despite Wei Wuxian and Jiang Cheng making teary spectacles of themselves—which only left this endless meal and reception to slog through. While ecstatic for Yanli-jie and Zixuan, Mingjue privately vowed never to host such an affair out of the Unclean Realm ever again. Or Qinghe, for that matter. For all things were going smoothly, the number of people present in his home—significantly more than a typical discussion conference, which he could at least justify to himself as being a necessary evil—made him uneasy. Baxia was unsettled. He wanted nothing more than to change and take flight into uncomplicated skies, and thanks to the number of potential witnesses, he couldn't even do something as simple as a late night flight.</p>
<p>The next one of them to be married would have to go to Gusu, he decided. Let Lan Qiren deal with the headache of it all. The recalcitrant old bastard could glower even better than Mingjue himself, and was certainly better at keeping his temper.</p>
<p>(In truth, it was more likely to be out of Yunmeng, but that didn’t bear thinking about). </p>
<p>Thank the heavens Meng Yao secreted some of the good liquor onto his table. People were still filtering in, small bundles of conversation happening across the room as old friends greeted each other, and jars of wine were already being prodigiously refilled by servants who’d somehow managed to pick up Meng Yao’s trick of disappearing while in plain view. Xichen had drifted over to where Lan Wangji took the head seat of the Lan, Lan Qiren still tucked away in Cloud Recesses and wisely avoiding such frivolousness, as was his wont. Considering both Xichen and Wangji were present, as well as their respective spouses, there was no inherent insult in him declining to attend. </p>
<p>Oh, yes, Mingjue thought bitterly as Sect Leader Yao tried to catch his eye. Lan Qiren would definitely be hosting the next wedding. </p>
<p>The representatives of the Nie arrived just late enough to be polite while still drawing attention. Huaisang headed the group of four, alongside Zonghui, who admirably convincingly looked as though he wanted to be here. Meng Yao entered behind them, and Mingjue’s stomach curled in warm triumph at the sight of him in Nie colours. It had been a collective decision for members of the House to avoid their personal heraldry to satisfy both wagging tongues and the egos of their respective birth clans. This affair was already far too political to allow any of them to show off the deep roots of their alliance, but everyone looked very finely attired nonetheless. He found Meng Yao's new hairstyle especially interesting, as he could easily detect A-Sang’s hand in the braids, and he was relatively confident the hairpiece had belonged to A-Sang's mother. It was a statement, but not one anyone outside the Nie, or the House, would or could appreciate.</p>
<p>Meng Yao took the place Huaisang had helpfully picked out for him, and was immediately accosted by Wei Wuxian. Mingjue marked several eyes turning towards them and shoved down raised hackles. Meng Yao looked content enough, and after a full year of wearing him down it wasn’t as though Mingjue couldn’t tell when he was faking it. </p>
<p>Xichen took his hand, decorously hidden by their sleeves. "Our wedding was significantly calmer, wasn't it?"</p>
<p>"It was a political affair in the middle of a war. We couldn't have paused for all… this." Still, he didn't begrudge Yanli-jie, not in the face of her radiant joy.</p>
<p>Xichen's smile was fond and regretful all at once. "Do you wish it had been different? A love match?"</p>
<p>"I am allowed to have you in my arms every night, A-Huan. However you came to be there I am grateful." He boldly lifted Xichen's hand up and pressed his lips to the back of his knuckles. No one was watching them anyway.</p>
<p>Well, almost no one. </p>
<p>Madam Yu pointedly cleared her throat beside them. "Set a good example for my daughter if she's to continue living here," she scolded. </p>
<p>Xichen bowed his head to hide his smile. "Our pardon, Madam Yu."</p>
<p>A raucous laugh caught Mingjue's attention and he glanced at the Jin party. One of the cultivators had spilled wine across his lap, having obviously overindulged as the night went on. With eyes now aimed in his general direction, Jim Guangshan took the opportunity to stand. </p>
<p>And here they'd been having such a nice time.</p>
<p>"Allow me a moment to thank our esteemed hosts. I could not be more honoured to have the Jin united with such a prestigious collection of clans. My son was most wise to forge such an alliance.” </p>
<p>What an exceptional way to ignore the bride all together. From the set of Madam Yu’s mouth, it had not gone unnoticed. </p>
<p>“Through the Jiang’s connection to the Nie and Lan, this brings all four of the major Clans under one roof, and ensures our prosperity for years to come. I know Sect Leader Jiang will agree that this has been to the benefit of everyone.” Of course, before Jiang Cheng could say anything, Jin Guangshan muscled on. “It is my honour, as the father of a single son, to see him well situated and in the position to bring the Jin glory in the future.” </p>
<p>Mingjue cut a look towards Meng Yao, satisfied when he saw the other man was unaffected. Jin Guangshan’s eyes swept across the room, pausing on Meng Yao himself. He seemed momentarily disgruntled, but permitted himself a last boisterous chuckle before sitting back down. </p>
<p>“I am likewise happy for my cousin,” Jin Zixun stated, standing to pick up where his uncle left off. “But this time of separation has been difficult for us. Having been close since boyhood, we have been as brothers. And as the only brother he has, I’m sure he shares my sentiments.” </p>
<p>Xichen pressed his hand firmly against Mingjue’s, as though he couldn’t be trusted to control himself. His temper remained in check; what did it matter if the Jin made a show of dismissing or excluding A-Yao? He belonged to the House now. </p>
<p>“And with this in mind, I will ask to be allowed to trespass on the generosity of our hosts after the wedding to share in his joy and help celebrate properly.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao had failed, and so Jin Zixun was to be the replacement. They could not have been less subtle than if he’d put the words to song and dance. Putting it outwards so publicly obligated them to agree; with such statements of love and friendship, forbidding Jin Zixun from staying would make them look ill-mannered.</p>
<p>A-Sang, looked over his shoulder towards Meng Yao, and the two shared an unreadable look. While Mingjue trusted them to have things in hand, he wasn’t altogether sure how he felt about the two of them plotting.</p>
<p>“Thank you, cousin,” Jin Zixuan said, standing. Yanli-jie, visible only to Mingjue and Xichen from their position behind them, wrapped her hand around his ankle. “And we of course are happy to have you here. But I do need to correct an assertion. I do have a brother, and I am honoured by his presence here tonight, as without him I can safely say that this entire affair would not have been possible.” He lifted his cup. “Meng Yao, my greatest respects to you.” </p>
<p>The House, and most of the guests, lifted their cups to drink. Meng Yao’s faithful mask slipped back into place, cheerfully gracious in acceptance of the words, and barely covering the shock to those who knew him.</p>
<p>Mingjue emptied his cup and leaned over to Xichen to whisper, “Did you know he was going to do this?” </p>
<p>“I did not,” Xichen replied through the smile tilting up the corners of his mouth. “But I am proud of him.” </p>
<p>The Jin were the only ones not to lift their cups, even Sect Leader Yao reluctantly joining in the toast when Sect Leader Ouyang nudged his friend’s side, and Jin Zixun shot Meng Yao a look filled with so much venom Mingjue privately decided to walk Meng Yao back to his room that evening. </p>
<p>The banquet wore on until the early hours of the morning, and Mingjue suspected he saw the beginnings of dawn peeking over the mountaintops by the time they’d seen the last of their guests back to bed. Only him and Meng Yao remained—Xichen having given up later than the usual Lan bedtime, but early enough that Mingjue’s side felt colder in his absence. </p>
<p>“I think I shall sleep through the next wedding,” Meng Yao declared, finishing what little wine remained in his jar. He’d remained remarkably sober; the same couldn’t be said of most of their guests. </p>
<p>“Fortunately there aren’t any more on the horizon.” </p>
<p>Meng Yao smirked. “We shall see.” </p>
<p>Mingjue glowered, though there was little heat in it and the amused curl of his lips probably betrayed his good humour. “What are you plotting?” They made their way from the reception hall, the new shift of servants immediately rushing in to begin clearing away the mess left behind. </p>
<p>“Nothing, Da-ge. But I may have been asked to sit in on a certain conversation with Madam Yu, Jiang Cheng, and Weng Qing and her brother as a scribe.” </p>
<p>Mingjue’s upper lip twitched at his earlier thoughts. “Well at least that one can be out of Lotus Pier.” </p>
<p>He thought he caught sight of Jin Zixun hovering outside of the family quarters, but paid it no mind. Wei Wuxian had taken it upon himself to ward their rooms prior to the wedding, and the man was good enough at talisman work that Mingjue doubted anyone capable of bypassing them besides the immortals themselves. </p>
<p>“His first move will be much like mine,” Meng Yao whispered, apparently having made the same observation. “Searching the Unclean Realm for signs of where the dragons stay. He’ll know from my initial reports to my… to Jin Guangshan that they’re not within the walls, and will likely go further afield. Everyone should avoid the landing for now. He’s clever enough to realize the grass is tamped down.” </p>
<p>“We can pass along the message at the meal tonight.”</p>
<p>“No. He’ll insist on attending, and I believe Jin Guangshan will probably draw out his visit at least another few days to see him properly installed.” He took a steadying breath and turned to take Mingjue’s arm. “Da-ge, you should be prepared to hold your temper; my father is too aware of potential backlash if he offers you insult, so he’ll have Zixun do it in his place. He will look to get a rise out of Zixuan in punishment for his words towards me and both of you must remain calm, no matter what he says. </p>
<p>“And,” Meng Yao swallowed nervously, “Zixun will find a way to get me alone, one way or another. It won’t be as bad as when we were in Koi Tower, but he knows where and how to strike to leave no marks.”</p>
<p>Forget holding back his temper at dinner; Mingjue was already furious. “You cannot expect me to stay silent while you are abused in your own home.”</p>
<p>"We cannot give them excuses to take offense. Remember that while the House exists in the Unclean Realm, the only true alliance at the moment is between Jin and Jiang. For all his talk of alliances last night, Jin Guangshan knows that. Should something occur, he can place blame without offending his official allies, and insist on retribution. It could result in a war greater than the Sunshot Campaign."</p>
<p>"How? The Nie and the Lan would never…"</p>
<p>"No, but he could convince the smaller sects that you hold too much power, and are unafraid of offending or injuring your allies. You know many of the other sect leaders are envious of you, Xichen and your connection to the dragons. They covet that power. All it would take for that covetousness to turn to open hostility is a single excuse, and Jin Guangshan excels in finding those excuses and exploiting them. It's how he was able to avoid commitment to the Sunshot Campaign and still come ahead."</p>
<p>"I hate all this political bullshit."</p>
<p>"Fortunately you have Huaisang and I to take care of it for you." Meng Yao pressed a warm palm to Mingjue's bicep. "And we will."</p>
<p>Mingjue's upper lip twitched. "Fine. But if he does anything where I can see, Baxia and I will take exception."</p>
<p>"Of that I have no doubt," Meng Yao chuckled. "Just remember you can't actually beat a visiting member of the gentry who disciplines me for poor work as a servant of this household."</p>
<p>"A servant—!"</p>
<p>"A servant to all except those who matter." </p>
<p>Perhaps the wine, combined with exhaustion of the past few weeks and the forgone bedtime, emboldened him. "You matter, Meng Yao. To me."</p>
<p>With soft eyes and dimpled cheeks Meng Yao squeezed the arm against which his palm still rested and took himself into his room. </p>
<p>Mingjue waited outside the door for a long moment before double checking the wards Wei Wuxian had lovingly drawn into the frame, and heading to seek out his own bed.</p><hr/>
<p>Mingjue crawled in beside him shortly before Xichen gave thought to rising, sleep still pressing heavy against his eyelids and fighting the ingrained habits of a life of early mornings tugging him towards consciousness. Mingjue’s solid body tucked around Xichen's, holding tight. Xichen allowed himself an indulgent few extra minutes, which quickly turned to a quarter hour before he untangled himself from his husband's embrace. Mingjue grumbled and rolled into the spot Xichen abandoned, muttering unhappily even in sleep. Noticing the state of his hair, Xichen sighed fondly and quickly undid the tangle of braids, redoing them into something significantly simpler, which wouldn’t end up with Mingjue bemoaning the state of his head when he woke. Predictably, his husband slept through the entire affair. </p>
<p>He dressed for the day and started out, unsurprised at the empty corridors. He'd be shocked if any of the House woke before midday, and judging from the state of affairs he left behind when he took himself to bed, their guests would be in similar states of recovery. For all the indulgence, it was a wonderful evening. </p>
<p>The only exception, he thought sourly as he stepped onto the balcony overlooking the vast family gardens, happened to also be enjoying the view.</p>
<p>"Clan Leader Jin," Xichen said in greeting. "Good morning."</p>
<p>All good cheer and expansive grins, Jin Guangshan waved him forward. "Young Master Lan. Or is it Clan Leader? I'm sorry, but with your uncle conducting all your affairs…"</p>
<p>"My uncle does the Lan great honour by acting as Clan Leader. In deference and respect to his efforts, I will accept young master as a form of address." He didn't have to school this man in etiquette. He knew very well that he was speaking with an equal, but wanted the excuse for condescension. "Were you in search of something? These areas are restricted, but I am happy to assist in finding your destination." Despite Wuxian's arguments for it, they hadn't warded the hallways themselves; personal rooms could be excused away. Hallways might make it seem as though they had something to hide.</p>
<p>"No, no, just an old man's reminiscing." He gestured out to the garden, and Xichen looked down to see A-Yuan and Jingyi playing near one of the ponds. </p>
<p>His blood chilled as he considered what could have happened, if Jin Guangshan had spied A-Yuan shifting into his dragon skin. His nephew was far and beyond better at controlling it, but still not completely reliable in his efforts.</p>
<p>"I miss when Zixuan and Zixun were that age. So much energy. So much potential. Having a son is such a joy."</p>
<p>Xichen frowned. "You have more than one son, Jin Guangshan. You might take pains to remember it occasionally to absolve the rest of us of the responsibility of reminding you." It was the harshest he'd ever spoken—perhaps to anyone—but all he could think of was the  lost, confused frown when they offered Meng Yao a family; the reluctant hope when he realized they wanted nothing from him in return.</p>
<p>"His mother was a whore, Xichen, who is even to say the boy is mine?" That he could speak such horrible words while still smiling made Xichen want to take a page from Mingjue's book and rattle Shouyue in the scabbard. "But let us not quarrel. You've made a place for him here, and I'm sure he's well suited to it." Xichen only overlooked the insinuation in his tone because he had years of practice in suppressing the more violent of his emotional impulses.</p>
<p>"Meng Yao is a valued member of our house," Xichen stated coldly.</p>
<p>"You're welcome to him, Young Master Lan," Jin Guanghan stated. "Ah! But now, why don't you show me where I might find a meal. I could see my son's delicate touch in the wine served last night, but I'm not as young as I once was, and even a single jar has done my head few favours." He chuckled merrily.</p>
<p>"Follow me," Xichen said with a tilt of his head. Anything to remove him from a place where he might see the boys.</p>
<p>Behind them, A-Yuan shrieked in delight, followed quickly by the sound of a splash and Jingyi's quick, sunshine laughter.</p><hr/>
<p>Most of the guests left within the week, leaving only a few stragglers with independent business and Jin Zixun. Meng Yao fully anticipated every cutting word and comment, and accepted them with grace, fully aware that his cousin had the good sense not to say anything within hearing distance of Zixuan and thus limited in his ability to offer insult. </p>
<p>He was also limited in his ability to behave with anything resembling subterfuge. While Meng Yao now realized the House had been fully aware of his actions in sneaking about the Unclean Realm at night, it felt very different being on the other side of such matters. He’d spoken truly to Mingjue; Jin Zixun was a cruel, spiteful, ignorant bully but he was not stupid. His search did venture into some of the larger spaces within the walls, possibly because he failed to offer Meng Yao’s intelligence equal respect, but for the most part he did not repeat the efforts Meng Yao made himself upon arriving. There was something to his search Meng Yao did not care for; an erratic pattern that suggested a lack of strategy, and Jin Zixun had been on enough night hunts to know that a concentrated search pattern to be the most effective. Whatever he hoped to find, he was going about it poorly enough that Meng Yao had to wonder if they were missing something. </p>
<p>Regardless, the House had their fingers on the pulse of it, and he was much better occupied with the boys, his work with Mingjue, and—more pressingly—working on behalf of Jiang Cheng and Wen Qing to garner Madam Yu’s approval for their marriage. The Jiang Clan elder was obviously not thrilled with the idea of such a match, and Meng Yao and Nie Huaisang were tirelessly working to bring her on side. With all their efforts in finding a way to make such a match even remotely possible, they were unwilling to cede defeat now in the face of Madam Yu’s disapproval.</p>
<p>They enjoyed a brief reprieve while Jiang Cheng, Yanli-jie and Zixuan accompanied Madam Yu back to Lotus Pier. Official negotiation wouldn’t begin for another few months, at least, in respect to the timing of Yanli-jie’s wedding. They had all left early that morning, shortly after Lan Wangji and Wei Wuxian had departed to see to a request made by Wen Qing herself with a night hunt on Dafan Mountain gone awry.</p>
<p>To whit: Jin Zixun was so far from his mind as to be practically non-existent. Which meant it took Meng Yao by surprise to find himself cornered on his way back to his room from an evening meal, a rough hand on his shoulder and a sharp beam strutting out from the wall suddenly pressing into his back. </p>
<p>Despite months of tooth-aching sincerity, the habit of slipping his mask effortlessly back into place returned to him without a moment’s hesitation. </p>
<p>“You must be enjoying your time here, Meng Yao. Putting your skills to good use? On your back?” </p>
<p>“I see your odd obsession with my sexual prowess has persisted. Might I recommend developing a courting strategy of your own to allow you to focus such fixations in the appropriate direction? With the proper application of charm, you might have a chance of convincing some poor soul to have you.”</p>
<p>Shock quickly twisted quickly into rage, but instead of the blow that would have fallen at Koi Tower, he pressed hard knuckles into Meng Yao’s sternum, pressing his entire weight forward until Meng Yao could barely take a breath for the pain of it. He fought against the desire to twist his face up, meeting Jin Zixun’s eyes without blinking until his arm loosened and Meng Yao gasped in a breath. </p>
<p>“You think because you’ve gotten friendly with the Household of the Two Lords you can speak to me this way?” </p>
<p>“No. I think I can speak to you like this because if I use large words you probably won’t understand them.” </p>
<p>Jin Zixun scowled. It was a very subtle difference from the usual pinched look to his face and only obvious to those intimately acquainted with the nuances of his disdain. This time, the punch came swiftly and hammered into the same spot his knuckles had tenderized moments before. It stole the breath from Meng Yao’s lungs, and he braced for more. </p>
<p>It didn’t come. Seemingly remembering where they were, Jin Zixun pushed Meng Yao back against the wall and pulled away. </p>
<p>“The Two Lords won’t always have the corner on power, Meng Yao. You should remember that.” </p>
<p>He turned and took off. Meng Yao frowned as he went. He’d expected something similar; Jin Zixun’s ongoing failure to find anything of value meant he needed to violently express his anger instead of accepting himself as a failure. </p>
<p>So why did it feel as though they weren’t finished? </p>
<p>Meng Yao made his way back to his room, puzzling over the thought even as he struggled to take a substantial breath. He pressed his palm to the spot and wondered if the blow hadn’t bruised a rib. </p>
<p>He was three-quarters undressed when the realization hit.</p>
<p>Hastily donning his overrobe, he wound his way through the hallways and out to the houses beyond, the freestanding houses preferable in the open mountain air. He quickly found himself to where Lan Xichen and Nie Mingjue had taken up residence. </p>
<p>He knocked frantically, and after only a few moments’ hesitation, the door opened. Lan Xichen stood in the doorway, in a similar state of disarray as he prepared for bed, and frowned in concern when he saw Meng Yao. </p>
<p>“A-Yao—?”</p>
<p>“Jin Zixun knows something,” Meng Yao said. </p>
<p>Lan Xichen looked over his shoulder, scanning the surroundings for eavesdroppers, and then stepped back to allow Meng Yao inside. Before he spoke further, Lan Xichen put up a silencing barrier, finishing moments before Nie Mingjue stepped out from behind a privacy screen erected on the other side of the room, half-dressed and obviously preparing for bed. Meng Yao’s brain momentarily offered nothing but the word ‘chest’ before he blinked himself back into cognizance. </p>
<p>“What is it he knows, A-Yao?” Lan Xichen asked. </p>
<p>“I don’t know.” He shifted with a wince, which both of them immediately marked with hard glares. “He accosted me earlier. Nothing out of the ordinary, but he failed to ask me any questions about the dragons.” </p>
<p>“And you assume this means he knows something?” </p>
<p>“Undoubtedly.”</p>
<p>“All right.” Lan Xichen placed a hand on Meng Yao’s shoulder. “There’s nothing we can do about it tonight.”</p>
<p>Well, an assassination could be hastily arranged. Nie Huaisang likely wasn’t abed, and between the two of them they could suss something out. Maybe some sort of unsurvivable curse? No. he best ones took far too long, and it would cast too much suspicion on the House. It would be so much easier in Koi Tower, where everyone was always plotting and a few well-placed tugs on the threads of the golden peony tapestry could unravel someone’s life. </p>
<p>No one would miss him, either. Not even Jin Guangshan, as evidenced by his decision to leave him behind in the Unclean Realm with weak illusions as to his purpose. As he’d told Meng Yao, if he died Jin Guangshan lost nothing and despite his contempt for Meng Yao himself, he surely believed him more basically competent than Jin Zixun. </p>
<p>And yet, should Meng Yao murder someone in the Unclean Realm without the immediate need to defend his own life or the life of one of the House—even preemptively—he could not see Nie Mingjue or Lan Xichen forgiving it. And truth would out, as it always did. And he was struggling to behave as a decent person, despite the inherent conflict with his natural tendencies.</p>
<p>Deeply aggrieved, he realized he’d come to the wrong room. Now he was here, standing before two men who trusted him <em>not</em> to perpetuate wicked acts under their roof, he was reluctant to follow through on his initial and very proper impulse to see Jin Zixun dead. </p>
<p>Trying to behave in a moral way was so exhausting. </p>
<p>Tucking the assassination option back away—for now—he reluctantly nodded and prepared to return to his room. </p>
<p>“You keep touching your chest. Are you injured?” Nie Mingjue demanded. </p>
<p>“It’s nothing, Da-ge,” Meng Yao assured him. “The usual casual abuse.” Nie Mingjue’s lip curled angrily and Lan Xichen grabbed his forearm. The touch calmed him, but barely, and Meng Yao fixed him with a foreboding eye. “We knew this would happen, remember.” </p>
<p>Wrestling down the remnants of his temper, Nie Mingjue shook his head. “I told you I wouldn’t like it.” </p>
<p>“Believe me, Da-ge, I don’t enjoy it either.” He rested his hand on Lan Xichen’s, still pressed into Nie Mingjue’s forearm, a shiver running up his arm at the contact. “But I can bear it. And tomorrow I will speak with Huaisang. Between the two of us, I’m sure we can think of something that doesn’t involve murder.”</p>
<p>“Murder?” Nie Mingjue repeated with a furrowed brow. “No one said anything about murder.” </p>
<p>“Which you should consider a sign of personal growth on my part.” He allowed a teasing smile, which Nie Mingjue scowled at. “Tomorrow. I’ve kept you both from bed long enough.”</p><hr/>
<p>Before they could summon Meng Yao to speak more of Jin Zixun the following morning, their meal was interrupted by an urgent courier. The young woman looked exhausted, her spiritual energy completely depleted by what was obviously a long flight through the night.</p>
<p>"Bodies were found at the entrance to Cloud Recesses," she reported, "Horribly mutilated. Master Lan has requested aid."</p>
<p>"What do you think?" Xichen asked, after sending her to a well-deserved rest. He’d stood halfway through her declaration, mind already halfway to Cloud Recesses.</p>
<p>"Wen Xu?" Mingjue whispered.</p>
<p>"He's dead," Xichen argued. "He has to be."</p>
<p>"I didn't say he wasn't." They exchanged grim looks. "I'll let A-Sang know. We can leave right away."</p>
<p>"But with the others all gone—"</p>
<p>"He and Meng Yao are capable of handling things for the moment." His lips twisted. "No doubt they both have plans if Jin Zixun tries anything." </p>
<p>They arranged for Jin Zixun to take a tour of their training grounds, far away from the landing. The whole time, Xichen couldn't help the sinking feeling in his gut something was wrong. One of them should stay behind. But how could they? If it truly was Wen Xu returned from the dead, it had taken them both last time to defeat him, and an entity powerful enough to kill and dismember five Lan cultivators would doubtless prove even harder to stop.</p>
<p>"Be careful, Da-ge, Xichen-ge," Huaisang whispered, eyes cast with a rare glimpse of real worry. "Last time…" He turned a meaningful eye on Xichen's midriff.</p>
<p>"As careful as we can." Mingjue tugged a loose lock of Huaisang's hair. "If there's trouble, we'll do our best to come home." Even on wing Gusu was a half-day's flight, and Yunmeng still further. He didn't like the idea of them all being so far out of reach, for all he trusted Huaisang and Meng Yao to take care of things.</p>
<p>"Safe flight," Huaisang said. </p>
<p>Xichen and Mingjue both shifted and took to the skies.</p><hr/>
<p>Meng Yao had been running around all morning. First it was to find Nie Mingjue and Lan Xichen to discuss his suspicions about Jin Zixun. When he had finally been informed that urgent business had taken them to Gusu—and he needed to work on his connection to the household staff if he wasn't being immediately informed about such things—he had thrown himself into figuring out Nie Mingjue's agenda for the day to make sure nothing important was shuffled aside.</p>
<p>He had barely made headway into the horrendous pile of papers when one of the guards from the main gate crashed into the office to report an inconsolable man screaming at their door. Nothing he would generally fret over, but it happened to be one of their most prosperous farmers, one they couldn't afford to ignore lest production suffer and impact half of Qinghe.</p>
<p>The source of his vexation was his neighbour, the second most prolific farmer in Qinghe, apparently doing something obscene in his back field. </p>
<p>He had then been shown onto a horse, alongside Nie Huaisang in case he needed more weight behind words he had to speak, and was pulled out into the countryside to examine what was supposedly an attack from a neighbouring farm, but in reality ended up being a fierce corpse that had somehow stumbled onto their land and been mistaken for the neighbour.</p>
<p>The fierce corpse was easily dispatched by their honour guard. The irate neighbour, offended at the accusations leveled his way, took somewhat longer to assuage.</p>
<p>It was midafternoon by the time they finally trudged back through the gates, and Meng Yao still had a sheaf of papers thicker than his thigh to address.</p>
<p>All this fell away when he saw a familiar face strolling through the courtyard.</p>
<p>"Master Nie Jun," Meng Yao called. The man turned. "Were you not with the boys this afternoon?" </p>
<p>Nie Jun was the singularly most reliable of the boy's temporary instructors. His grasp on history was remarkably basic, and anything he didn't understand he glossed over and passed onto Meng Yao for follow up. Meng Yao loved that particular brand of subservient ignorance.  He had left instructions for Nie Jun to step in, but hadn't stayed to see them carried out. If they'd been unsupervised the entire afternoon… well. They hadn't seen smoke during their approach, so Jingyi obviously hadn't attempted to recreate his experiments with congee.</p>
<p>Nie Huaisang appeared at his elbow.</p>
<p>“I was, Master Meng. They were very spirited this morning. Missing their parents, I think.” Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji were due back from Dafan Mountain later that evening, and the boys always grew restless shortly before their parents arrived home. “I’m glad your cousin volunteered to take them for a bit.” </p>
<p>The bottom dropped from Meng Yao’s stomach. “What?” </p>
<p>Nie Jun continued with a nod, "Young Master Jin said you had given him permission to take the boys to the back training field to show them Jin sword forms. I thought it an excellent way for them to burn off the extra energy—"</p>
<p>Meng Yao and Huaisang exchanged gut-wrenching looks of panic, and took off together without another word, Meng Yao cursing his own stupidity the entire way. Of course he would go for the boys. They shouldn't have left them unsupervised, even with the pressing emergency.</p>
<p>The back field was cluttered with training paraphernalia, but exactly zero children. Forgetting himself, Meng Yao screamed, "A-Yuan! Jingyi!"</p>
<p>A muffled cry came from one of the sheds where broken weapons were stored before being melted down. Meng Yao threw the doors open and Jingyi stumbled out, bleeding from his temple.</p>
<p>"Teacher! He took A-Yuan. I tried to stop him, but he hit me, and…"</p>
<p>All the blood in Meng Yao's body rushed away, leaving him light-headed and desperate. He locked eyes with Huaisang. "I'll take him to the infirmary."</p>
<p>Huaisang adjusted his grip on his fan to grasp his white jade sword token. It glowed fiercely between his palms, but they both knew how long it would take for the others to return.</p>
<p>Huaisang jerked his head. "I'll get the horses."</p>
<p>Meng Yao hoisted Jingyi into his arms and took off at a run. Jin Zixun would have a generous start on them, but he wouldn't have been able to access the House's superior horses, and he would be riding double. There was a chance they could catch him before he made it to the border.</p>
<p>Jingyi was hysterical by the time they reached the infirmary, but he did not insist Meng Yao stay. Meng Yao pressed a quick kiss to his head, squeezed his arm, and took off towards the gates.</p>
<p>The horses were saddled and they rode out at a punishing pace. They could bring no honour guard, no additional protection; if they ended up crossing into Lanling, any sign of force would mean war, and he had no doubt Jin Guangshan would take the opportunity for what it was. Even Huaisang coming along was dangerous, but Meng Yao wasn’t going to be the one to suggest he remain at home.</p>
<p>It was nearly nightfall by the time they caught up to Jin Zixun, their horses half-dead with exertion. Meng Yao pulled wildly back on the reigns and stared in horror as they rounded a bend in the road and found themselves faced with a small army of Jin soldiers. Inside Qinghe borders.</p>
<p>"Yao-ge," Huaisang whispered.</p>
<p>Meng Yao looked into the crowd and spotted his father, Jin Zixun mounted proudly beside him. A-Yuan was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Jin Guangshan was about to emerge the winner.</p>
<p>"Nie Huaisang," Meng Yao said, turning in his saddle. "That fan really is the ugliest thing I've ever seen."</p>
<p>"I—" Before he could speak another word, Meng Yao shoved a dagger into his side. Huaisang stared at Meng Yao, face twisted up, before slumping and toppling off his horse.</p>
<p>"What, the traitor now seeks my favour?" Jin Guangshan demanded. </p>
<p>Meng Yao dismounted his horse and moved to stand over Huaisang. The other man's eyes were quickly drooping shut. "Traitor? Who do you think orchestrated things so cousin Zixun could collect the boy? Did the timing not seem perfect, with the prominent members of the House all away from the Unclean Realm?"</p>
<p>"You couldn't know we planned to drop those bodies at Cloud Recesses," Jin Zixun pointed out through a curled lip.</p>
<p>"It merely moved up plans I already had in place." Meng Yao turned and bowed deeply. “They all knew I was there on your behalf, Sect Leader Jin. It took almost the full year to be taken into their confidence. How else would I have been entrusted with the care of the children? If I had given even a hint of my true intentions, I would not have been able to be of use to you. Especially when they began intercepting my letters.”</p>
<p>Jin Zixun continued to appear unconvinced. "You never said anything!"</p>
<p>"When was I meant to tell you? You were under scrutiny from the moment you entered the Unclean Realm," Meng Yao pointed out. "And you weren't subtle about your interest.”</p>
<p>He pulled his own token off his belt and held it up for his father to see. He then very deliberately dropped it atop Huaisang's bleeding wound. "You know my capabilities, Sect Leader Jin. If I have inadvertently deceived you while at the same time deceiving them, I apologize. But please take it as a sign of my efficacy." He bowed even lower. “I know more about the Household of the Two Lords and the Unclean Realm than anyone. I’m sure my words will prove their own worth as you prepare for their arrival.” </p>
<p>Jin Guangshan's lip drew up in consideration. How could he doubt it, when all Meng Yao had ever sought was his approval? "You should call me father."</p>
<p>Meng Yao's grin widened, a nasty curl of lips cutting across his face.</p>
<p>"My son, Jin Guangyao."</p>
<p>He bowed to his father and remounted his horse, which shuddered beneath him. The soldiers passed as he trotted to Jin Guangshan's side. Behind him, tucked away in a cage mounted on a heavily reinforced wagon, A-Yuan lay unconscious in his dragon skin. His breathing was slightly laboured, but Meng Yao could see no other injuries. He’d been correct after all: Jin Zixun had known something. He’d just never suspected it to be about A-Yuan. </p>
<p>"We should hurry back to Koi Tower," Jin Zixun stated, still peering at Meng Yao with suspicion. No matter. Suspicious could be allayed, and he knew Jin Zixun well enough to find a way to set his mind at ease, especially now he was legitimized and Jin Zixun was required to treat him as family. </p>
<p>Meng Yao nodded. "I could not stop Nie Huaisang from summoning the dragons before we left. They will doubtless catch us up before too long."</p>
<p>"Home, then."</p>
<p>The soldiers preceded them, surrounding the wagon in a heavily-armoured procession to protect their prize.</p>
<p>They left Huaisang behind them, bleeding into the dirt.</p><hr/>
<p>Boiling dark clouds rolled in a thunderhead towards the white walls of Koi Tower, a massive rage-filled storm crackling with lightning strong enough to shake the marrow in his bones.</p>
<p>Jin Guangshan stood at the top of the stairs, flanked by Meng Yao and Jin Zixun. His soldiers—both cultivators and the mediocre men eager for promotion he sent out to die early—lined the steps and guarded the bottommost stairs below.</p>
<p>It felt odd, after all these years, to finally be draped in Jin gold, the coveted vermillion mark upon his brow. He'd also chosen a hat, hoping to loom as large as the man beside him.</p>
<p>They didn't have to wait long for their guests to arrive.</p>
<p>Huangang-jun landed, maw pulled back over his intimidatingly sharp teeth. Wei Wuxian, sword already drawn, glared up the stairs at the three men gathered at the top. Meng Yao understood the precariousness of their position; they had to face the Jin head on until A-Yuan was safe. </p>
<p>Chifeng-zun landed moments later, and Xichen threw himself off his back. His vaunted neutrality had disappeared in rage, Shouyue clenched tightly in his hands.</p>
<p>"Nie Mingjue couldn't join us?" Jin Guangshan demanded. "Our negotiations will be incomplete without him."</p>
<p>"Give me back my son!" Wei Wuxian screamed.</p>
<p>"A dragon? Your son? Must have been quite the surprise to your husband, Young Master Wei," Jin Guangshan guffawed. Only Jin Zixun laughed along. "But in consideration to your… feelings, I am willing to be benevolent in this instance, and allow you short visits contingent on your good behaviour."</p>
<p>Wei Wuxian’s eyes burned with such hatred Meng Yao found his own gut twisted in fear. If Jin Zixun and Jin Guangshan failed to feel it, they overestimated the chances of their own survival.</p>
<p>"Father, I'm going to go check to make sure none of the others has slipped inside the back gates," Meng Yao whispered. His father nodded and waved him away. Meng Yao ducked his head and withdrew.</p>
<p>A-Yuan was still in his cage, tucked back into the grand hall away from sight of the gathered parties. He swung around the small space in agitation, bashing himself against the bars in fruitless attempts to escape.</p>
<p>"Sect Leader Jin wants you," Meng Yao said to two of the guards. They rushed to obey, leaving only the one standing in front of the cage. He did not consider Meng Yao a threat. Why would he? After all, until now he had only been a servant and he’d been handed everything he’d ever wanted by being named Jin Guangyao.</p>
<p>"What's wrong with it?" Meng Yao asked with a frown.</p>
<p>The guard turned his head to look, which gave Meng Yao the perfect opportunity to drive the  dagger into his back.</p>
<p><em>Here and here, A-Yao,</em> his mother had said. <em>This will kill a man fast. </em>This<em> will kill a man slow.</em></p>
<p>He pushed the body away and ducked down before the cage.</p>
<p>"A-Yuan," Meng Yao gasped. The child writhed in blind panic, knocking himself against the sides of the cage. He needed to calm down, but with his eyes glazed with panic he barely seemed to see Meng Yao at all. Desperate, Meng Yao dashed his hat to the ground and frantically scrubbed the dot from his brow in case A-Yuan couldn’t recognize him through the panic. “A-Yuan.” He shoved his hands through the bars and caught A-Yuan’s snout between his palms. A-Yuan stilled and looked at him with wide, terrified eyes. Meng Yao repeated a gesture he’d seen Wei Wuxian use to comfort his son, brushing the palm of his hand along the ridge above A-Yuan’s eye. Finally, the child regained some measure of calm, though his body thrummed with the strain. </p>
<p>"You need to go to baba." There was no angle for A-Yuan to see past him. "He's through the door, at the very bottom of the stairs." A-Yuan very deliberately nodded his head, and remained calm when Meng Yao withdrew his hands. “You cannot stop once you’re out of this cage, no matter what you see or hear. Do you understand?” A-Yuan nodded again. “Be brave. Your parents are so proud of you.” Meng Yao hesitated. “And so am I.” </p>
<p>He split the skin of his thumb with his teeth and pressed it against the lock. It sprung open, and for the first time in years, Meng Yao didn't viciously hate his father's pernicious blood running through his veins.</p>
<p>He tore the cage open and A-Yuan flung himself out, flying faster than anyone could hope to catch. Meng Yao paused only to grab the downed guard’s sword before running after him. He had no hope of beating trained soldiers, but all he had to do was draw their attention. The two he’d sent off to his father were charging back, Jin Zixun close behind them, and A-Yuan flung himself above their heads. They all grabbed for him as he flew by, opening themselves for attack. Meng Yao drove the sword through one and whipped out his dagger to stab the other. His aim proved true: the man toppled over with the blade struck through his heart. </p>
<p>It left only him and Jin Zixun. He bore no illusions: he had won against the guards only because of their distraction and the element of surprise. He had no hope against Jin Zixun. For all his varied faults, his cousin was a decent fighter, and Meng Yao had effectively disarmed himself when the guards had fallen and taken his weapons with them. </p>
<p>“I knew it,” Jin Zixun spat. He swiped his sword and Meng Yao barely managed to dodge. "You fucking whore's son." His arm came springing back up and caught the cloth on Meng Yao’s arm. The heavy robes offered little protection, but they did stop the skip from being flayed open from elbow to shoulder. </p>
<p>If he ran, he might make it to one of the servant’s corridors, and had a slim hope of losing Jin Zixun in Koi Tower’s labyrinthine back passageways. His cousin never bothered with such routes, when walking the same pathways as the servants was so beneath him. But the entrance to the closest one was too far for comfort, and Meng Yao doubted he could outrun Jin Zixun over any sort of distance. </p>
<p>He threw himself backwards to put the cage between himself and Jin Zixun. The other man’s face twisted in amusement. He darted forward, arm outstretched. Meng Yao tried to twist away, but caught the blow across his chest, barely able to draw back in time to avoid being split in half. His chest lit with fire and blood filled his mouth. </p>
<p>It put Jin Zixun on odd footing and Meng Yao took the chance for what it was. He charged forward to the front of the reception hall, hand desperately pressed against the wound in his chest. If A-Yuan had escaped, and he had to make sure of it, there were other corridors he could use to hide himself away that exited at the top of the stairs. As long as A-Yuan was safe, he could retreat afterwards to see to his wound.</p><hr/>
<p>Xichen cut through the Jin guards effortlessly, skills honed through long years of war more than adequate to dispatch the collected guards. Jin Guangshan’s decision to keep them out of the Sunshot Campaign had resulted in better numbers, but untried men. The greatest of the Jin warriors, Zixuan, was back in the Unclean Realm, reluctantly remaining behind to organize their forces in case this resulted in all-out war. </p>
<p>The second-greatest was nowhere to be seen, a sharp worry Xichen ruthlessly grinding against his mind. </p>
<p>“Do you see Jin Zixun?” Xichen demanded, cutting down an approaching cultivator. The force of his blow sent the man flying. </p>
<p>“Who?” Wei Wuxian demanded, launching himself off Hanguang-jun’s back and throwing himself into a knot of men tangled up too close together and cutting through them with ease. “Oh! That one? He ducked back inside!”</p>
<p>Worrisome. Xichen didn’t like to think about what might have pulled him away. </p>
<p>A sharp tug hauled him backwards, out of the path of a blade flying towards his head. Chifeng-zun’s tail, snugly wrapped about his waist, tightened for only a moment before flinging him back into the fray. He regretted following their first inclination, to arrive upon the backs of Hanguang-jun and Chifeng-zun instead of riding in on horseback. They’d hoped the sight would intimidate Jin Guangshan into surrendering A-Yuan, but all it meant was that unless they wanted to betray their secrets, they had lost two of their best fighters in Wangji and Mingjue. </p>
<p>“A-Yuan!” Wei Wuxian screamed. Xichen cut down the man in front of him and looked up as the child barrelled into his father’s chest, Wei Wuxian catching him with ease. The moment he wrapped himself in his father’s arms he lost the ability to hold his shape, and shifted back into his human skin. </p>
<p>The sight momentarily stunned the men surrounding him, which gave Hanguang-jun enough time to grab up both Wei Wuxian and A-Yuan and take off into the night sky. </p>
<p>“Archers!” Jin Guangshan screamed, far too late. Hanguang-jun had launched them directly upwards, aiming for the stormhead where Sandu Shengshou circled above to keep the clouds in place to cover their retreat; even the best archers would be hard-pressed to hit them.  </p>
<p>That only left collecting A-Yao. </p>
<p>The moment the thought crossed his mind, movement at the top of the Koi Tower stairs caught his eye and he looked up in time to catch sight of Meng Yao, watching Hanguang-jun’s retreat with relieved eyes, blood staining the front of his robes and caught on his lips as he coughed out a laboured breath. </p>
<p>Xichen propelled himself through the air, catching hold of Chifeng-zun’s neck as the other dragon reared backwards. They could grab A-Yao, and then—</p>
<p>The blood froze in his veins as Jin Zixun appeared behind him.</p><hr/>
<p>Meng Yao stumbled forward, making it to the top of the stairs in time to see A-Yuan collide with Wuxian, his father catching him with a joyous cry of relief as he shifted from dragon to child. Hanguang-jun swept them up and shot into the air lightning fast, carrying them safely away.</p>
<p>His father turned, face twisted in rage, and Meng Yao met his eyes. Let him see that all his ambitions had been ruined by Meng Shi. Let him see his own downfall in Meng Shi’s eyes. </p>
<p>Now he had to live to enjoy watching the man suffer through the consequences. </p>
<p>Meng Yao turned to escape to one of the servant corridors, and found himself suddenly stopped by the sight of Jin Zixun standing behind him and a terrible pressure in his sternum.</p>
<p>“I wanted them to see this,” Jin Zixun told him with a smug grin. He took a step forward and the pressure increased. Meng Yao looked down and discovered Jin Zixun's sword had been stabbed right through him, intersecting the gaping wound across his chest. </p>
<p>"A-Yao!" Someone was screaming his name, but he couldn't parse the voice from the fierce roar in his ears.</p>
<p>Jin Zixun grabbed his shoulder tight and pulled him further along his blade. Meng Yao's body split as though made of paper and Jin Zixun moved his grip to Meng Yao's throat. </p>
<p>Then, with a sneer, he snapped his sword back and shoved Meng Yao down the stairs.</p>
<p>He was airborne for a short eternity, his flight powered by crushing déjà vu. He eventually hit the edge of a lower step shoulder-first, and felt something inside his body crack. His world spun as he tumbled down, time stopping for only a moment when his head slammed against marble, before the angle of his body caught his foot on something solid and he was jerked to a rough stop.</p><hr/>
<p>Chifeng-zun whipped his neck to send Xichen hurtling forward, and he landed on the step next to Meng Yao just as Jin Zixun came to a halt in front of him. He held Shuoyue aloft, waiting for the other man to make his move. The rest of the Jin troops—those Xichen and Wei Wuxian had left alive, anyway—circled Chifeng-zun on the ground below, as though they had a hope of stopping him. </p>
<p>“Stay back,” Xichen warned, though he had little hope of warning Jin Zixun off completely. </p>
<p>Jin Zixun’s feet shifted, as though preparing to strike. If he came down and put them on even ground, Xichen had the advantage of both skill and experience. Unfortunately, his would-be opponent seemed to realize it.</p>
<p>He heard Chifeng-zun launch into the air with a rush of wind and Jin Zixun looked upwards just long enough for Xichen to strike. </p>
<p>Shouyue had a long reach, and Jin Zixun screamed as Xichen ruthlessly slashed his knees. As he toppled forward, Xichen stepped to the side and flicked his blade out, opening his neck from one ear to  the next. </p>
<p>Jin Zixun toppled down the remaining stairs, tumbling to a halt upon the ground below.</p><hr/>
<p>There was so much yelling—Meng Yao wanted to look and make sure his family escaped, but he couldn't move for the pain. Surely they would go, now they had A-Yuan back? They had to.  He’d seen enough to know Wei Wuxian and Hanguang-jun were safely on their way back to the Unclean Realm.</p>
<p>A face appeared in his line of sight, and Meng Yao mustered up the energy to frown. He hadn’t expected anyone to stay once A-Yuan was free.</p>
<p>"Er-ge," he whispered. “You need to go.” </p>
<p>"A-Yao." Xichen looked panicked. Panicked and still beautiful. Was there any circumstances in which his beauty fled?</p>
<p>A sudden fear snapped through the pain to focus his clamorous thoughts. "Er-ge," Meng Yao repeated. "A-Sang—"</p>
<p>"Recovering. Your aim was perfect, and your token let us find him with time to spare. Yanli took him home."</p>
<p>"Good," Meng Yao replied. The last dregs of adrenaline fled his body and his head slumped to the left. "'S good."</p>
<p>"A-Yao," Xichen gathered him close. All around them, the sound of yelling. Of fighting. Didn’t they know they had to run? Leave him and close ranks and allow Huaisang to work his magic with the other sects before Jin Guangshan sent word and made the Two Lords out to be the villains. He never wanted to die on the Koi Tower stairs. </p>
<p>Still. </p>
<p>Maybe...</p>
<p>Maybe this wasn't so bad. To die in Xichen's arms. He only wished Mingjue was there.</p>
<p>Chifeng-zun suddenly loomed large over them, tucking his claws beneath Meng Yao and lifting him into the air, Xichen flinging himself onto the dragon’s back and holding tight. Meng Yao had never flown before; cold wind streamed past him, weightlessness buoying his flagging heart. They passed into the storm. The air temperature dropped and a sudden mist of rain blanketed him, soaking his robes with something other than blood. </p>
<p>They descended all too soon amidst trees that marked Qinghe territory. Dying in Qinghe felt far preferable to dying in Lanling. He’d found his freedom in Qinghe. Chifeng-zun eased Meng Yao to the ground and transformed back into a face Meng Yao… </p>
<p>Well. No point in fooling himself when he was dying anyway. A face Meng Yao loved. </p>
<p>He couldn’t lift his arms. </p>
<p>“A-Yao,” he whispered, grabbing Meng Yao’s hands. “Do you want to live?” </p>
<p>Meng Yao struggled to answer, his throat choked with blood. Xichen appeared on his other side and eased him over to cough it out. </p>
<p>“If I could choose,” Meng Yao finally managed to gasp out. “I would.” </p>
<p>Darkness claimed him before he knew anything more. </p>
<p>And then light. </p>
<p>Brilliant, stunning light washing through him and carried him up and out of the darkness, light the flight he’d only just experienced. He opened his eyes and looked up into the stormclouds above, only vaguely aware of Xichen and Mingjue next to him. The sky called to him, as though he could feel the storm itself strumming through his veins as though every spark of lightning echoed with the breaths in his lungs. Meng Yao stood, lifting his face to the rain and feeling every drop that touched his skin in individual pinpricks of cleansing cool. Hands slid into his, one to either side, and he looked over to take in Xichen on his right and Mingjue on his left.</p>
<p>In the midst of the storm, he spotted Sandu Shengshou circling overhead, presumably keeping watch for pursuit. </p>
<p>An ugly thought rose in his mind. “Jin Guangshan and Jin Zixun.” Jin Guangshan was still a danger to everyone until words of his actions reached the other clans. They had a chance to control the narrative, but only if they moved quickly. </p>
<p>“Jin Zixun is dead,” Mingjue stated, his face grim. “He followed you down the stairs. Xichen made sure he didn’t live long enough to regret it.”</p>
<p>Meng Yao’s shoulders slumped. The movement made his chest ache and he pressed his palm to the wound still unhealed. </p>
<p>“You will heal faster, but it won’t be immediately,” Xichen told him. “Best for us to get you home, and let you have some rest. We will deal with your father.” </p>
<p>As long as Jin Guangshan lived he would be a danger. Meng Yao and Nie Huaisang would have to step up their plans. </p>
<p>“Come, Meng Yao,” Xichen said. He shifted, and Zewu-jun appeared before him, dipping his neck in an inviting fashion. </p>
<p>“Dragons only take one rider,” Meng Yao said, casting confused eyes at Mingjue. </p>
<p>“Yes,” Mingjue agreed. “But other dragons are not riders, A-Yao. That’s entirely different.” </p>
<p>“I don’t see how.” </p>
<p>“Well, now you’ve been blooded, you’ll have sufficient time to find out.” He shifted as well, and Chifeng-zun flanked Zewu-jun, both of them waiting. </p>
<p>Meng Yao approached slowly, and Zewu-jun lowered their front leg further. As he had seen Wei Wuxian do, he carefully stepped upon the broad expanse of muscle and scales and slowly pushed himself up, his torso aching with the strain. He looped his elbow around the largest of Zewu-jun’s mighty horns and used it to leverage himself into a space upon Zewu-jun’s back. </p>
<p>Between one breath and the next, they took into the sky, rising to the stormclouds above.</p>
