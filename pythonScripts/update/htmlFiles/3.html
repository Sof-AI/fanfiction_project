    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>Tommy takes a long satisfied drag of his cigarette. It’s the last one he has, he’s been spacing them out for nightmares and bad days. Right now though, he’s treating himself. Enjoying it.</p><p> </p><p>The peace, the silence, the solitude. It’s so peaceful, so isolated, no one to disturb Tommy, only company being the flowers. Tommy laughs gently to himself. He puts his hands to his mouth, ready to take another taste and —</p><p> </p><p>Tommy is spun around to come face to face with a very angry looking Philza Minecraft.</p><p> </p><p>Tommy glances at the cigarette in his mouth.</p><p> </p><p>Oops.</p><p> </p><p>Phil’s eyes are wide but narrowed, his brows furrowed, almost looking astonished but nonetheless furious. He plucks Tommy’s cigarette out of his mouth, vanishing it into his inventory as Tommy grabs at it. Phil catches his wrist.</p><p> </p><p>“Young man.” He hisses. “Do you have <em> any idea </em> the trouble you’re in?”</p><p> </p><p>Tommy is very mature when he’s high, so he does the logical thing. He sticks his tongue out at the pissed Angel of Death as he looks over him.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah, cry about it bitch. What’re you gonna do? Not like I fucking answer to you. Go fuck off back to Techno with my hard earned cigarette, pussy. I’m enjoying the day.”</p><p> </p><p>Phil stares at Tommy for a moment before he grins. It’s.. not the nice one Tommy’s used to. “Oh sunspot, it must be hard for you, all alone. That’s my fault, so I won’t get too mad. I should’ve been more realistic. Lots of bad influences out here and no one to keep you safe.”</p><p> </p><p>Phil conjures the cigarette back, spinning it between his fingers. “I’ll even give this back if you tell me where you got it,”</p><p> </p><p>Tommy growls. “Why? You want some?”</p><p> </p><p>“Sure, sunspot.”</p><p> </p><p>Tommy blinks slowly. He’s relaxed anyways. And if he could have another drag.. sounds nice. Not like Phil’s gonna bother him more. “Quackity gives me shit for some jobs here and there. Now, gimme.”</p><p> </p><p>Tommy bats his free hand out and Phil catches that one. “Good, Toms. Good, you didn’t put up much of a fight.”</p><p> </p><p>The fucks that supposed to mean?</p><p> </p><p>“You’re in deep shit though, love. Ignoring me, betraying us, <em> smoking </em>, it was misguided to let you out of our sight for so long. We don’t need you to want to be with us, as long as you’re safe. We were wrong to assume you would be.”</p><p> </p><p>Phil strokes Tommy’s hand with his thumb. “It won’t happen again.”</p><p> </p><p>“Wha-“ Phil scoops Tommy up.</p><p> </p><p>Tommy.. he doesn’t feel like logic-ing right now. And he’s in Phil’s arms! He missed him, okay. So Tommy makes a little happy ‘mrrp’ and throws his arms around Phil for the offered hug. “Big man!” Tommy sighs, snuggling closer.</p><p> </p><p>Phil is suddenly very still.</p><p> </p><p>Tommy bonks his head against Phil’s shoulder. “Philllll, pay attention to me. C'mon, you took my cig! Philllll!”</p><p> </p><p>Phil sighs and buries his fingers in Tommy’s hair, the other circling around him to hold him firmly in his lap. “You little shit.” Phil murmurs. “Just can’t help yourself, huh?”</p><p> </p><p>“Course’, missed you a lot.” Tommy murmurs. “Missed both of you.”</p><p> </p><p>“Why didn’t you come back?” Phil squeezes Tommy. “You’re always welcome to come back.”</p><p> </p><p>“No. Kicked me out. Don’t want me. Should’ve known, saw it coming.”</p><p> </p><p>“Baby.” Phil admonishes. “You’re always wanted. Did someone tell you you aren’t?”</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah.. But it’s true. I’m annoying,” Tommy stresses. “You would’ve left me anyway. I’d have hurt you or something. Selfish too. I always want more than people can give me. And I’m boring and loud and a parasite. It’s no wonder I couldn’t save Wilber, innit? He’s been avoiding me, y'know? Probably realized how not worth his time I am. Good for him,” Tommy snorts. “He’ll be better off. You all will, soon.”</p><p> </p><p>“Soon?” Phil whispers.</p><p> </p><p>“Yeah,” Tommy confesses. “Soon. Never get to live too long, Phil. Already lost three lives.” Tommy laughs without any humor. “What's one more?”</p><p> </p><p>Tommy tightens his grip. “Hey, do you think you’ll miss me when I’m gone? Maybe just a little bit? Can you lie for me Phil? Please?”</p><p> </p><p>Phil inhales sharply, body tense. “Oh, <em> oh angel </em> , of course I’d miss you. <em> of course </em>. You won’t be leaving though, little one. I’ll make sure of it.”</p><p> </p><p>“… you’d have to protect me when he comes for me.”</p><p> </p><p>“Who?” Phil asks, all hushed tones and tight arms. “Who’s coming for my little one?”</p><p> </p><p>Tommy laughs a bit, tightens his arms too. “I can’t say it. Literally. Can’t get it past my throat. You can check my shoulder though.”</p><p> </p><p>Phil pulls Tommy away and he whines, Phil shushes him, cooing softly. “Only for a minute, baby. Then we can cuddle all you want.”</p><p> </p><p>Phil nudges Tommy’s cardigan off his shoulder, slips up his shoulder sleeve . “Let me see, be good.”</p><p> </p><p>Tommy knows Phil’s seen it when the soft summer breeze holds its breath. When the trees rustle pauses. When the world goes silent as the Angel sees.</p><p> </p><p>Phil gently peels off Tommy’s cardigan  to see his scars. Gently, feather light, he brushes a finger down one of the long pale cuts on Tommy’s arms. He checks Tommy’s other shoulder and finds nothing. He pushes Tommy’s hair back and finds a crack in his skull. He tilts Tommy’s face back and forth and finds small cuts and scars.</p><p> </p><p>“<em> When </em>?” Phil breathes.</p><p> </p><p>Tommy brushes over his arms and shoulder. “Exile.”</p><p> </p><p>He taps his finger to his skull. “A couple weeks ago, I got locked in the prison. He cracked my skull open. Brought me back. Here I am.”</p><p> </p><p>Tommy smiles, leans forward conspiratorially. “Not for long though. Won’t let him get me this time. Gonna finish the job.”</p><p> </p><p>Phil curls himself back around Tommy, let’s them fall to the bed of flowers under the clouding sky, wraps arms and wings tight around Tommy.</p><p> </p><p>“Fledgling.” Phil says in a breath not-quite human. “My fledgling.”</p><p> </p><p>The ground shakes beneath them, just slightly, before settling and then starting and then settling again. Crows gather around, settling on the branches, on the field. None of them caw, they are silent.</p><p> </p><p>They lay there for a bit, Phil processing while Tommy is lulled by his heartbeat, reaping his promised cuddles.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually, the ground calms. Phil scoops Tommy up once again, and takes flight.<br/><br/><br/></p>
