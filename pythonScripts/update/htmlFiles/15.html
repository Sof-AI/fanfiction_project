    <h2 class="toc-heading">The Worst Man for the Job</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>Lan Wangji had a son.</p>
<p>Nestled in his arms, wrapped in soft blankets stitched with GusuLan clouds, the newborn made a low whine and swatted one balled up fist in the air.  Tenderly, Lan Wangji tucked another fold of blanket around the baby so only his tiny face was left exposed to the spring air, blinking slowly in the befuddlement unique to the newly born.</p>
<p>The resemblance between father and son was remarkable.  They shared the same ethereal beauty, the line of his nose, the arch of his brow, the shape of his eyes.  There was no mistaking their relation.  At first glance, Jin Ling had to pause and acknowledge this was the most beautiful child he'd ever seen.  A child that would soon be easily melting and capturing the hearts of any who looked upon him.</p>
<p>Lan Wangji had a son, only days old.</p>
<p>
  <i>That cheating bastard.</i>
</p>
<p>Jin Ling's jaw ticked as his fist clenched over the handle of his sword.  Wei WuXian was no where to be seen.  Hadn't been seen in months.  Yet here Lan Wangji sat, content on the porch of his Jingshi, holding his love child without a care in the world.</p>
<p>The news of Lan Wangji announcing a son, an heir for Gusu, had hit the Lanling Jin court like a typhoon.  Gossip and speculation had abounded.   Jin Ling had had the worst time getting even his most loyal disciples to show the faintest speck of decorum in the rush of shouts and whispers.  Bitterly he'd regretted LanlingJin didn't have a rule against gossip like the Cloud Recesses did.  It would never stick if he tried to implement one he thought in the rush of voices, the only thought he managed to have until he could find a moment alone and really think about what he'd just heard.</p>
<p>He couldn't believe it.</p>
<p>Except...it had been an official GusuLan envoy that had delivered the news.  With a missive signed by Lan Qiren himself.  It had to be true.  Counting back the months Wei WuXian had been missing and accounting the date the child was said to be born, Jin Ling had been suddenly furious.</p>
<p>It wasn't until he was half-way to Gusu before Jin Ling thought it might not be a good idea to storm the Cloud Recesses to gut the Second Jade of Lan for being an adulterer.</p>
<p>He'd shaken his head and bulled on.  There's no sense in doing something half way, and he knew he wouldn't really rest until he saw wit his own eyes if it was true.  Could prove it wasn't true.  Because it <i>couldn't</i> be true.  He'd seen Wei WuXian and Lan Wangji together for years.  It had been obvious from the start that neither of them had any room in their heart for another.  </p>
<p>It just couldn't be true.</p>
<p>No one had received him when he arrived in the Cloud Recesses, which made him unaccountably angry.  He hadn't announced his intention to visit, so of course they wouldn't be prepared, but still.  His litt- <i>Jin Guangyao</i> had long since had the staff trained for a full range of unexpected visitors.  Even Uncle Jiang had standing orders for any visiting Sect Leader to be greeted in proper style.  Rushing forward by sword, the jade token he'd been given granting him easy access to fly above the very busy main gate below without taking notice of it, Jin Ling huffed at the empty streets he landed in.</p>
<p>It didn't matter if he wasn't greeted, he'd known the way to the Jingshi by heart anyway.  If only for how carefully he'd avoided it during his short time as a guest disciple.  He was here for answers and he would have them.</p>
<p>He hadn't expected to find his proof without even setting foot in the house.  Without even getting near it.</p>
<p>Lan Wangji had a son, really had bedded some woman and sent Wei WuXian, who loved him so dearly, away and now reveled in his new heir like he hadn't callously betrayed his husband.</p>
<p>Jin Ling's blade rang as he drew it and leveled it to point at Lan Wangji's face.</p>
<p>“Lan Wangji!  You dog!  How dare you betray Wei WuXian like this!” Jin Ling shouted, gritting his teeth as he felt the sting of tears in his eyes as the thought of how sad his unc- <i>Wei WuXian</i> must be.  “How could you?  Where even is he?  What did you do to him, huh? Wha-”</p>
<p>The door of the Jingshi snapped open and Jin Ling's voice froze in shock.</p>
<p>“Jin Ling, shut up, it's fine.” </p>
<p>“Uncle?” Jin Ling gaped at Jiang Cheng standing in the doorway with the oddest look Jin Ling had ever seen on his face.</p>
<p>Wei WuXian's familiar cackling laughter suddenly rang out from within the house.  “Hahahah!  Jin Ling really is your nephew Jiang Cheng!  Ah!  How is it possible to raise a child to be so much like you??  Ahahahahha!”</p>
<p>Uncle's head snapped around.  “Shut UP Wei WuXian!”  Turning back, he ran his hand over his face before looking squarely at Jin Ling.  “Stop bothering Hanguang-Jun.  It really is fine.”</p>
<p>“Ha!  You say that like you didn't just try to kill him too.  Aiya~ what has the world come to that people would think so lowly of my dear Lan Zhan?  Lan Zhan, do you need me to comfort you?”</p>
<p>“Wei Ying should continue to rest.” Lan Wangji said, peering into the doorway, then returning to fussing over the baby in his arms with an overabundance of naked paternal love.  Jin Ling squashed the odd surge of jealousy, then less successfully squashed the even stronger surge of horror as he realized just how he'd been threatening and yelling at <i>Hanguang-Jun</i>.</p>
<p>“So considerate, my husband.  Jin Ling!  Come in!” Wei WuXian's cheerful voice broke his growing panic.</p>
<p>Taking two steps, then pausing to awkwardly sheath his sword and give an even more awkward bow to Lan Wangji, Jin Ling edged past his uncle and slunk into the house.  </p>
<p>He'd never been in the Jingshi before.  Any visit to the Cloud Recess saw him entertained in more public areas, which was fine by him.  Though he might have been comfortable visiting Wei WuXian's home, there was nothing that could make him infringe on Lan Wangji's private rooms for something as casual as tea.  </p>
<p>Curiosity had his eyes roving over the house as he entered.  Everything was spotlessly neat and elegantly furnished.  As expected of Lan Wangji.  Over tables settled for perfect Feng Shui were neatly stacked papers covered in a messier script than Hanguang-Jun would ever use.  A few odds and ends that didn't quite match the décor were settled here and there - a strip of vivid red fabric hanging from a curl in the carved decorations on the screen dividing the room, a strangely lumpy statue of a turtle on a shelf and a box of what looked like broken parts in the corner drew his eye to the evidence Wei WuXian also lived here. </p>
<p>The room was filled with toys and blankets and enough effects to have ten infants living in utter luxury.  Every one pristine with their untouched newness.  Soft toys rested on every table and he could see a cradle, each exquisitely carved and decorated, in every visible room.  Blankets were perched here and there as if uncertain yet where they would be most at home.</p>
<p>On the other side of the room, the bedroom door was open and  he could see Wei WuXian sat up on the bed.</p>
<p>Concern replaced the lingering dread of Lan Wangji's presence at his back and Jin Ling hurried across the Jingshi.</p>
<p>Was he sick?  Was that why he'd disappeared?</p>
<p>“Hello Jin Ling, come, come!  Sit with me a bit!” Wei WuXian patted the mattress beside him.</p>
<p>Warily, darting a glance at the door and cringing to see Lan Wangji looking right at him, Jin Ling hesitantly settled on the very edge of the bed.</p>
<p>“What a good boy you are~” Wei WuXian pinching his cheek brought his attention completely back to him.  “Defending my honor so valiantly!”</p>
<p>“Hey!”</p>
<p>Wei WuXian laughed and gave him a soft, affectionate smile.  “Such a good boy.  Shijie would be proud of you.”</p>
<p>Snorting to hide the way his mouth suddenly wobbled, Jin Ling drew himself up.  “I was only defending you.  Its- You're- Anyway, that's obviously his baby, so why aren't you mad?”  He didn't remember much about his grandmother, but he did remember the poisonous way she spoke of his grandfather and his trysts. </p>
<p>“Why would I be mad?  That's my son too!”</p>
<p>Jin Ling sputtered.  “W-what?  But, you're both men!  That's impossible!”  Then did Wei WuXian cheat and Lan Wangji was the long-suffering husband?  That didn't make any more sense.  Besides, the baby still looked just like Lan Wangji!</p>
<p>Wei WuXian winked and patted his belly.  “I gave birth to him of course!”</p>
<p>Face red, Jin Ling opened his mouth to shout how utterly stupid that sounded when he took a long look at Wei WuXian.  Clean and well groomed and warmly dressed, he laid back against a mountain of pillows with a lingering air of exhaustion.  The stark white of the sheets gave color to his face in contrast, but he really was pale.  Bruises hung under his eyes, hidden at first glance by the glow of utter happiness and pride on his face.  Which, now that he was looking, was a little fuller than the last time he'd seen him.   </p>
<p>His whole aura and body seemed softer as Jin Ling swept his eyes downward.  His shoulders not filling out his sleeves quite the same way, as if he'd lost some muscle mass, and his belly.....</p>
<p>Jin Ling's mind went blank as he stared at the covered swell of his belly.  Soft and rounded.</p>
<p>Slowly he turned to look at Uncle.</p>
<p>Uncle nodded with a commiserating misery on his face.</p>
<p>“Impossible.” The word slipped from his lips, breathless.</p>
<p>“Attempt the Impossible!” Wei WuXian chirped.  “I might have married into Gusu, but I was raised in Yunmeng Jiang!  It was hard for sure, but I was determined.  And of course my Lan Zhan was ve~ry happy to help.”  Jin Ling's mind abruptly restarted in the worst way possible.  As he bent over and beat at his head to try to knock out the images that were now blooming in his mind, Wei WuXian laughed and called out to Lan Wangji.  “Bring me my Xiao-Lin.  I want him in my arms again.”</p>
<p>Lan Wangji crossed the room in a stately rush that somehow didn't jostle the child.  Jin Ling numbly got out of his way in the instinct a lifetime fearing the man had created.  Bending carefully, Lan Wangji transferred the baby to Wei WuXian's arms, then leaned back, hovering.  His hands fretfully adjusted the baby's blanket, the bedspread, the pillows.  Clearly unable to help himself, he stroked at Wei WuXian's hair and brushed his palms over his cheeks.  The very image of an anxious, doting husband and new father.  Uncertain what to do in the face of his wife recovering from childbirth, but unable to leave their side.</p>
<p>Except, he didn't have a wife.  He had husband.  Wei WuXian.  <i>A man.</i>  Wei WuXian.  Who had done some incomprehensible thing to himself to get pregnant and give birth.</p>
<p>Jin Ling watched Wei WuXian kiss the baby's head, kiss Lan Wangji, and smile wide and happy at the both of them.  Seemingly forgetting Jin Ling and Jiang Cheng were still in the room.</p>
<p>He hadn't quite processed how to feel about any of this, his expression an unconscious mirror of the one on his Uncles, when a loud clatter of shoes and stone came from outside.</p>
<p>“Hanguang-Jun!  Say it isn't so!  How could you forsake Wei WuXian and spurn his love?”  Ouyang ZiZhen's voice wailed from the courtyard.</p>
<p>“Another one.” Lan Wangji said with a flat look at the doorway.</p>
<p>Wei WuXian clearly read something from Lan Wangji's face no one else could, because he threw his head back and laughed.  There was joy and love and enough mischief in the sound that Jin Ling had the sudden clarity that the two of them had deliberately allowed Lan Qiren to initiate this misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Jin Ling looked at his Uncle, then, together, they both turned and walked out.</p>
