    <h1>No Smoking</h1>
    <div class="byline">by <a rel="author" href="http://archiveofourown.org/users/SilverWing15/pseuds/SilverWing15">SilverWing15</a></div>
      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Tommy shuts up and hunches in on himself, not daring to look Techno in the eye. "Please don't tell dad?"<br/>Techno snorts.<br/>Yeah, Tommy didn't think that would work. Okay, next shot, blatant lying. "I just wanted to try it, I've never done it before I swear. I just--Wilbur seemed to calm down when he had them and I've been--I've just not been feeling it you know?"<br/>"Tommy," Techno says slowly and deliberately, "would you like to tell me how many cigarettes you've had again?"<br/>Tommy opens his mouth<br/>"I would think very carefully about how you answer."</p><p> </p><p>OR: Tommy takes up some of Wilbur's bad habits. Unfortunately for him the arctic is a No Smoking area</p></blockquote>

      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>listen! Its technically not illegal. I started working on Remnant I am rewarding myself. Its fine. </p><p>Anyway this was inspired by a fic that Chocolateslovechild (aka Coffee) wrote the other day and its vaguely (ish?) set in her Mine to Cherish universe. You don't <i> have </i> to read that but you def should its Wonderful Coffee is such a good writer and a wonderfully nice person as well &lt;3 </p><p>anyway this is more directly inspired by a thing she wrote the other day where Phil was the one who found Tommy smoking</p><p>warnings for references to past child abuse and Tommy suggesting more abuse.<br/>Specifically hitting and being burnt by cigarettes (neither happen)</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  <i> <b> All of this is Platonic and written about the characters, not remotely the CCs. </b></i><br/>  <b> </b><br/></p></blockquote>

    <h2 class="toc-heading">No Smoking</h2>
    <div class="userstuff">
      <p>
  <span>Wilbur smoked in Pogtopia. Clouds of nicotine and ash falling through the cave like the aftermath of a volcano. At first Tommy had hated the smell, had hated that Wilbur was doing that to himself. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’d heard all of the warnings from Phil as a kid. Smoking is bad for you, it makes you sick, gives you cancer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But it also made Wilbur calm. There was less of the strung out, too thin too anxious, too shaky Wilbur when he was smoking. When he smoked he was calmer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur is gone. Well, he’s back, but he was out in the arctic with Phil and Techno for awhile. And Tommy was alone. The only part of him that  Tommy had was the box of cigarettes that once sat in the bottom of Tommy’s ender chest. He’d always made sure to have spares on hand for Wilbur, because the anxiety, the shakiness, the depression (the suicidal tendencies) had always been worse when Wilbur didn’t have any smokes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>(This box was in the bottom of the chest the day of the festival. He’d hidden them from Wilbur when he’d asked for one. He’d wanted Wilbur to go into the fight clear headed and sure. He has wondered a thousand times over if Wilbur wouldn’t have welcomed Phil’s blade into his heart if Tommy had just given him one.) </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy hadn’t really meant to start smoking them. But after Exile, after Doomsday, after that confrontation with Dream on that </span>
  <em>
    <span>fucking</span>
  </em>
  <span> mountain. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>After the prison.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>(After he died.) </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Well. They’d made Wilbur feel better. So he’d tried them too. He’s not sure they really work, but they make things easier. So every once in awhile, (its growing more frequent) he takes the box out to a field in the middle of nowhere and lights up a little bit of peace. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He takes a drag of the cigarette. The box is starting to run low. He’s going to have to get more. He’s been putting it off because he </span>
  <em>
    <span>knows</span>
  </em>
  <span> its a bad habit, but he doesn’t want to use up the last of Wilbur’s box. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s made up with his family now, but he still comes out here. He still lights up the cigarettes when the stress, the anxiety, the niggling worry that maybe they’re all just </span>
  <em>
    <span>faking</span>
  </em>
  <span> eats at him too much. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He doesn’t expect anyone to be here, why would they be? Its a random field in the middle of nowhere. And yet, a shadow falls over him. A hand reaches over his shoulder and pinches the end of the cigarette between its fingers, snuffing it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy freezes and slowly, carefully looks up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno’s eyes gleam down at him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno crouches down next to him  as slow as a glacier, as slow as a predator stalking its prey. Every part of Tommy is saying </span>
  <em>
    <span>run </span>
  </em>
  <span>but he can't move.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally Techno is at eye level with him and he finally pulls the cigarette out from between Tommy's fingers where it was nearly about to fall anyway. And he's being so quiet for so long and Tommy finally dares to whisper: "Techno?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Theseus."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Well, he doesn't sound angry. He's not yelling, not snarling, his face is still just blank. Maybe he's not that upset. Wilbur smoked in Pogtopia so maybe its fine. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So Tommy tries smiling at him, "what's uh. What's....up?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Whats up?" Techno asks. "That's what you have to say?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy looks around trying to see if maybe there's something else he should talk about.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Is that a crow?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He starts to turn but Techno snaps out a hand, fast as lightning, so fast Tommy doesn't even have time to flinch and grabs him by the chin. "What's </span>
  <em>
    <span>up,</span>
  </em>
  <span> Theseus, is that you are--once again--doing something you shouldn't be. You have--</span>
  <em>
    <span>once again</span>
  </em>
  <span>--snuck off to get into trouble."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy swallows. "Its just--its just a cig--"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno growls, low and menacing and the last time Tommy heard him </span>
  <em>
    <span>this</span>
  </em>
  <span> mad was--he doesn't even know.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Wilbur smoked too," Tommy says because every sibling knows that the best strategy when in trouble is to shove someone else under the bus.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We're not talking about Wilbur right now, runt," Techno grunts. His voice is lower, more gravely. Yeah he's pissed. Fuck he's pissed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy swallows and flicks another glance around. A distraction, an escape route--there's two crows now</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Uh," he says hesitantly, "well. Um. Anyway I've got stuff to--"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Theseus, do </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> try that."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy shuts up and hunches in on himself, not daring to look Techno in the eye. "Please don't tell dad?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno snorts.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Yeah, Tommy didn't think that would work. Okay, next shot, blatant lying. "I just wanted to try it, I've never done it before I swear. I just--Wilbur seemed to calm down when he had them and I've been--I've just not been feeling it you know?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Tommy," Techno says slowly and deliberately, "would you like to tell me how many cigarettes you've had again?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy opens his mouth</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I would think very carefully about how you answer."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shit. Fuck. Does he </span>
  <em>
    <span>know??</span>
  </em>
  <span> Tommy flicks another glance around--three crows--he usually comes out here to smoke, but he's careful to get rid of the butts. No way would Techno have waited to ambush him if he already knew Tommy was doing this. He wouldn't have needed to catch him in the act. he'd have just--done whatever he's going to do.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy calls his bluff. "This is the first one."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"The first one?" Techno asks again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy hesitates. Sometimes a half truth is better, in case Techno has some inconclusive evidence. "I tried one of Wilbur's once. In Pogtopia."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Did you now," Techno says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It isn't a question.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy nods. "I won't--I don't even like it. I won't have any more, I swear. I just wanted to try."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Oh, you didn't like it?" Techno asks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy shakes his head, "its gross."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They are gross, but the taste is worth it for the calm that floods his veins. The way his thoughts shut off, just for a little while. He can just exist focus on the taste of nicotine on his tongue and not on everything else. On what Dream has done to him, on what Dream is going to do to him when he escapes from the prison.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"See," Techno says, "its funny you say you don't like them."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy's stomach flips. He opens his mouth, but Techno steamrolls over him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Its funny you say you don't like them, because Phil's crows have been bringing back a lot of butts. At first we were confused about why. but I think I get it now"</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy flicks another glance. Five crows. Shit. Shit</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno forces him to look back at him. He leans in close and Tommy does his best to shrink away, his shoulders come up around his ears, he squeezes his eyes shut.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno's forehead rests against his. "Theseus," he says, "you are in so much fucking trouble."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy's breath hitches, his heart flutters. A cough tickles at his throat and he holds it back as long as he can but finally he has to turn away and let it out into his elbow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> It descends into a whole hacking fit, he knows Techno is watching. He can feel the weight of his eyes on him. The weight of his judgment. The fucking sword of Damocles is hanging over him and Tommy doesn't know how to get out from under it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno's hand touches his back, he flinches, but Techno only grabs him by the shoulder and forces him still while he rubs at Tommy's back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the fit subsides, his eyes are watering and his throat is sore. "Drink," Techno says, and the mouth of a bottle appears before his lips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy hesitates, but its not a potion, it looks like its just water. He sniffs at it. It smells okay.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Drink" Techno orders. "You're already in enough trouble, runt, don't push it further."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy shakily takes the bottle and drinks.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>its good, crisp and fresh, and as far as he can tell, its just water. He puts the cap back on and hesitantly offers it out to Techno. He slips it back into his inventory without a word.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy curls his knees up to his chest, wrapping his arms around his legs. "What--what are you gonna do?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno watches him carefully, his face blank, his head tilted. "What do you think I'm gonna do?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>oh gods, what </span>
  <em>
    <span>does</span>
  </em>
  <span> Tommy think he's going to do? Dream used to play this game too. Getting him to describe his own punishment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"I--forget this ever happened?" he asks with feeble hope.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno doesn't move so much as an inch. Its better that Dream's response when he tried that on him, at least. Tommy curls his arms around himself tighter.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno just keeps watching him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy shivers and looks away. There's twelve crows now. Surrounding him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>What is a punishment Techno will accept, but something that isn't as bad as it could be?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You--you're gonna tell Phil."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"That's already decided," Techno says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy flinches. That's not...that's not gonna be great.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"What do you think I should do, Tommy?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy swallows, his mouth suddenly dry. "I think you're gonna--" his breath shudders as he exhales. what's a fitting punishment? What would Dream want? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You should  make me--make me get rid of my cigarettes."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Mhm," Techno says.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"And--and you should--" Tommy curls up tighter, "you'll--" Fuck. he hates this game. hates coming up with his own punishment but he knows it will be worse if he lets Techno do it. He knows what Dream would like though. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He liked punishments--justice--to be poetic.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The first thing that comes to mind is the burning end of a cigarette pressed to his skin. Burning marks that will remind him forever of the lesson he is learning here but that-- </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shivers. He can’t--</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He doesn’t like fire. Not after the lingering smell of gunpowder and smoke as his things went down into the hole and then up in ashes. Not after the way the L’manberg flag burned, staining Manberg’s sky with soot.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Something else, there has to be something else that he can say. </span>
</p><p>
  <span> Smoking ruins your lungs, so: "You should make me run laps, until--until I can't anymore." Tommy says, his breath hitches just thinking of it. "And you should--" It feels impossible to apply the words to Techno, but he knows how the punishment game works, "You should hit me." the rest of the words come out in a rush. "Until you think I've learned my lesson."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He waits, gods let that be enough. Please nothing more than that. he's going to have to go through whatever punishment Phil has for him too.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno is silent.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There are too many crows to count now. Gathered around him, watching silently. The jury in a terrible court. Tommy waits for the word of the Judge, waits for the sentence to be handed down.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You think I should hit you." Techno's voice is unreadable.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That one was wrong. Okay. Okay. Tommy's shoulders are shaking. All of him is shaking. "I--"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno looms closer, Tommy doesn't flinch, doesn't shy away, he shuts his eyes and waits.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The touch is gentle, a hand brushing over his hair. "This," Techno says, "this is why you're in trouble. Not because you're smoking, that's only a symptom, runt. This is the heart of the problem, isn't it? You've forgotten."</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno takes his wrist in one hand, gently tugs Tommy's fingers loose from their deathgrip on his pants. "Look at you. You're too thin. Your hair is a mess, you have bags under your eyes. You've forgotten that you have to take care of yourself. You've forgotten that you are precious. Do you know what I'm actually going to do, Tommy?"</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mutely, Tommy shakes his head. Techno's words are bouncing around in his head but they're just meaningless noise. They don't make sense.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno leans even closer. "I'm going to take you home," Techno says. "And I am going to take away your cigarettes. You don't get to do that to yourself. You don't get to starve yourself either, so I'm going to get you back on a good diet. </span>
  <span>You don't get to deprive yourself of sleep, so you're going to sleep in my bed with me. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“That </span>
  </em>
  <span>is what I am going to do, runt. And then I'm going to find whoever put the thought in your head that </span>
  <em>
    <span>anyone</span>
  </em>
  <span> should </span>
  <em>
    <span>ever</span>
  </em>
  <span> hit you, and I'm going to kill them. And I'm going to take my time with it."</span>
