<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>Techno doesn’t subscribe to a lot of social norms. The majority of them are little things. Like average meal and bed times. His schedule is hectic, things can change in a moment, and his work can take time, he needs to be flexible. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sometimes he’s up at 2 AM for a quesadilla and that’s just where his life has led him. But this time when he’s up at 2 AM for a quesadilla the fridge is open and there is a person covered in blood in his house staring at him as they drink his milk straight out of the carton. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now, a person being covered in blood in his house isn’t exactly</span>
  <em>
    <span> odd.</span>
  </em>
  <span> One of those pesky little societal norms that Techno doesn’t really subscribe to. There are a lot of people who come into his house and end up covered in blood. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>This isn’t one of those people.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Or, well, he is a person, covered in blood and he’s in Techno’s house, but Techno didn’t do that to him. Which is odd. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s a kid, Techno registers suddenly. A kid covered in blood in his kitchen at 2 AM drinking milk straight from the carton when all he wants is a quesadilla. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fuck. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kid is staring at him, eyes wide, hand slackening around the milk carton. His breath is shallow and shaky--broken ribs, Techno’s familiar with the sound--blood is making a trail down his face from a gash on his forehead. He’s hunched over himself, pain tightening his features. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>This is a kid that’s been through some shit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The milk carton slips out of his fingers and drops onto the floor. It tips over, spilling a pool of white onto Techno’s tile. It turns pink as it hits the kid’s feet. More blood. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bruh.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kid screeches and tries to bolt. He slips in the blood and milk and goes down, wheezing and curling in on himself. Shit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno takes a step forward. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck off! Don’t fucking touch me you bastard!” the kid snarls, scrabbling at the floor, trying to get up, trying to move. He’s mostly just spreading the milk everywhere. He kicks the fridge and a couple condiments and a jar of pickles fall out of the door. The jar shatters and bits of glass go spinning across Techno’s kitchen. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kid’s been here for thirty seconds and he’s already wrecking shit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Quit that!” Techno snaps, “you’re not getting anywhere just chill out.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kid scrambles back, managing to get to the wall. He tries to pull himself up on it but instead he just manages to get pickle glass in his foot. He yelps and goes down again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The door of the fridge swings shut, plunging them into darkness. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The moon shines through the kitchen window, but the kid is out of its light, the only evidence that he’s still in the room is harsh, raspy breathing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno sighs. He just wanted a quesadilla. He carefully steps to the light switch and flicks it up. The kid flinches at the sudden light. Its not doing him favors, he’s worryingly skinny, bags under his eyes that blend in with the bruises around them. His shirt is dirty and torn and Techno can see now that most of the blood is concentrated on his right flank. There’s another patch on his left shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kid is white, blond, blue eyes, young, probably came from the street. Its a familiar list of traits. One that makes Techno pretty confident he knows what hell the kid escaped from. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno sighs again, “alright kid, let's get you fixed up and then we’ll call the cops.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No!” the boy shouts. He lunges across the room like he’s gonna tackle Techno even though he definitely outweighs him by at </span>
  <em>
    <span>least </span>
  </em>
  <span>a hundred pounds. “You can’t!” the kid wails, “you can’t, you can’t, he’ll find me. He’s gonna--you can’t. Please, please I’ll leave, just don’t--don’t call them.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His breath is coming fast and shallow--harsh against the ribs probably--panic attack. Shit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno grabs the kid as gently as he can and carries him out of the kitchen. He puts up a token struggle but he’s a bit occupied with the panic attack and the pain, its easy enough to dump  him (gently) on the couch--its got a cover, it’ll be fine, Techno knows how to get blood out of stuff. The kid immediately tries to get back up again, but Techno pins him by the shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright, I won’t call them alright? You’re hurting yourself, just calm down. I’m not going to hurt you, I’m trying to help.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil would be much better at this. So much better. Gods he wishes Phil had stayed the night, but he wanted to hang out with his wife or whatever so he’d gone back to his own apartment. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ugh. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Here, put your head between your knees.” He manhandles the kid a bit and shoves his head down. He gets a muffled squeak of protest but not much resistance. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Slowly, the kid’s breaths even out a bit, slowing down, steadying. Techno cautiously removes his hand from the back of his neck. His head pops up like a fucking whack-a-mole, staring at Techno with wide blue eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He likes the ones with blue eyes. Not Techno, Techno doesn’t really give a shit about eye color. The other guy. He’s got a thing about blue eyed blond kids living out on the street. Its a pretty narrow set of criteria, you wouldn’t think there’d be a lot of them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There certainly isn’t now.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Take it easy,” Techno tells the kid, he’s either the first one that’s managed to escape, or he was let go as some sort of challenge. Or gift maybe. Something. The other guy is kind of completely insane; he's hard to figure out. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>If the kid was intentionally let go, that’s bad news. Techno needs to get on top of that shit. But even </span>
  <em>
    <span>he’s</span>
  </em>
  <span> not so bad at social situations that he’ll go straight to interrogating the kid who just had a panic attack. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno isn’t a small guy. He’s not a harmless looking guy. But he does his best. He folds down, forearms on his knees, sitting beside the kid, not staring directly at him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You alright?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck off,” the kid snarls breathlessly. A spitfire, isn’t he? Maybe he had escaped after all. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Take your time, nothing bad is gonna happen,” Techno says as gently as he can. He’s not...</span>
  <em>
    <span>made</span>
  </em>
  <span> for gentle. This is really more of a Phil thing. But Phil isn’t here. Damn it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kid shudders, then hisses and puts a hand to his side. They probably need to deal with that, but Techno can give him a couple more seconds. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My name’s Techno,” he says quietly. “You’re in my house, you’re safe here. I promise, nobody’s getting through that door unless I let them in.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>I</span>
  </em>
  <span> got in through that door, fuckface,” the kid snarls. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah well I was passed out, I’m awake now. Nobody’s gonna hurt you. If you don’t want me to call the cops--” The kid jerks up with wide, frantic eyes “--I won’t. But you’ve got to let me look at that.” Techno motions with his head towards the blood stain on the kid’s side. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re bleeding.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mind your fucking business. I already took care of it.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno glances to the coffee table and sees that his first aid kit is already open and Phil’s careful organization is scattered across the livingroom. Damn it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno can give the kid a pass since he was probably panicked and doing it in the dark. But that does mean that whatever treatment he’d done was while he was panicking and in the dark. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want to make sure you did it right,” Techno says, but he still doesn’t make a move towards the kid. He’s watching Techno like a hawk, tense as a drawn bowstring, faint tremors shaking his hands. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s had one hell of a night, but it isn’t over yet. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on,” Techno says, “I promise I won’t hurt you kid. I just don’t want you to bleed out on my couch, alright? Just lift up your shirt and let me see. Maybe I won’t even have to do anything.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Highly unlikely, but its not like </span>
  <em>
    <span>lying</span>
  </em>
  <span> is some sacred moral line that Techno won’t cross. He’s done much worse than lie. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kid fiddles with the ragged hem of his t-shirt, gnawing at his lip. Techno waits, silent, patient. Finally, a few inches of pale, bruised skin are exposed. Then a few more. And then the tan of ace bandages, startlingly dark against the kid’s skin. Wrapped so tight that they’re digging into his belly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They’re also already soaked with blood. Since they’re, you know, supposed to be like. Wrapped around a sprained ankle and not a stab wound. There’s also what looks like fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>band-aids</span>
  </em>
  <span> being used as improvised stitches. Yeah, no, Techno’s gonna have to take care of that. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Slowly, he shifts, “alright, I’m gonna take a look.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck you!” the kid snaps--Techno would wonder if that’s the </span>
  <em>
    <span>only</span>
  </em>
  <span> thing he can say if not for the few outlier words he’s thrown in--and he shoves his shirt back down. He tries to scoot away, but he’s running low on adrenaline, he’s not breaking any speed records. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno catches him easily enough, but then he’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>caught</span>
  </em>
  <span> the brat who got away from the smiley fucker and he very quickly figures out why. He gets a string of screeched curses, a fist flung haphazardly into his shoulder, fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>teeth</span>
  </em>
  <span> snapping far too close to his face for comfort. The kid’s fucking rabid. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Its the sort of fighting you’d expect to get off a street kid. A burst of violence to deter attackers looking for an easy target. Techno is more persistent than them and the kid is already tired. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He catches the thin wrists in one hand, pins the kid’s legs under his knee, shoves him down onto the couch. “Stop,” he snaps, maybe a bit more sternly than is reassuring, but fuck, the kid’s got some sharp nails that he just slashed down Techno’s arm. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck you!” the kid slams his head into Techno’s elbow. It knocks him just slightly off balance and the kid takes that as a chance to buck, getting one leg out from under Techno’s and sending it straight into his gut. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fucking brat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno is used to fighting this sort of desperate battle with fully grown fully healthy adults, one half-dead teenager isn’t going to beat him. He’s doing better at it than some of those adults though, damn. They were soft and spoiled, used to preying on the weak and helpless with words and policies and blackmail. They weren't used to being preyed on by someone beyond their petty rules, and that was the end of them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not the kid though, the kid's a fighter and damn is he not going to go quiet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m trying to help you,” Techno snarls, grabbing the free ankle as it makes a go for a below the belt hit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno sighs.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kid snarls wordlessly, twisting in a way that makes him cry out. Fuck, he’s going to hurt himself more than Techno at this rate. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno makes the executive decision that this fight is over and then he flattens the kid. No finesse, no fight, just a full body flop onto a wounded teenager at 2 AM. This is his life now. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He just wanted a goddamn quesadilla. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stop,” Techno snarls, their faces are close, he hopes he isn’t about to get his nose bitten off but there’s a feral light in the kid’s eyes that doesn’t bode well for that. “Just stop,” he says a bit softer, feral he can work with, animal he can work with. He’s good with animals. They’re easier than people, that’s for fucking sure. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Easy,” Techno says, low and gentle. A person’s just an animal with a few more complicated habits. He’s just dealing with a scared animal, fighting to survive. “Take it easy, you’re alright.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A tiny whimper fights its way out of the kid’s throat. His eyes are shining with tears. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ah shit. Now Techno feels kind of bad. The kid’s had one hell of a fucking night. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then the little shit lunges and slams their heads together. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno no longer feels bad. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>With a growl he pins the kid, wrists to his chest, ankles pinned between Techno’s side and the back of the couch. He gets a rusty wail, desperate and hopeless, and a feeble wiggle. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Calm,” Techno says, “I just need to look at this kid, you’re alright.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kid buries his face in the arm of the couch. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Good enough. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno has one free hand, which is gonna make this difficult, but he’s not risking letting the kid go. He’s a tenacious little fucker, which Techno admires, but he would admire it a bit more if the kid wasn’t attacking him like a rabid raccoon. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He uses his free hand to fumble around in the debris of the first-aid kit explosion and finally comes up with the scissors. Even though they’re emergency scissors, blunted, made only for cutting cloth, and not in any way (alright maybe a few ways if you’re creative) capable of stabbing people, the kid takes one look at them and starts panicking again. He wiggles ineffectively, trying to get his legs free from Techno’s side with a desperate whine. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, stop, I’m not--” he grunts, “--I’m not stabbing you with the scissors, calm down.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fucking--fuck you! Fuck you! You fucking bastard, bitch, dickhead!” the words are stuttered and stumbled and the kid is shaking and trying to fight but he’s really not getting very far with it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stop,” Techno says sternly, “just stop. You’re just exhausting yourself and making this harder than it needs to be.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A wordless snarl.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Looks like they’re doing this the hard way all the way through, then. Great. Techno shoves himself further onto the couch, forcing the kid’s legs against the back cushions and firms his grip on his wrists. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The ace bandages fall away with a few cuts of the scissors and Techno sets them aside. “There, see? Didn’t stab you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fucker.” The word is a bit slurred, less vicious and more tired. Kid’s in for one hell of an adrenaline crash any minute now, there’s no way he can keep this up. Techno turns to the wound. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The band-aid stitches have, obviously, not held in the least. The wound is fairly small, doesn’t look terribly deep. The kid was lucky in more ways than one. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Its not too bad,” Techno tells him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I got fuckin’ stabbed.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not fatally,” Techno says, “you’ll be alright. Might not even need stitches.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kid’s eyes water at the thought, even though he’s clearly trying to hide the fact. He’s scared, and in pain, and probably fucking exhausted, but they're not done yet. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m gonna clean it out,” Techno says, “I’d like both hands for that. If I let you go, are you gonna be an idiot and try to attack me?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kid snarls wordlessly, “you--” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno only looks at him, flat and calm. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kid looks away, shoulders tight, wrists twitching in Techno’s grip. “No. You can let me go.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno looks at him for another second, “if you attack me, I’m tying you up.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A shudder. Techno nearly winces, yeah alright, threatening to tie up the almost-murder victim might not be the </span>
  <em>
    <span>best</span>
  </em>
  <span> idea. But oh well, the words are out now, can’t pull them out of the air. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m just trying to help, kid, I can’t do that if you beat the shit out of me.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kid closes his eyes, “like I could fucking beat you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You got away from the other guy,” Techno says, even though the kid is completely correct and he could not beat Techno in a fight. Not in this state, not even with adrenaline and desperation on his side. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kid doesn’t answer, pressing his lips together and turning his head aside. Slowly, Techno lets go of his wrists. They’re probably gonna have a new layer of bruises on them but the kid isn’t gonna bleed out. You win some, you lose some. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kid doesn’t immediately leap to clawing at him again, a good sign. Alright. Techno can do this. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m gonna pour some rubbing alcohol on a rag and try to clean it out as much as I can.” He informs the kid, “its gonna hurt like a bitch and there isn’t really much I can do about that, sorry.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kid clenches his jaw and nods. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll get it over with as quickly as possible, alright?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Another silent nod. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The silence doesn’t last. The kid is exhausted, weak with blood loss and adrenaline crash, and his voice is damn near blown out, but he manages a hoarse cry as the first touch of alcohol hits the wound. Then he’s quiet, tears slipping down his cheeks as he lays tense beneath Techno’s hands. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He doesn’t pass out, even though he’s probably only managing that on sheer determination. He’s a fighter, that’s good. Techno wipes the blood up from around the wound and dries it so the bandages will stick better. “I’m gonna put some butterfly bandages on this,” he says, “you have to be careful otherwise they’ll pop off and we’ll be right back here, alright?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It takes a minute for the kid to nod. Like he’s got lag in the connection between his brain and his ears. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Almost done,” Techno reassures him, “and then you can sleep.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A shake of the kid’s head. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, you’re gonna rest,” Techno tells him, “you need it. You’ll be safe here, I promise. I’ll keep watch.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A furrowed brow, lips in a frown, blue eyes watch him unhappily, half closed. It looks more like a pout than the glare Techno assumes the kid is going for. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s kind of cute when he’s not being all feral and bitey. Phil’s gonna love him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno puts more butterfly bandages than are probably needed on the cut but, well. The kid’s probably gonna try and bolt the minute he can stand. Before then, even. He’s gonna need the extra on there when he has to wrestle the little brat down again to change the bandages. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kid barely mumbles a protest when Techno has to disturb him to wrap a bit of gauze around the wound. He’s out like a light by the time Techno gently lays a blanket over him. He’s got other injuries but Techno’s willing to wait on those for a bit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The way he’s sleeping, Techno bets he’ll be out for hours before he even moves. When he does he’ll probably wake himself up with the pain, but there’s a fifty-fifty shot he’ll just go right the fuck back to sleep. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s time, then. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno cleans up the bloodied bandages--he’ll get the couch later, he’s not disturbing the kid even if he’d probably sleep through it--and puts the first aid kit into some semblance of order. Then he steps away from the couch and goes back upstairs to get his phone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s an email waiting for him on the lock screen. Email address unknown, the subject is a smiley face. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno grits his teeth and opens it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Its the usual drivel, poetically worded whinging about the state of the world, desperate attempts to gain Techno’s attention, Techno can practically imagine the guy drooling at the mouth at the thought of Techno reading the damn email. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Wolves are stronger when they hunt in a pack, no? </span>
  </em>
  <span> Techno rolls his eyes and nearly doesn’t bother reading the rest, but then he catches on one word. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Gift.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His focus zeroes back in on the email. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kid didn’t escape, he was let go. In Techno’s territory, practically on top of Techno’s house. He was supposed to be </span>
  <em>
    <span>grateful</span>
  </em>
  <span> for the little brat in his house, bleeding out and spilling his milk. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ah, dang, he’s gotta clean that up too, he’d nearly forgotten. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And after that, he’s going to find the smiley bastard and tear him limb from limb. This shit has gone on long enough, its gone too far. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The asshole had sent the kid in here, let him think he’d escaped, that he was gonna live, only to get murdered. He’d expected Techno to see a scared, bleeding kid in his house and be </span>
  <em>
    <span>grateful.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Like Techno was going to kill an innocent.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That’s not who he is, that’s not who he kills. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>For all Smiley thinks that they are the same, a harmony, two wolves attacking a flock, they couldn’t be more different. If Techno’s gonna kill anyone, its Smiley. Techno isn’t a wolf, he’s here to protect people, its just that sometimes that means killing the corrupt fuckers untouchable by the law. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And he knows just the guy who’s gonna help him figure out where Dream is. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno flicks away from the email and opens up his phone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil’s number is at the top of his contacts, its practically his </span>
  <em>
    <span>only</span>
  </em>
  <span> contact. The phone rings out once, but Phil picks up on the first ring the second time Techno calls. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Whazzit?” his voice is still thick with sleep over the line. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My place,” Techno says shortly, “bring painkillers, the strongest you can get your hands on.” He nearly hangs up immediately, but then he reconsiders and puts the phone back to his ear. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“--at? Techno? Are you okay??” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m fine, they’re not for me.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now he does hang up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kristin is gonna be out for blood for getting Phil up this early, but Techno will stop at Niki’s and get some offerings next time he’s on his way over. Maybe then he’ll be able to at least get in the door before her wrath is unleashed on him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Plus he’s getting them a new kid to dote on, surely that’ll make up for it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He grabs a book as he goes back downstairs, he’s gonna be up for awhile, may as well get some reading in. The kid is still sleeping like the dead when he gets back--Techno checks his pulse to make sure he’s not sleeping </span>
  <em>
    <span>too much</span>
  </em>
  <span> like the dead, but he’s still alive. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil bursts in a bit later, still in sweats and a tank top, his feet jammed into what Techno is pretty sure are Kristin’s sneakers, a pharmacy bag rattling on his wrist. “What happened?” he demands. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shh,” Techno scolds, “you’ll wake him up.” He motions to the couch and Phil squints at him, but he does stay quiet as he kicks off Kristin’s shoes and comes closer. Techno can see the minute he registers what’s on the couch. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His face stops looking like he bit into something sour and more like he just saw a puppy. “Mate,” he breathes, “ who’s this?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Not sure,” Techno says, “didn’t get a name, was more focused on making sure he didn’t bleed out.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil sits on the edge of the coffee table, handing over the bag distractedly. “Oh he looks so--” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He looks like shit,” Techno says, “but he’s not gonna die.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where’d he come from?” Gently, carefully, Phil brushes the kid’s bangs out of his eyes, he makes a wounded noise low in his throat when he sees the gash on his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Smiley,” Techno growls, “apparently he’s a </span>
  <em>
    <span>gift.</span>
  </em>
  <span>” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil isn’t an angry guy, he’s pretty mild, all things considered. More likely to laugh at something rather than worry about it. Techno hasn’t seen him angry much, Phil </span>
  <em>
    <span>gets</span>
  </em>
  <span> angry, sure, but he doesn’t show it unless he </span>
  <em>
    <span>means it.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He means it now. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil leans forward and pulls the kid’s shirt down off his shoulder. Under the bloody patch is a smiley face, carved right into the skin of his shoulder like a brand. Phil takes a shaky breath. “Well,” he says, his voice full of quiet menace, “we’ll just have to show him how much we </span>
  <em>
    <span>appreciate</span>
  </em>
  <span> the thought.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno grins, “I was hoping you’d say that.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil smiles back, all bared teeth and bloodlust. Then he shuts that part of himself away. “Later. For now, let’s get this kid some painkillers.” Gently, he traces the furrowed line of the kid’s brow, the pained expression that lingers even in his sleep. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey mate,” he says softly, “wake up for a second okay? Techno, go grab him some water to take these with.” He pulls a bottle out of the bag, “he’s really fucking skinny but I think we’ll risk a pretty big dose. Once we’re ahead of it a bit we can back off on the painkillers.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno grunts and obeys, shuffling into the kitchen. Ah shit, the milk. He’ll get that in a second. He grabs a cup from the cabinet and fills it with a bit of tap water. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Careful,” he advises Phil, “he’s a fighter.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil smiles, soft and warm and charmed, “of course he is. Come on mate, let me see those eyes.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kid whines softly, eyes scrunching tightly shut. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know its bright,” Phil croons, “I’m sorry, we’ll turn the lights down.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>By which he means </span>
  <em>
    <span>Techno</span>
  </em>
  <span> will turn the lights down, because there’s no way anything less than Kristin herself is pulling him from the kid’s side. Techno rolls his eyes fondly and turns off the overhead, leaving only the lamp by the couch on. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He returns to Phil’s side just in time to see the kid crack open an eye. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil gasps like he’s just seen a miracle and fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>melts,</span>
  </em>
  <span> “there’s those baby blues. I’ve got some painkillers here for you, they’re pretty big so Techno brought you some water.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He gets a confused blink, Techno can practically see the buffering wheel trying to go around in the kid’s head. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Open your mouth,” Phil coos and the kid is woozy enough that he obeys without a fuss. Phil drops the pills on his tongue and follows them up with a bit of water. “Swallow, don’t chew.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The pills go down, but the kid coughs a bit. He hisses in through his teeth, whining pitifully and clutching at his ribs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh mate,” Phil says sympathetically, “its alright, those’ll help.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kid squints at him again, the cogs are desperately trying to turn in his head, Techno can see them. They’ve gotten rattled around a lot tonight, its taking them a bit to get into gear. The kid’s eyes slide shut and then he drags them back open. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wh?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil smiles, “Hi mate,” he whispers softly, like he’s trying not to spook an animal. “I’m Phil, I’m Techno’s friend. He called me to come help you. I’m with the police.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ah shit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Phil--” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kid’s eyes widen, “no,” he moans, “no, you--you prom’s’d.” He’s trying to figure himself out enough to move but his limbs are apparently a bit confusing at the moment since he’s just kind of feebly twitching one leg. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Calm down,” Techno says, “Phil’s a friend, I trust him with my life. He’s not gonna turn you in or anything. Nobody but him is here and he’d never hurt you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kid whines wordlessly, a tear slips down his cheek. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh mate,” Phil croons, “its alright, I promise I won’t do anything, you’re safe with me and Techno. Safer than anywhere else in the world alright? We’ll protect you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kid looks hazy but definitely not convinced. He searches for Techno and manages to focus in his general vicinity, “you promised.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Technically Phil isn’t a cop, he’s a detective,” Techno says, not really feeling all that bad about it. Sure the kid’s scared but when he’s not being intentionally </span>
  <em>
    <span>scary</span>
  </em>
  <span> its kind of hard to stay scared of Phil. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s tricky like that,” Phil confides to the kid, “I always get onto him about eating and he’s always got some technicality to try and justify it with. You should hear the potato rant.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“A baked potato with dairy is a complete diet, Phil,” Techno says, its a well worn argument, practically a call and response by now. “It contains all of the nutrients necessary for human life.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That is a myth and you </span>
  <em>
    <span>know it</span>
  </em>
  <span> you little shit,” Phil says, pointing a stern finger at him. He turns to the kid, “see what I’ve got to put up with,” he’s smiling, inviting some audience participation in the Phil and Techno Show. The kid blinks at him, long and slow.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And he’s back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno can’t help a little smile, he’s a scrappy little shit. The kid scowls at him for his trouble. “What’d you fuckin’ give me?” he slurs, “you drugged me.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It was just some painkillers mate,” Phil reassures him. “Look, I’ve got the bottle right here, and the plastic that came off the lid too. They were sealed.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kid stares at the bottle and plastic like they’re a high level math equation. Techno wonders if he doesn’t have a bit of a concussion. Then again, drugs and blood loss can do that to you too. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck you,” the kid eventually decides, shutting his eyes and turning his head away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright mate,” Phil says agreeably. “You wanna tell me your name before you go back to sleep?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A long moment of silence, so long that Techno almost thinks that the kid’s conked out again, then faintly: “S’Tommy.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil smiles, “hi Tommy.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He gets a grunt, and then the last bits of tension drain out of the kid’s shoulders. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil brushes his hair back again, “he’s precious,” he says, “how could anyone ever--” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s insane,” Techno reminds him. “You wanna see the message?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil silently holds his hand out for the phone and Techno hands it over. “Keep an eye on him, I have to clean up my kitchen.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>*** </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kid wakes up a couple times in the night, but for the most part he’s out. Kristin calls when she wakes up alone and Techno manages to avoid getting scolded for stealing her husband when he offers her pictures of their new kid. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Predictably, she, like Phil, is a melted gooey mess of ‘awww’s and ‘sweet baby’s the minute she lays eyes on him. This is why Techno doesn’t bother with being good at kids. Phil and Kristin can handle that, he’ll just stab people. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil takes over Techno’s kitchen (now clean, though it smells a little bit like pickles and sour milk) and makes breakfast for them. The scent rouses the kid and predictably, he tries to get off the goddamn couch. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah ah!” Techno scolds the minute his feet hit carpet, “back on there.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kid is a bit more there now, he manages an actual glare instead of a vaguely pouty stare. Its still kind of cute. “Fuck you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>That’s his favorite phrase, Techno thinks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I told you you have to be careful with those bandages,” Techno says, “no escape attempts.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe I have to pee, did you think of that, bitch boy?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then I’ll walk you to the bathroom, or Phil can,” Techno motions over his shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kid blinks at Phil like he didn’t think he was actually real. He gets a warm “hi mate. You need some help?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, fuck off.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ooh, fuck </span>
  <em>
    <span>off </span>
  </em>
  <span>this time, he’s expanding his vocabulary. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy watches them with a wary glare, hovering between lying down and pushing himself up. Techno waits. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He stands. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Unwise. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He goes down almost immediately and Techno has to catch him before he brains himself on the coffee table. That’d be a shame, escape from an entire serial killer just to get offed by furniture. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kid flinches and tries to punch him, but Techno doesn’t even bother acknowledging it, he just sets him gently back on the couch. “Don’t try that again.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck you!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The little shit shoves his hands away, snapping his teeth like he’s gonna try and bite a finger off before curling up into the corner of the couch. Techno backs away, its early and the kid is already prickly as a fucking cactus. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>To be fair, it was pretty late when he got in. Its probably only five or so hours since he nearly got murdered. That’s bound to make anyone testy in the morning. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You want some more pain killers?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not letting you drug me again,” Tommy snarls, baring his teeth. Techno doesn’t push, he knows the kid probably would actually bite him. They’ll just crush up a couple pills in his breakfast. Like you do with dogs. Techno’s pretty sure he’s got some peanut butter around. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil gives him a look across the room like he knows exactly what he’s thinking. Its only a little bit disapproving. The kid’s breakfast ends up being a bit more grainy than theirs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not that the kid notices. He scarfs it down like its the first food he’s seen in months. Phil watches him with quiet sadness, and lets him scrape the plate clean before he takes it away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So,” he says when he returns, sitting at the far end of the couch, mirroring Techno’s position from last night. Folded in, small and harmless. “You wanna tell me about what happened?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy eyes him warily and he shakes his head. He’s gone quiet again, blinking longer. His exhaustion is catching up to him fast and the pills are already taking the edge off of the pain that’s keeping him up.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No?” Phil asks softly, “you sure? I’d like to help you mate.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy shakes his head again, curling in on himself more. “He--” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He bites his lip. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can tell me,” Phil coaxes, soft and sweet, “I won’t tell anyone.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s not even lying. No need to get any actual cops involved in this. They’ll handle Smiley themselves. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy whines, conflicted and confused. He’s leaning towards Phil, but still cowering in on himself. Like he’s expecting a blow. Phil gently brushes his hair away from his eyes again, tilting the kid’s chin up with butterfly-soft touches. “Its alright mate,” he croons, “I won’t hurt you. You don’t have to talk if you don’t want to. You can go to sleep if you’re tired, we’ll keep an eye on you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy’s eating it up, the touches, the gentle words. For all he’s defensive and prickly and completely willing to hurt someone he thinks is gonna hurt him, he’s still a kid. Just a kid who got hurt and now he’s desperate for some tender love and care, Phil’s always had plenty to give. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil scoots closer carefully, arm held out in invitation and Tommy barely lets him sit down before he’s leaning against his side. Phil looks like he was just declared the chosen one by some divine force. He even flicks his eyes to Techno as if to ask ‘</span>
  <em>
    <span>did you see??’</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’ll be no living with him after this. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s going to be </span>
  <em>
    <span>insufferable.</span>
  </em>
  <span> For </span>
  <em>
    <span>weeks.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil wraps his arm around Tommy’s shoulders and rests his chin on top of his head. “I’ve got you mate,” he croons, “safe and sound, you don’t need to worry about him.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy nods kind of uncertainly, like he’s not really getting what it is he’s agreeing to but as long as Phil keeps holding him he’s alright with whatever it is. Phil coos wordlessly, petting his hair and gently scratching at his scalp. Tommy </span>
  <em>
    <span>melts,</span>
  </em>
  <span> he’d probably eat out of Phil’s hand at this point. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You wanna tell me about who did this to you?” Phil asks, soft and sweet. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“‘w’sa p’lice officer,” Tommy mutters vaguely. “ Had ‘lond hair, his eyes were… green. Really green.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil’s eyes sharpen. “Short hair? Freckles?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy nods. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno knows that asshole too. Dream. One of the beat cops. Always was an arrogant fuckwad. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil drops a kiss onto Tommy’s head, “thank you Toms, you did so good.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy makes a vaguely happy noise and snuggles closer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil looks up at Techno and Techno </span>
  <em>
    <span>grins.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t you fucking dare.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t worry Phil,” Techno says, “you and Tommy hang out, I’ll just go run an errand real quick.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy hums agreeably and finds some way to slump against Phil even more. A soft snore rises out of his chest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Techno you little shit,” Phil hisses. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno waves to him as he heads for the door. “Don’t worry, I’ll save you some.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bastard.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You gonna teach your new kid that kind of talk?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He already knows it, you shithead, get back over here. He’s a cop, he's </span>
  <em>
    <span>mine.</span>
  </em>
  <span>” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Gotta get him off the street as soon as possible Phil,” Techno says, grabbing his keys. “For the good of the people and all.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Techno.</span>
  </em>
  <span>” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno laughs as he softly closes the door behind himself. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>*** </span>
</p><p>
  <span>In the end he’s polite. He has Dream restrained in his basement, he’s just waiting for the rest of the party to arrive. Dream is looking at him, he’s in his dumb little beat cop uniform, his badge in Techno’s hand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“So,” he says, licking his lips, “you got him right? My gift?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh yeah, I got him. Thanks for that.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dream grins at him, like he still thinks he’s a predator, like he thinks this ends in any other way than him dying. Like he thinks Techno is playing a game. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You liked it?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure,” Techno says, because he’s still got time to kill. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dream practically wiggles, delighted. Techno is fine with the kids all liking Phil, but </span>
  <em>
    <span>why</span>
  </em>
  <span> does the creepy, off his rocker serial killer guy have to like </span>
  <em>
    <span>him?</span>
  </em>
  <span> Maybe </span>
  <em>
    <span>he</span>
  </em>
  <span> wants to snuggle on the couch with a homeless, bloody teenager. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Alright he doesn’t but he wants to do that more than he wants to put up with this. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re the same,” Dream tells him earnestly, “twin suns, and we’ll burn this city to the ground, together. Forever.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Creepy little shit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I liked your other metaphor better,” Techno says, smiling as he hears the door above them open. “You’re right, wolves are stronger when they’re in a pack.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You better not have started without us,” the voice drifts down from the top of the stairs. Dream stiffens, surprised. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno isn’t. He looks up at them, “I would never.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kristin smiles, and the Lady Death and her Angel descend into the lair of the Blood God.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>Tommy is an idiot. He knows it, he accepts it, he plans for it. Its just part of his day-to-day. He had a roof over his head and food in his stomach--most days. Some days--but he left it all behind to live on the street because his foster parents yelled a lot and hit him a few times. Idiot move. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He got into a police car with that green eyed fuck because he said his foster parents were looking for him. Massive idiot move. Biggest fucking mistake of his life, nearly the last one.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But now that green eyed fuck is on the news. Because he’s dead. Extremely thoroughly dead. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy stares at the TV screen. There are pieces of a puzzle here, he knows that they come together to make a picture. He blinks slowly. His side is hurting, no matter how many pain pills Phil gives him it always hurts a little bit. A slow steady ache that drains his energy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wants to go back to sleep. He’s tired, he’s so tired. Phil is gone, he’s at the store because Tommy wanted Jello. He won’t be back for awhile with it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy stares at the TV. The guy who’d almost killed him stares back from beside the newscaster. The newest victim of the Blood God. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The puzzle pieces slide a little closer together. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He can remember, barely, vaguely, telling Techno and Phil about who hurt him. Who tried to kill him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And now he’s dead. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno left right after that, and Phil had been annoyed with him. He’d said something about someone being his. Its all a jumbled mess of pain and fear and contentedness in Tommy’s mind, a haze of pain and drugs scattered over it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He told Phil and Techno about who hurt him. And now that guy is dead. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil is a police officer, or a detective or whatever. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But the guy didn’t get arrested. He died. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Blood God killed him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The guy--Dream, according to the news--was obsessed with the Blood God. He’d talked about him while he was carving the stupid fucking smiley face into Tommy’s shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’d said something when he was shoving the knife into Tommy’s fucking...spleen or whatever organ is over there. Something about…. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy shuts his eyes, trying to focus. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s so tired. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The stab wound is pulsing more loudly, the pain pills are wearing off. He wants more, but he doesn’t want to call for Techno or Kristin. Something tells him to keep his mouth shut. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s--there was-- </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His thoughts are graceless, uncoordinated. He feels like a toddler trying to fit two massive foam jigsaw pieces together. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dream said...He said something, didn’t he? Tommy was a little </span>
  <em>
    <span>distracted,</span>
  </em>
  <span> what with the whole </span>
  <em>
    <span>getting stabbed</span>
  </em>
  <span> that was also going on, but he whispered something into Tommy’s ear. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His side hurts, he wants to go to sleep, he wants Phil to come back and gently brush his fingers through Tommy’s hair. He wants Techno or Kristin to sit with him. He wants their gentle kindness, the way they don’t seem to care that he’s just...staying here. The unquestioning invitation to stay as long as he needs, as long as he wants. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But the puzzle. The pieces. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dream, the Blood God, what Phil was angry about that night. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy whines softly to himself, burying his face in the arm of the couch. Its so hard to </span>
  <em>
    <span>think.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s so tired. He hurts. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Blood God. Dream. Phil. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The way Techno just...accepted that he had a kid who’d been stabbed in his house. He just </span>
  <em>
    <span>knew</span>
  </em>
  <span> that something had happened. He didn’t ask questions about it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The way he and Phil had coaxed the description of Dream from Tommy’s lips. The way Phil praised him softly and held him close while Techno walked away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil was angry. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil said someone was his. Who? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dream. The Blood God. The tiny little oddities about Techno, Phil, and Kristin. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>You’re the perfect gift.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Dream’s voice, rasping and eager and </span>
  <em>
    <span>hungry</span>
  </em>
  <span> when the knife plunged into Tommy’s side. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Gift.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Blood for the Blood God. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil is the fucking Blood God. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The door opens with a flood of light and the rustle of grocery bags. Tommy stares at Phil, Phil looks at him. Surprised for a moment, and then he smiles, soft and warm and growing more familiar. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A lie? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It has to be a lie. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s the Blood God. He’s a killer. A murderer. Tommy was a fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>gift</span>
  </em>
  <span> to him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s also been kind. So fucking achingly kind and Tommy is desperate for it to be real. For it not to be some fucked up mind game. He’s tired, he hurts, he wants Phil to be </span>
  <em>
    <span>nice</span>
  </em>
  <span> and gentle and loving. He wants it to be </span>
  <em>
    <span>real.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His eyes burn and through blurry vision he can see Phil’s smile drop. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh mate,” he says, so soft, so gentle, so kind. He sets the bags down and comes to kneel in front of the couch. His hand is gentle on Tommy’s cheek as he brushes away the tears. “Its alright, its alright, you’re alright mate, I’m back. Is it hurting again? We’ll get you some more meds, its okay.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy sobs. He’s so </span>
  <em>
    <span>nice</span>
  </em>
  <span> and he wants it to be real. He wants it to be real so fucking badly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shh, I know, I know buddy. Its alright Toms I’m getting them.” Phil takes his hand away and Tommy whines, catching his wrist. He doesn’t want him to go away. He’s suddenly, irrationally afraid that Phil will come back with a knife. With cuffs. With a roll of duct tape. With burning acid green eyes. With blood lust and anger and </span>
  <em>
    <span>you’re street trash, I’m just the cleaning crew, this isn’t even murder, just pest control.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil could easily rip his arm out of Tommy’s grip, but he doesn’t. He doesn’t get angry, he only makes a low noise in the back of his throat. Like </span>
  <em>
    <span>he’s </span>
  </em>
  <span>the one who was hurt. “Oh Toms,” he murmurs, “I’m sorry. Breathe mate, just breathe, I’m right here.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy gasps, exhales, shaking and shuddering. His ragged nails dig into Phil’s skin but Phil doesn’t utter a word of complaint. He only cradles Tommy’s wrist gently, rubbing circles into the underside with his thumb. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Breathe,” he prompts again, “Come on, in for seven, out for five. You can do it mate.” Phil’s thumb traces those steady, soft circles on his wrist as he counts Tommy’s breaths for him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s so kind. Too kind. It has to be fake. This has to be some game. Nobody is this kind. Nobody likes Tommy this much. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Nobody strokes the hair back from his face, nobody croons soft reassurances to him, nobody cares about him that much. Dream was right, he was trash. He was just a spare kid that society wasted resources on. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil is going to kill him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil is the Blood God and Tommy is a </span>
  <em>
    <span>gift.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy desperately lifts Phil’s hand to his face, presses his cheek into Phil’s palm like he could absorb every last bit of this false kindness before it goes away. He doesn’t want it to go away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Easy,” Phil croons, “easy Toms, its alright, you’re here with me, you’re safe.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But he isn’t. He </span>
  <em>
    <span>isn’t.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Gods does he wish he was though. He doesn’t want this to end. He doesn’t want this kindness to go away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He presses harder into Phil’s palm. Phil cups his other cheek in his free hand. “Hey Tommy, Tommy look at me.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy can’t bring himself to disobey. He’s always been a problem kid, a troublemaker, someone who doesn’t listen no matter how much the people in charge of him yell and scream and lash out. But one word in Phil’s gentle voice and he is as obedient as a dog. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re okay, I’m right here, Techno and Kristin are here too, nobody’s gonna get past us. You’re safe. He isn’t gonna get you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy shakes his head, a strangled whine rises out of his throat. “Please,” he chokes out. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Please.”</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What do you need?” Phil asks, “just tell me what you need and I’ll get it for you I promise. Are you hurting? Hungry?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy shakes his head again. He’s exhausted and he is cradled gently in the hands of the man who is going to kill him. But he’s so gentle. So kind. He doesn’t understand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil looks at him with sad eyes, “I wish I could help,” he murmurs softly. “I’m sorry.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy squeezes his eyes shut and lets himself fall limp. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tommy?” Phil asks, his voice tense, “hey mate, open your eyes for me, are you okay?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy cracks open his eye and whines wordlessly at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> Phil’s thumb strokes over his cheek, “you okay?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy has no idea how to respond to that. He just leans into Phil’s touch and shuts his eyes again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay,” Phil says, “I’m gonna get you some more pain meds and take a look at your side, alright?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy frowns at him. He doesn’t want Phil to leave. He doesn’t want Phil to stay, either. Not if all of this is a lie, not if Phil is going to hurt him later. He’s too tired to protest either way. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll be right back,” Phil murmurs, passing his hand one more time over Tommy’s hair before he slips away. Tommy drags open his eyes to watch as he rounds the corner and disappears down the hall. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He needs to leave. He needs to get out of here before Phil gets tired of playing this game. But even if he wasn’t hurt and exhausted, how could he leave Phil’s gentle kindness behind? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Even if its fake. Which it is. It must be. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He can hear voices murmuring softly. Phil, Techno’s deep rumble, Kristin’s lighter chime. Its pathetic, but he loves them. He’s only known them for a few days but they’re so </span>
  <em>
    <span>nice. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>He wonders if Kristin and Techno know who--</span>
  <em>
    <span>what</span>
  </em>
  <span>--Phil is. They must. Maybe they even help out. They work together too seamlessly, too flawlessly for there to be any secrets between them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He isn’t in the den of one monster, he’s in the den of </span>
  <em>
    <span>three.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Its too much. Its all too fucking much. He ran away a week ago, he almost died two days ago. He’s so fucking tired. He hurts, and he just wants people to be nice. He wants these people to be nice. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But they won’t be. Not for long. Not once they get bored of whatever little game they’re playing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A pill bottle rattles. Someone is in the kitchen filling a cup. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey mate,” Phil says, soft and gentle and everything Tommy wants, everything Tommy knows he can’t have. “Can you take these for me?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shouldn’t. He should deny them, or pretend to take them but spit them out once Phil looks away. He can’t be drugged and vulnerable around them. More vulnerable at least. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Kristin pads up behind Phil, a glass of water in her hand. “Hey bud,” she says softly, “I got you some water.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His eyes sting again. Why do they have to be so nice? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh Toms,” Phil murmurs, brushing away the tears gathering at the corners of his eyes. “Its alright mate, you’re safe, we’ve got you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>That is what makes him so unsafe. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But he can’t bring himself to cut off this kindness. He opens his hand and Phil deposits the pills on his palm. His arm feels like it weighs a ton, but Tommy lifts the pills to his mouth and swallows them down. Kristin offers him the water and he swallows that too. If he swallows everything, every last bit of their kindness, maybe it will fill that terrible aching pit in his chest that he is afraid will swallow him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Behind Phil and Kristin’s worried gazes, Techno makes an enlightened grunt. “Was this on when you came in?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil turns and Tommy can see that Techno is pointing to the TV. Its running another news story now, but the headline crawl is still announcing the death of the “smiley serial killer”. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Phil says softly, understandingly. “Oh mate. They showed his picture, didn’t they?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy hesitates for a moment, but then he nods. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil and Kristin make sympathetic noises in near unison, reaching for him with gentle hands. “Its alright,” Phil croons, “he’s not gonna hurt you anymore. Never again, I promise. He’s gone, you’re safe, you’re here with us.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Does that make him safe? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Why did they kill him? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’d given them Tommy. He was theirs to do whatever they wanted with. There’s nobody looking for him. Nobody that cares at least. HIs foster parents probably wrote him off as dead the minute they realized he was gone. His social worker has probably already gotten ten kids on their docket to replace him. He’s nothing, nobody, </span>
  <em>
    <span>trash. </span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Why do these killers treat him like he’s something precious? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You killed him,” Tommy mutters, the words slip through his lips with barely a thought. All three of the faces of the Blood God freeze. “Are you gonna kill me too?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The Blood God looks at him through three sets of eyes, hungry, starving, always starving for more blood, and here he sits, vulnerable, helpless. The Blood God lifts one of its hands and gently touches his cheek. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Phil chokes out, “no, Tommy, never. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Never.</span>
  </em>
  <span> We’d never hurt you, I swear on my life.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh Tommy,” Kristin murmurs, kneeling beside him, “you must have been so scared.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno crosses the room, silent and dangerous as a big cat. He easily fits into the space between Phil and Kristin, looming over Tommy like a mountain. Like a wall. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His hand is gentle when he lays it on Tommy’s head. “Everyone we kill is to protect people. We killed him for touching you, for hurting you, and all those other kids. We won’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>ever</span>
  </em>
  <span> hurt you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And somehow its easy to believe him. Tommy leans into his touch even though it strains the injury on his side. Techno could have killed him, the first night he was here. Desperate and bleeding and terrified. Techno had no trouble holding him down. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But he'd helped him instead of hurting. He'd called Phil and Kristin and they could have killed him too, but they didn't. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It could be fake, but why? Why bother with that? Dream's smiling mask of kindness only lasted until Tommy was at his mercy. Tommy is already at the mercy of the Blood God, and the Blood God has proven more than merciful. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy sighs and closes his eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"You gonna go back to sleep mate?" </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He nods. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Okay, sleep well." And the Blood God strokes over his hair. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And the Blood God pulls up the blankets.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And the Blood God presses a gentle kiss to his forehead. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"Love you," Tommy murmurs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>"We love you too," the Blood God answers.</span>

    <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>In case it isn't entirely clear, Tommy doesn't know that Phil and Kristin have their own titles, as far as the wider public knows, The Blood God is one person, but since Tommy is pretty sure they're all killing people (he is correct) he assumes they're all called the Blood God. Its not like they're gonna take the time to tell him their cool serial killer codenames. </p><p>((plus it let me do some fun imagery. At least I think its fun))</p></blockquote>
