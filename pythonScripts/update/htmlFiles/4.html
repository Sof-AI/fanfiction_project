      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Tommy cracks an eye open.<br/>Wilbur’s eyes are hovering above him, creased with worry.<br/>“What the fuck?” Tommy rasps.<br/>“Hi mate,” Phil says to his left, Tommy turns, and Philza fucking Minecraft himself, in all his glory is in his shitty ass apartment.<br/>Philza Minecraft is...standing next to his closet. There are clothes in his hands, Tommy’s clothes.<br/>Is Philza Minecraft stealing his clothes? Is that his life now?<br/>“What are you fuckers doing here?”<br/>Wilbur snorts, “idiot child, you told me you were sick and you didn’t have anyone taking care of you. Of course we came.”<br/>How the fuck are they in his apartment? He’s one hundred percent certain that he didn’t give any of these fuckers a key. </p><p> </p><p>OR: A common idiom says that if you turn up the temperature slowly, a frog will stay in the water until its too late to leave. Tommy's not a frog, but its hard to tell how hot things are getting when you have a fever</p></blockquote>

      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Tiny little nitpick, technically that frog thing isn't true. The scientist conducting that experiment (Friedrich Goltz) removed the frog's brains to see if they had souls and the little dudes have been getting dunked on ever since. </p><p>Anyway! Technically I am supposed to be on hiatus but it has been a Really rough week physically and mentally  and posting fic makes me feel better so I'm doing it. </p><p>This is a kidnapping but its a soft kidnapping because sometimes u just need to write like 17k words of a fictional character being doted on while their sick and that's just where I'm at. Hope y'all enjoy &lt;3</p><p>For Reader Safety, this fic was rated on the Zambo Scale and received the "it was soft and made me happy" response. No Zambo Walks were required in the reading of this fic</p><p> </p><p> </p><p>  <i> <b> All of this is Platonic and written about the characters, not remotely the CCs. </b></i><br/>  <b> </b><br/></p></blockquote>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>It starts with him being tired. He’s always tired, so he doesn’t notice. He goes to work and shuffles through his shift. Dream yells at him, he burns himself on some lady’s triple mocha macchiato whatever the fuck it is. The usual sort of day. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>What really makes him realize how tired he feels is when Wilbur comes in. Usually seeing Wilbur is enough to perk him up, he’s a bitch, but he’s still Tommy’s favorite customer. Tommy is glad to see him, but he has no fucking clue why the Wilbur comes here. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s way too much of a rich bitch to be coming to this coffee shop. They aren’t even hipster-y, so he’s not slumming it for the instagram points. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Really, the only reason he might be coming here is well. To see Tommy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But that’s dumb. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They’re friends and all, sure. Tommy’s hung out with him, he’s even met his family. They’re nice people, but they’re </span>
  <em>
    <span>rich people.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Rich people don’t come to coffee shops to hang out with former foster-kids who are technically on the run.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Well, rich people aside from Wilbur, apparently, since he keeps coming back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But today Tommy’s really not in the mood. He’s almost off his shift, he’s tired, his head hurts. He wants to go curl up in his bed and sleep for a week. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The bells over the door make his head pound. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tommy!” Wilbur sings, cheerful and </span>
  <em>
    <span>loud.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Gods is he loud.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck off bitch,” Tommy mutters, as per protocol. He just wants to get Wilbur’s order over with. He always comes at the end of Tommy’s shift so he’s become sort of a signal for Tommy that he’s nearly done. Usually he sticks around after work to talk to Wilbur, but he doesn’t think he’s going to today. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur comes to a stop directly in front of the counter. Dream isn’t here so Tommy’s snagged a barstool from the other side of it and he’s sitting with his head in his arms. Wilbur pokes him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy growls and stubbornly refuses to look up. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Ching.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fuck he forgot about the fucking bell. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Ching...ching...ching...ching-ching.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy is going to </span>
  <em>
    <span>literally</span>
  </em>
  <span> murder him. He searches blindly with one hand, feeling for the bell. Wilbur laughs and he can hear something sliding along the counter. He’s fucking moving it. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Ching-ching-ching. </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy groans and slowly lifts his head. His neck is sore. Ugh. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur looks as disgustingly put-together as always. Like he just stepped out of a magazine. Bastard. He’s grinning widely at Tommy, “are you ready for my order?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Tommy mutters, snatching the bell and only stopping from throwing it across the room is that it seems like a lot of effort. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Uuuugh.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur’s smile fades. “You alright?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine,” Tommy mutters, laying his head back down. “Tired. Must have slept like shit or something.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur hums understandingly and runs his fingers through Tommy’s hair. Usually he would spring up and smack Wilbur’s hand away. He doesn’t bother with it now. Wilbur’s not gonna give up on it and it feels nice. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur’s nails scratch at his scalp.  “Aw Toms,” he croons, “you’re so sweet when you’re sleepy.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck off,” Tommy mutters. “Do you want coffee or what?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He tries to pick up his head but Wilbur nudges it back down. Whatever. Its not worth fighting him on. Tommy sighs softly, tilting his head so Wilbur can reach more. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hm, no.” Wilbur says. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>What? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy tilts his head more so he can poke an eye out into the </span>
  <em>
    <span>unnecessarily</span>
  </em>
  <span> bright world and look at Wilbur. “Why the fuck would you come here if you don’t want coffee?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur laughs, throwing his head back like its the funniest shit he’s ever heard. Fucking theatrical bastard. Everything’s a goddamn show with him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t make you get me coffee, gremlin, you look exhausted. Come on, you can clock out a few minutes early, right?”  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy blinks at him stupidly.  “What?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll get you a hot chocolate from that place across the street,” Wilbur sing-songs. “Come on, come hang out with me for a little bit.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy sighs, “I’m tired Wilbur.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur takes his hand away, Tommy has to bite back a whine. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He opens his eyes to find Wilbur leaning over the counter, mirroring Tommy’s pose. His chin resting on his folded arms, his brown eyes watching Tommy from inches away. “Please?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy sighs again, “fine.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur goes back to petting his hair. Tommy shuts his eyes again with a little hum that he’s sure Wilbur doesn’t pick up on. Despite his words, Wilbur sits with Tommy, running his fingers through his hair for a good few minutes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy is nearly asleep when Wilbur pulls his hand away again. “Come on Toms,” he says gently, “up you get. Let’s get your hot chocolate.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dream’s gonna ride my ass for leaving early,” Tommy mutters, slowly sitting up and untying his apron. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You could always come work for me,” Wilbur sing-songs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not gonna be your fucking errand boy,” Tommy growls, dragging the stool back to its proper place. He puts all the machines on idle, the afternoon crew will be here after lunch to continue work for the day. Usually he’d clean up a bit for them but...fuck it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You wouldn’t be my errand boy,” Wilbur snorts, “you’d be...hm. I dunno. I’d find something for you if that’s what you really wanted.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy snorts, “in that case I want to be CEO.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll see what I can do, but I think dad might have a few things to say about it.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s old anyway,” Tommy grumbles, “he needs to retire, get some fresh blood in.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur laughs, loud and chiming. “I’m telling him you said that.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fucking do it,” Tommy mutters. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Good.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur chuckles again and throws his arm around Tommy’s shoulders as he comes around the counter. Again, this usually isn’t something Tommy would allow, but he does today. Because he’s cold, and tired, and Wilbur is warm and solid. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur bumps their heads together with a happy hum. Bastard. Tommy shoves at him, but there isn’t really much force to it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He gets his hot chocolate, and its all the sweeter for coming from Dream’s competition. Fucker deserves it. He does end up hanging out with Wilbur, but its much more quiet than their usual activities. He just kind of lets Wilbur drag him to the park and sits under his arm while the world goes by them. Its nice. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He goes to sleep under every blanket he owns because his landlord is a fuckface who can’t fix the heating for shit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wakes up with a pounding headache and soreness lingering in every joint. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fuuuuck. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy blinks his eyes open, they feel crusty and heavy and even </span>
  <em>
    <span>they’re</span>
  </em>
  <span> sore. He fumbles around half-heartedly for his phone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Its noon. He missed his shift. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Double fuck. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s two missed calls from Dream. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Triple fuck.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy groans, fuck his throat is sore too. His nose is stuffy, it must have been going down his throat all fucking night. Shit. He flicks the missed calls up. Dream left him a voicemail. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Uuuugh.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He taps it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The sound of the robotic lady grates on his ears like someone is fucking rubbing the inside of his eardrums with sandpaper or something. Dream’s voice is even worse. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Tommy this is the third time you’ve been late without calling in. I’m done putting up with your lazy bullshit, don’t bother coming in tomorrow.”</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The phone beeps and the voicemail robot lady asks him if he’d like to delete the message. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy feels kind of like he’s going to cry. He doesn’t--he needs that job. He’s barely been scraping by with rent as it is, he’s missed a month already, his landlord isn’t going to let that shit fly a second time. Tommy had to </span>
  <em>
    <span>beg</span>
  </em>
  <span> him and agree to do a bunch of shit around the building to get him to let it slide the first time.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was hard enough finding the job at the coffee shop. Nobody wants to hire </span>
  <em>
    <span>him.</span>
  </em>
  <span> He’s loud, and abrasive, and he can’t pay attention or hold still for shit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s going to lose his apartment. He’s going to have to go back to the streets. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tears prickle at his eyes. He doesn’t want to </span>
  <em>
    <span>deal</span>
  </em>
  <span> with this. He doesn’t want to go back to sleeping in alleyways and begging for scraps. He thought he was finally making it, that he could actually do this. Run away and just take care of himself. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He could go back, he knows, back to the foster care system. All it would take is a call. He’s got minutes on his phone still. He could do it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He doesn’t want to. He isn’t going back to that shit. No more houses, no more pity, no more rules that don’t make sense, no more angry fists raised against him. He’d rather sleep on the street than go back to that. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He sobs, and its hoarse and painful and he doesn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>feel good.</span>
  </em>
  <span> He just wants--he wants Wilbur. He wants to go back to yesterday, sitting on a bench in the park, hot cocoa cradled close, sheltered under Wilbur’s arm. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He knows he’s sick, he’s not a fucking idiot. He’s sick and he just wants someone to take care of him. He wants </span>
  <em>
    <span>Wilbur</span>
  </em>
  <span> to take care of him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s seen movies and shit, he knows that most kids get people to make them soup and tea and rub their backs when they throw up. He’s always wanted that. Deep in the shriveled, stunted, shadow of a heart that he’s got he wants that. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But he can't ask that. Sure, they’ve hung out, sure Wilbur’s said that if Tommy needs something he can call. But that’s for like, a ride home or something. Not to take care of him when he’s sick. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy knows how it goes. If you take too much, if you’re too expensive, too needy, people drop you like a hot coal. He doesn’t want to lose Wilbur. Not when he’s already losing everything else. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’ll just--he’ll rest. He’ll get over this sickness, its probably just a cold or something, and he’ll start looking for another job. He can even do it online, there’s websites for that he’s pretty sure. His papers were good enough to fool Dream, he can probably convince some other idiot that he’s over eighteen. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But not now. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Right now he is just… so tired. And sore. He slowly goes about hauling himself out of bed. He’s pretty sure he has some sort of medicine for at least some of these symptoms. He could take some off-brand advil for the headache at least, that might let him get back to sleep.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He staggers to the medicine cabinet, but the pill bottle is empty. The only thing he’s got in the little medicine area on his counter is a lonely cough drop. He doesn’t even remember ever </span>
  <em>
    <span>buying</span>
  </em>
  <span> cough drops. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fuck it. He unwraps it, the wrapper kind of sticks to it but its not like </span>
  <em>
    <span>paper</span>
  </em>
  <span> is gonna kill him. He pops it into his mouth. It’ll help with the sore throat a little bit at least. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He crawls back into bed and pulls the blankets close. Its so fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>cold </span>
  </em>
  <span>in this goddamn apartment. He hates it here. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shivers, snuggling deeper into the blankets for all the good it’ll do him. He shuts his eyes and tries to sleep. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His head pounds, slow and steady, and his joints ache in time, and his nose is running, the cough drop tastes kind of off as he moves it around in his mouth. He feels like he can barely breathe with all the snot in his nose. He whines, its not like there’s anyone here to hear him. Its fine. He can be miserable. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He can’t sleep though. He’s exhausted, but he’s just too </span>
  <em>
    <span>everything </span>
  </em>
  <span>to sleep. He sighs and rolls over. He wants Wilbur. But he can’t have Wilbur. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He can have the next best thing though. He grabs his phone and flips to his gallery. He’s got videos saved. Wilbur and his family, laughing and talking and look. Tommy knows its weird, and creepy, but he’s never been able to fall asleep alone. He likes to have other people, other voices around. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Its even better if its people he knows. So last time he hung out with Wilbur’s family he’d recorded their voices a bit. Just to fall asleep to on bad nights. He’s just about to hit play and try to let himself drift off to that when his phone starts ringing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He flinches and groans at the obnoxious music. Wilbur. Why the fuck is Wibur calling him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy stares at the picture for a few seconds, trying to gather the mental energy to deal with Wilbur. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, he presses the accept call button. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tommy!” Wilbur pouts, “where are you? You weren’t at the shop! I came to see my favorite gremlin.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Right. Fuck. the shop. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s not ever going to be there again, cause he got fired. Tears prickle in his eyes again. He sniffles, wiping them away. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tommy?” the change in Wilbur’s voice is immediate. All of the teasing humor gone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy grunts, “‘m here.” He mutters. His voice sounds terrible, rasping and quiet. It hurts to talk. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tommy, what’s wrong?” Wilbur demands, his voice is that weird tone that people get when they’re trying to be calm but serious shit is going down. “Why do you sound like that? Are you crying? Where are you? What’s wrong?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Holy shit. What the fuck. That is...so much more response than Tommy is prepared to deal with. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck off,” he mutters, “I’m just sick. I’m not fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>crying.” </span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wipes the tears away from the corners of his eyes. Technically they didn’t fall, so he isn’t crying. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sick?” Wilbur demands. “I thought you said you just didn’t sleep well. You should have told me you weren’t feeling good yesterday, I’d have taken you home. Rest is important, Toms.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy grunts. Wilbur is silent on the other end, clearly not accepting that as an answer. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fucking bastard. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I jus’ wanted to spend time with you,” Tommy mutters. Because he </span>
  <em>
    <span>had</span>
  </em>
  <span> been planning to blow Wilbur off and get some sleep. But he’d stayed. Because it was Wilbur, because he was soft and warm and funny and he had his arm around Tommy’s shoulders. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh sunshine,” Wilbur says softly. “Are you taking care of yourself? You got soup? Tea? Medicine?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy grunts again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Is anyone watching over you?” Wilbur asks and suddenly the tears are prickling at Tommy’s eyes again.  Fuck. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not a fuckin’ baby,” Tommy mutters, “I’m fine.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t help but notice you didn’t answer any of those questions, Tommy,” Wilbur says, an odd note of sternness in his tone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck you,” Tommy mutters, “its just a fuckin’ cold, ‘m not gonna die or some shit.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tommy--” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy presses the end call button. He’s tired, and he just </span>
  <em>
    <span>knows</span>
  </em>
  <span> that Wilbur is going to offer to bring him something. He’s always doing that, bringing Tommy treats, food, things that he thinks he’d like, or things that ‘made him think of Tommy.’ </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy has a whole shelf full of those sorts of things. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He knows that Wilbur would offer to bring him some food or something and he </span>
  <em>
    <span>knows</span>
  </em>
  <span> that he would accept it, and he knows that if Wilbur came to his apartment Tommy would give in to that weak, grasping, needy part of himself that desperately wants to be taken care of. And that would ruin everything. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s not going to lose Wilbur because he feels a little under the weather.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He just needs to sleep, he’ll feel better when he wakes up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He hits ignore when Wilbur calls him again. He’s sleeping, bitch. He puts his phone on silent and goes back to his audio files. He picks the longest one and curls around his phone as it begins playing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Its all three of them, Phil, Wilbur, and even Techno. Mellow, for once, it had been late in the evening, they’d been out doing shit all day, they were low on energy for once. Tommy thinks that he’d been curled up on the arm of their couch, his foot just barely stretching out to touch Techno’s hip. A subtle point of contact, the only bit he would allow himself. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They’re talking about business shit, the sort of stuff that’s always gone over Tommy’s head. That’s what makes this one so good. He doesn’t have to understand, he doesn’t have to pay attention, he can just let their voices wash over him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Despite the ache of his body, despite how hard it is to breathe, despite the aching loneliness in his chest, he manages to drift to sleep. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>*** </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“--been living here the </span>
  <em>
    <span>whole time?</span>
  </em>
  <span>” Techno asks incredulously, “and you’ve just been </span>
  <em>
    <span>letting him?”</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shh,” Wilbur’s voice scolds, “you’ll wake him up. I didn’t really have much </span>
  <em>
    <span>choice,</span>
  </em>
  <span> now did I? You know what he’s like, he wouldn’t accept fucking cash unless it was tips at the coffee shop, you think he’d let me move him to another apartment?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Easy mate,” Phil murmurs, “we’re all upset, let’s be calm. Wilbur’s right, Tommy wouldn’t have accepted anything on his own, but this place </span>
  <em>
    <span>is</span>
  </em>
  <span> unacceptable.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>What the fuck are they talking about? Tommy doesn’t remember this part of the recording. He frowns. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey sunshine, are you waking up?” That’s Wilbur. But there’s breath fanning across his ear accompanying the words. His phone can’t do that, he’s pretty fucking sure. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy cracks an eye open. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur’s eyes are hovering above him, creased with worry. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What the fuck?” Tommy rasps. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hi mate,” Phil says to his left, Tommy turns, and Philza fucking Minecraft himself, in all his glory is in his shitty ass apartment. He’s in a suit that probably costs more than the rent. His shoes are probably enough to pay to fix the fucking heating six times over. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His shoes are on Tommy’s shitty carpet. In Tommy’s shitty apartment. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Philza Minecraft is...standing next to his closet. There are clothes in his hands, Tommy’s clothes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Is Philza Minecraft stealing his clothes? Is that his life now? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno is standing beside him, an open bag held out. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How are you feeling?” Wilbur asks, suddenly drawing Tommy’s attention, a hand touches his forehead. Tommy makes an appreciative noise in his throat and leans into the touch. Wilbur’s hand is cool against his forehead, his touch is gentle. “He’s burning up,” Wilbur says anxiously. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let me see,” Phil says, and the bed dips under another weight. Tommy drags his eyes open again and Phil is hovering over him. “Open your mouth for me mate, let’s see what you’re running.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy opens his mouth to ask what the hell Phil means but Phil just sticks something under his tongue. Tommy jerks back, his hand reaches up and catches Phil’s wrist.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Easy mate, leave it in,” Phil murmurs, watching something in his hand intently. Tommy goes cross-eyed trying to figure out what the fuck it is. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s something cool and metallic in his mouth. It beeps. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Is that a fucking thermometer? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Does Tommy even </span>
  <em>
    <span>own</span>
  </em>
  <span> a thermometer? He doesn’t think so. Does Phil just </span>
  <em>
    <span>carry around</span>
  </em>
  <span> a thermometer?? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil takes it out of his mouth and frowns at the number it displays, “how long have you been feeling under the weather mate?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you doing in my apartment?” Tommy rasps. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He was really droopy yesterday,” Wilbur says, “he said he just slept poorly, but obviously that was a lie.” He shoots Tommy a Look. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Why the fuck is he getting a Look? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy makes an offended face back at Wilbur. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Have you taken anything?” Phil interrupts. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy blinks at him, “I had a cough drop? I think it might have been expired though.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“For fuck’s sake,” Wilbur mutters. His arms coil around Tommy and he’s suddenly pulled close to Wilbur’s chest, “you’re a nightmare,” he informs Tommy, “you’re going to give me gray hairs.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck you bitch,” Tommy mutters, shoving at Wilbur’s chest half-heartedly. He doesn’t really want to leave his arms, but he would like some fucking answers. He’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>one hundred percent </span>
  </em>
  <span>certain that he didn’t give </span>
  <em>
    <span>any </span>
  </em>
  <span>of these fuckers a key. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>How the </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck</span>
  </em>
  <span> are they in his apartment? Why is Techno continuing to steal his clothes? Don’t they have enough clothes in their own fancy-ass house? He’s never seen Wilbur wear the same thing twice and he’s known him for a long ass time. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What are you fuckers doing here?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur snorts, “idiot child, you told me you were sick and you didn’t have anyone taking care of you. Of course we came.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy’s heart thrills at the words. At the simple certainty of them. Tommy needed someone to take care of him, so they came. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy curls closer to Wilbur, just for a second. Wilbur coos wordlessly and pets his hair. Tommy should make him stop doing that, its going to put him back to sleep in a second. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tommy,” Phil says, “do you have a favorite blanket? A toy that comforts you?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy jerks back from the edge of sleep. “What? No. Of course not that--I’m not a fuckin’ baby, Philza Minecraft. Like you I am a big fucking man.”  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil smiles at him, warm and soft, “of course you are, but even I have a favorite blanket mate. I just want you to be comfortable, Wilbur has a comfort toy too, its not just a baby thing.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy blinks at him. “Wait. Why are you asking? Why are you stealing my clothes?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re not stealing your clothes,” Techno snorts, “you think we’d want this shit? We’re packing you a bag.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy makes an offended, confused noise. That just seems unnecessary. Tommy doesn’t call Techno’s clothes shit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mate,” Phil says, “blanket? Toy?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy opens his mouth to answer, then he pauses. “Wait, why the fuck are you packing a bag, what are you--” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur snorts. “We’re taking you </span>
  <em>
    <span>home,</span>
  </em>
  <span> obviously. We’re not letting you be sick </span>
  <em>
    <span>here. </span>
  </em>
  <span>This place is probably half the reason you </span>
  <em>
    <span>are</span>
  </em>
  <span> sick. I can’t believe I let you stay here.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy blinks at him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s a lot to fucking unpack there. His head already hurts. He just wants to go back to sleep. He groans and curls up, burying his face into Wilbur’s chest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur pets his hair again, massaging gently at his temples. Tommy falls limp with a sigh. “...I have Henry,” He mutters into the darkness of Wilbur’s shirt. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where’s he?” Wilbur asks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’s on the,” Tommy goes through the effort of raising a hand and waving it in the general direction of his living room. “The chair in there. My favorite blanket too.” He’d forgotten to grab both of them last night, and he hadn’t been clear-headed enough to do it today either. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He can hear Phil walking across his apartment, the floor creaking, the walls groaning. “I’ve got him. Techno?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno grunts, “I’ve got enough. We may as well just replace all this shit.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Later,” Phil says, “hand the bag to Wilbur and take Tommy.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy drags his eyes open. He should...say something. Punch someone. That seems like way too much effort. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why does Techno get to carry him?” Wilbur pouts. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Because your noodle arms’ll drop him,” Techno snarks. Wibur makes an offended noise as Tommy is pulled from his arms. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shivers, its fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>cold</span>
  </em>
  <span> oustide of the blankets. He whines. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Easy kid, we’re just going out to the car,” Techno rumbles, pulling Tommy close. He’s warm, warmer than Wilbur. “We’ll turn the heat on for you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy nods and snuggles closer. His eyes fall shut again and sleep drags him down. </span>

  <p>
  <span>“Hey mate,” someone shakes his shoulder. He groans. “I know, just wake up for a second for me.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Why the fuck is Phil here? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy cracks open an eye. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Drink this,” Phil says, and the rim of a small plastic cup presses against his lips, “it’ll help you feel better.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy blinks at him, but Phil only smiles, gentle and warm. Tommy raises a shaky hand and tilts the cup up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oh holy shit that tastes </span>
  <em>
    <span>vile.</span>
  </em>
  <span> What the </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck </span>
  </em>
  <span>did Phil just feed him? Poison? Was that poison? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy coughs, trying to spit it out but Phil’s hand covers his mouth. “Swallow, you can have some water after, I know it tastes bad, but it’ll help.” He tilts Tommy’s head back until he swallows automatically. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy coughs and pries his hand away. His stomach jumps, oh shit is he gonna throw up? He swallows hard, trying to hold it back. A glass of water appears in front of him. “Swish the first sip,” Phil recommends, “go slow if your stomach is feeling touchy.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy obeys, too confused to do anything else. Holy shit he’s thirsty. He gulps down the rest of the water. When the glass is empty he lowers it to his lap and finally looks around. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>This is...not his apartment? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>This looks like Phil’s fancy fucking house, but not any room he’s been in before. He’s in a massive bed, Henry is on the pillow beside where his head was laid. His ratty old blanket looks like an ugly fucking duckling among all the others. And there is a lot of others. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Why are there so many blankets? And pillows? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Why is he </span>
  <em>
    <span>here?</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What the fuck?” He manages to croak. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re at our house,” Phil says, “You said you were okay with coming home with us, do you remember? So we can take care of you?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>No, he doesn’t remember that. But he’s fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>here</span>
  </em>
  <span> and its not like they would have just...yoinked him from his fucking bed. He would have had to let them in. He can vaguely remember them in his apartment, he must have opened the door for them, even though he can’t remember it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Its not too much of a stretch to think he’s forgotten some other parts of the visit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay,” he says instead of dealing with his apparent amnesia. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil smiles at him and brushes hair out of his eyes. “That medicine is probably gonna knock you out pretty quick, do you want to take a shower and change into something more comfortable first?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy leans into the touch and blinks open his eyes again. Oh, he’s still in his clothes from work. “Yeah,” he croaks. Fuck his throat is sore. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay,” Phil says, “I’ll get it started for you, it’ll be nice and warm by the time you get to the bathroom. I’ll put some clothes on the counter for you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy nods against his palm but then Phil </span>
  <em>
    <span>takes it away.</span>
  </em>
  <span> What the fuck. Tommy whines, reaching up to grab it again. Phil could easily avoid him, but he doesn’t. He tangles his fingers with Tommy’s. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh mate,” He murmurs, “come on, just a quick rinse off. You’ll feel better and then I’ll sit with you, okay?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy pouts, but he nods again all the same. Phil leaves, and he can hear a shower start the next room over. He just has to...get out of bed and get in it. That’s fine, he can do that. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>bones</span>
  </em>
  <span> feel sore. Why? What did he do to deserve this?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He sits up, oh. Oh shit. Oh </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck</span>
  </em>
  <span> he’s dizzy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He feels like he’s fuckin...in the pocket of a giant’s ballgown and the giant is doing a fucking tango or some shit. The whole world is spinning and dipping and lurching around him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy groans and puts a cautious hand over his mouth. Is he gonna throw up? He really fucking hates throwing up, he doesn’t want to do that. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You alright mate?” Phil asks, a hand touches his shoulder, thumb rubbing a little circle on his back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy makes himself nod, “dizzy.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil makes a sympathetic noise, “you want some help walking?” </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Yes.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But he makes himself croak, “no, ‘m fine. Thanks.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He can’t take too much, he can’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>be</span>
  </em>
  <span> too much. Its bad enough he’s here, in this bed, in this house. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He forces himself to his feet. His knees wobble, his muscles whine protest, he pushes on. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The bathroom is fancy, just like fucking everything in this house, the shower isn’t even one of those ones that’s combined with the tub. Its just a shower. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Rich fuckers. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy slowly peels off his clothes, grimacing at the red pattern of wrinkles pressed into his skin. He can see the fucking weave of his jeans. He must have slept </span>
  <em>
    <span>hard.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ugh. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He steps into the water, like Phil promised, its warm. The steam feels better on his airway than just plain air. Without really meaning to, Tommy lowers himself to the floor, he doesn’t know if you’re really supposed to sit in the shower but he’s gonna fucking do it. He’s tired. The water is nice. Fuck the rules. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He only drags himself out of the water when he realizes he’s in real danger of falling asleep under it. They have so much hot water, his would have run out by now. He wants to live in this shower. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But he definitely shouldn’t sleep here. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He drags himself back to his feet and shuts off the water--why must it be so complicated. Who the fuck needs a </span>
  <em>
    <span>button</span>
  </em>
  <span> for their shower? That’s fucking dumb. He wants to speak to someone’s manager. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He pats half-heartedly at himself with a towel and grabs the clothes on the bathroom counter. These...definitely aren’t his clothes. This looks like something </span>
  <em>
    <span>Wilbur</span>
  </em>
  <span> would wear. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s pretty sure he remembers Phil stealing his clothes. Why is he now stealing Wilbur’s? Does Phil just have a clothes stealing problem? Is that what he built his fortune on? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Whatever, its far too complicated to think about. Tommy pulls on the soft pants and even softer sweater. Its too big for him, but its kind of nice. He shivers and pulls his arms in close. Its so cold outside of the shower. He should have stayed in there. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tommy?” Phil calls through the door, “you alright mate? I heard the water turn off.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Tommy calls back, the soreness is back in his throat. Headache is also present and accounted for, achiness too. The whole gang’s here. Great. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He fumbles with the door handle for a second and then opens it. Phil is waiting on the other side, a sympathetic smile on his face. “Did it help any?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy nods, because he does feel a little better. He’s really cold though, now that he’s not surrounded by the warm water. He shivers again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, here, I’ve got this for you too,” Phil says, and he has a...blanket? No its got sleeves that he’s guiding Tommy’s arms through. Hey what the fuck? Tommy tugs his arms away and pulls the rest of the--robe? Is that what this is?--around himself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Its way too big for him, he’s pretty sure that the only person this would fit is </span>
  <em>
    <span>Techno.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Its a plush monstrosity, fluffy and thick and warm and Tommy hopes it isn’t Techno’s because its </span>
  <em>
    <span>his</span>
  </em>
  <span> now. He is never giving this back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil smiles at him and brushes a wet lock of hair behind his ear, then frowns. “Hm, let’s get your hair a bit more dried before you lay down again, it’ll just make you cold.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy blinks dumbly as Phil ducks behind him into the bathroom. He appears with another stupidly fluffy towel a blink later. Maybe Tommy’s blinks are getting a bit long. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then he drops the towel over Tommy’s head and starts ruffling it gently over his head. What the fuck? Is Phil fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>drying</span>
  </em>
  <span> his hair. Tommy makes a displeased noise in the back of his throat and tries to duck away from the touch. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>What the fuck? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I c’n get it,” he mutters, grabbing vaguely at Phil’s hands. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Its alright, I want to,” Phil says, scrubbing the towel over his hair again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy stands there, dazed and more than a little confused as Phil finally lowers the towel. He blinks again, Phil beams. “Aw, you look like you’ve got bedhead.” He tosses the towel into the bathroom casually and goes at Tommy’s hair with his fingers, smoothing it down and scratching his nails against Tommy’s scalp. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy leans into his touch with a soft noise, it feels nice, sue him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on mate, back to bed with you,” Phil murmurs, “you look like you’re gonna fall asleep on your feet.“</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy grunts agreeably and lets Phil lead him over to the pile of blankets. Theoretically there’s probably a bed under there somewhere. Phil guides him in with a hand on his arm, which is probably a good idea because Tommy would probably have just let himself fall and have gravity sort out the rest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Only then the bed shifts again, and Phil’s arms are around him, and his ear is against Phil’s chest, hearing Phil’s heartbeat as he fusses with pulling the blankets around them both. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’re you..?” Tommy mutters. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m just keeping you company mate,” Phil murmurs, his voice sounding strange under Tommy’s ear. “Go to sleep, I’ve got you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy grunts again and lets his eyes fall shut. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>*** </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Someone strokes his hair, steady and soft. There’s a deep voice speaking overhead. Tommy tries to gather the mental energy to focus on it, who’s talking? What are they saying? Is he supposed to be listening? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He shifts, trying to pick up his head. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The voice pauses. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go back to sleep, Theseus, its alright.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The fingers card through his hair again. He can feel a few hairs catching on something. Rings. Techno. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy cracks open an eye. He can see Techno’s legs in front of him, stretching out under the blankets. Oh, he’s got his head on Techno’s leg. Why does he have it there? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Its warm, at least. He’s not gonna bother moving it unless Techno makes him. He lets his eyes fall shut again. Techno’s hand pets his hair more firmly, like a reward. Then pages turn, and his voice starts up again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oh, he’s reading something. A book. A story. Tommy tries half-heartedly to follow along, but all these people have weird names. Its hard to keep them straight. He gives up pretty quickly and just listens to Techno’s voice washing over him, carrying him out like a piece of driftwood on the tide, cradled on the waves until sleep finally pulls him down again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>*** </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Soft guitar strumming. Wilbur. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Why the fuck is Wilbur in his apartment? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy opens his eyes. Oh, he’s still laying with his head in Techno’s lap. Huh. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Why is Techno in his apartment? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oh, no, he’s not in his apartment. He’s in Phil’s house. He can feel someone’s knee resting lightly against his back, not digging in, just touching. A point of contact, an anchor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We should have done this forever ago,” Wilbur says softly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You were the one who wanted to wait to bring him home,” Techno disagrees. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I wanted it to be something like this,” Wilbur says, “soft, sweet. He’s so determined to be independent, just bringing him wouldn’t have worked. He’d fight. We have to show him that there’s no reason to.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He’ll probably try to run after he’s feeling better,” Techno says. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe,” Wilbur agrees, “but I don’t think so. He’s so desperate for love it’ll be easy to convince him this is for the best. Just look at him.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A hand over Tommy’s cheek, long fingered and thin. Wilbur. He hums happily and leans into it, curls his hands around the wrist, pulling it close. He presses his cheek into Wilbur’s palm and is rewarded with a soft stroke of Wilbur’s thumb over his temple. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s it Toms,” Wilbur croons, “we love you too.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno’s hand drops into his hair. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Even if he does run, it’d be easy enough to catch him. He’ll give in quick, won’t you Tommy?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy hums vaguely, he doesn’t really know what they’re talking about. It doesn’t really matter, he’s pretty sure. As long as they’re here with him they can do whatever they want. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>*** </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey sunshine, come on, open those eyes for me.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy whines. His head is pounding again, the world is spinning. He wants to go back to sleep. He shoves his face into the pillow. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tommy,” Wilbur sings, running a hand through his hair. “Come on gremlin, I need you to eat a little bit for me.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>No, eating sounds terrible. Sleep is all he needs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Its just some soup,” Wilbur coaxes, “Phil made it for you, family recipe and everything, come on sunshine.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy turns his head so he can breathe. Or try. His nose is still stuffy. Ugh. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s a bowl of something steaming on the bedside table. Presumably the soup. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“‘M tired,” he mumbles into the pillow. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know darling,” Wilbur coos, “but I want you to eat something today. You need to keep your strength up. And then you can have some more meds and go back to sleep okay?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy sighs. His eyes start to slip closed again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur takes his hand out of his hair. That’s just fucking uncalled for. Tommy whines. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just a few bites,” Wilbur croons, “then meds, and then you can sleep.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy groans, but he knows WIlbur isn’t going to let this shit go. He is terminally incapable of letting </span>
  <em>
    <span>anything</span>
  </em>
  <span> go. Its easier to just give in now, before he starts doing something crazy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy hauls himself into a sitting position. He feels heavy, aching and tired. He holds out a hand for the soup. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur beams at him, “would you look at that, a sunrise!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It takes a second for him to figure it out. Sunshine, sunrise. He groans, “you’re a fucking bitch.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur laughs and then apparently decides that its okay for him crawl into bed with Tommy? Tommy blinks at him as he scoots beneath the covers, too baffled and exhausted to yell at him like he should. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur’s arm curls around his shoulders and draws him close. Okay no. What the fuck? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy growls and plants a hand in Wilbur’s ribs. “What the fuck are you doing?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“C’mere Toms,” Wilbur coos, notably, </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> explaining what the fuck he thinks he’s doing. “Lemme see you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You see with your eyes, asshole,” Tommy grumbles, but his muscles hurt, his very </span>
  <em>
    <span>bones</span>
  </em>
  <span> ache. It doesn’t take much force for Wilbur to pull him close. Tommy’s head ends up resting on his collarbone, scowling up at the underside of Wilbur’s chin. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shh,” Wilbur coos, “I’ve got you, just have some soup.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He reaches over with his free hand and snags the bowl off the bedside table. Tommy can see into it now, it looks like something creamy and smooth, and it smells like fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>heaven.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Without meaning to, Tommy takes a deep breath and exhales a tiny longing noise. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur coos wordlessly and sets the bowl in his lap. “See? You’ll like it, it’ll be nice on your throat.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy snarls at him, but he is a little hungry. He reaches for the bowl. Wilbur scoots it away, “ah, ah, you can barely sit up. You don’t want to spill, let me.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur picks up the spoon and lets a few drops fall off and into the bowl before raises it to Tommy’s lips. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What the fuck do you think you’re--” he shoves the spoon into Tommy’s mouth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy makes an offended noise and bites down on it before Wilbur can pull it back out. He turns away and holds the goddamn spoon in his </span>
  <em>
    <span>own</span>
  </em>
  <span> hand. “Fuck off dickhead I’m not a fucking baby!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur laughs, softly bouncing Tommy’s head against his chest. “Aw but Toms, you’re my little baby brother.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy groans, not this shit again. “I’m a fuckin’ adult you bitch.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He isn’t, he’s barely sixteen, but Wilbur doesn’t need to know that. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure Toms,” Wilbur says indulgently, “but I’m still older than you. Eat your soup.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mind your own fucking business,” Tommy grumbles, “if I wanna starve to death I fucking will.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur makes a low noise in his throat and holds Tommy closer, “never. We’d never let you do that.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re a fucking weirdo,” Tommy growls. He feels like shit, his head hurts, his throat hurts, Wilbur is being weird and clingy, he just wants to eat his fucking soup and go back to sleep. He scoops up another spoonful of broth and sticks it in his mouth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur, thankfully, manages to be </span>
  <em>
    <span>quiet</span>
  </em>
  <span> while he eats, contenting himself with running his nails over Tommy’s scalp while he eats. Its </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> nice and Tommy </span>
  <em>
    <span>doesn’t</span>
  </em>
  <span> enjoy it. At all.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He only manages about half the bowl before his stomach starts making threatening moves. Tommy tries one more spoonful before he gives up. Setting the utensil down and letting his head flop onto Wilbur’s chest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You should eat more,” Wilbur murmurs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If you make me eat more I’m gonna throw up on you,” Tommy growls, but he’s tired, its more of a grumble really. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur makes a sympathetic noise and takes the bowl away, returning it to the bedside table. “Alright Toms, you think you could manage some meds?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy hums vaguely, watching with little enthusiasm as Wilbur grabs a bottle of something dark colored. There’s a little measuring cup over the lid with a few drops of the medicine clinging to it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ugh. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy scowls at the bottle. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’ll help you sleep,” Wilbur coaxes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fuck it. Tommy nods, holding out a hand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I should have made you take this first,” Wilbur reflects, “then you could wash out the taste with the soup. Oh well, you’re supposed to be pushing fluids anyway. Do you have a favorite flavor of drink by the way?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy shrugs, usually he just drinks water when he’s sick. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sports drink? Sprite? Ginger ale?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Whatever,” Tommy mutters, “you don’t have to buy me shit.” He leans into Wilbur’s side a little more, “you’re doing enough as it is.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur croons and leaves off pouring the medicine to scoop him up in both arms. “Oh sunshine, we’re happy to do this. We’re </span>
  <em>
    <span>ecstatic </span>
  </em>
  <span>that you’re letting us take care of you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy scowls at him, “fucking liar. Nobody likes putting up with sick people.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Its not ‘putting up’ with </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span> Toms. Do you know how long I’ve wanted to bring you home? To have you all wrapped up in my blankets, in Phil’s bed. All safe and warm.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy makes a confused noise deep in his throat. This is </span>
  <em>
    <span>Phil’s</span>
  </em>
  <span> bed? Why the fuck is he in Phil’s bed? He knows for a </span>
  <em>
    <span>fact</span>
  </em>
  <span> that these assholes have guest rooms, and speaking of that. “I’ve been here before, dickhead. You need to get your fuckin’ memory checked.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur chuckles softly, “silly gremlin. You’ll understand soon enough. Just take your medicine like a good child.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He holds the little cup in front of Tommy’s nose. Ugh it smells as bad as it tastes. But it’ll knock him the fuck out at least. Tommy sighs and throws it back like he’s seen people do shots. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He coughs and shudders, grasping frantically for the glass of water Wilbur offers him. He rinses out the taste and groans, handing back the cup. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I know sunshine, it doesn’t taste good does it? You want another bite of soup?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy hums, he kind of does, but it seems like a lot of effort to reach over and pick up the spoon. It’d be easier to just lay here and let the gross flavor linger on his tongue. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Open,” Wilbur coos, and Tommy is confused enough that he obeys. Wilbur deposits a bite of soup in his mouth. Fucking weirdo bastard. Tommy growls at him and hides his face in Wilbur’s shirt. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur only chuckles softly and pets his hair. “Good gremlin,” he coos. Tommy’s gonna fucking bite him. In a little bit. When he wakes up. </span>

    <p>Chapter Notes</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>There were a bunch of people worried in the comments that SBI was using the medicine to drug Tommy and/or make him more sick. They are not, its just Nyquill. Technically, yes, they are drugging him but at this point he's not gonna be making any great escapes Nyquill or no Nyquill, he's sick enough without any help. </p><p>Speaking of him being sick, warning at the beginning of this chapter for a good bit of vomiting. Tommy's having a great time.</p></blockquote>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>He wakes up and the room is dark. There is a weight on the bed beside him and he expects it to be Wilbur, but there are no arms coiled around him. Instead, fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>Techno</span>
  </em>
  <span> is next to him, laying on his back with his hands folded on his stomach like a fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>corpse</span>
  </em>
  <span> or some shit and </span>
  <em>
    <span>why the fuck is he here?</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy squints at him, debating waking the dumbass up to ask what </span>
  <em>
    <span>exactly</span>
  </em>
  <span> he thinks he’s doing. Then his body makes it clear that it did not wake him up to yell at Techno. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His stomach jumps, there’s a familiar, terrible feeling high in his throat. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oh shit. Fuck. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He sits up slowly, carefully, pressing his hand to his mouth. He takes a deep breath, there’s supposed to be ways you can keep from throwing up right? If you hum or some shit? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Quietly as he can, Tommy hums the first thing that comes to mind, one of Wilbur’s songs. It isn’t helping. Fuck that isn’t helping. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He staggers to the bathroom. No, no, he’s not throwing up. He’s not doing it, its terrible and he has decided that society has progressed past the need for him to throw up at three AM or whatever time it is. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He paces, bare feet padding on the tile. Phil’s bathroom is stupidly big. Who needs a bathroom this big? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His stomach jumps again, Tommy whines softly to himself. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>He’s not doing it.</span>
  </em>
  <span> He won’t. He refuses. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His mouth is filling with spit. Shit, shit. Okay maybe he </span>
  <em>
    <span>is</span>
  </em>
  <span> throwing up, fuck. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He throws himself to his knees in front of the toilet. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Its just as terrible as always. He hates throwing up. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Fuck, </span>
  </em>
  <span>he hates this. Tears prickle in the corners of his eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When he’s done he shakily fumbles for the flush. He looks away as the mess goes down, fuck the smell is gonna make him go for another round. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He leans against the little half wall thing that shields the toilet from the rest of the room. He’s hot, all of a sudden. Burning up. He’s going to roast, he’s boiling, </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck.</span>
  </em>
  <span> He presses his forehead to the wall, its blessedly cool. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wrestles with the too-big robe still tied around him. He can’t get it off. He opens the front as much as he can and rips his arms out of the sleeves, letting the top dangle down. The sweater, he’s gonna fucking boil to death in Wilbur’s stupid sweater. He throws that off too, tossing it somewhere behind him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His chest heaves with the force of his breaths, he’s panting like a fucking dog, just trying to cool down. Maybe he could turn on the shower? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Only his stomach lurches again and he’s right back where he started. The second round is even worse than the first. He’s hot and he’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>tired</span>
  </em>
  <span> and it hurts his throat and he just wants it to be </span>
  <em>
    <span>done.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy sobs, dry and hoarse. He doesn’t remember ever being this sick before. He can’t imagine what he’d have done if he had to go through this in his fucking cold-ass apartment, alone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He is pathetically grateful to Wilbur for dragging him here, even if he’s clingy and weird. He doesn’t want to be alone. He wants--</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Ah kid,” Techno murmurs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy jolts, his eyes open. Its dark, but he can see the darker blotch of Techno in the doorway of the bathroom. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lights are coming on,” Techno warns, Tommy throws his elbow over his eyes. He can still tell when the lights go on, but it isn’t as bad as it could be. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He can hear Techno puttering around, getting something out of a cabinet. The water turns on, he can hear a glass filling up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You think you’re done?” Techno asks softly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy groans. Fuck he hopes he is. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Only immediately his hopes are dashed. He lurches back over the toilet. He doesn’t have anything left in his stomach, but apparently his guts haven’t gotten the memo. He’s bent over the toilet dry heaving for what feels like an eternity. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s hot again. Burning up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A hand touches the back of his neck. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy stiffens, but Techno’s skin feels blessedly cool against his. Techno rubs a gentle circle over his back. Tommy’s--Tommy’s never had someone do that for him before. Never had anyone brush back the hair in his face while he pukes his guts out. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Its--</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Well its weird. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But its also nice. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, his stomach gets the memo that there’s no one in the building and he falls back again. His breath is coming hard and fast, deep gasps that still don’t feel deep enough. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno reaches forward and flushes the bile down. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy shudders. And then he’s shivering. He’s fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>freezing.</span>
  </em>
  <span> He’s so fucking cold he doesn’t know how he could have ever been hot. His teeth chatter, desperate, clumsy, he pulls the robe up around himself, its not enough, nothing will ever be enough. He </span>
  <em>
    <span>is</span>
  </em>
  <span> the fucking arctic, his bones are made of </span>
  <em>
    <span>ice.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno wraps his arms around him. He doesn’t feel any warmer than Tommy’s skin but Tommy’s pretty sure you’re supposed to huddle for warmth or some shit.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy clings to him desperately, trying to leech all the heat he can get off Techno. His teeth rattle together, his body is shaking. Fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>hell</span>
  </em>
  <span> he </span>
  <em>
    <span>hates this. </span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Easy, easy,” Techno murmurs, “I’ve got you.” He wraps his arms around Tommy, pulling him even closer. “Fuck, you’re burning up.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy shakes his head. No, he’s not, he’s freezing, can’t Techno feel how cold he is? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>At least his stomach feels like its settled now. He doesn’t think he’s going to throw up again. Yet. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Think I’m done,” he mutters, his voice shaky. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay, you feel up to brushing your teeth a bit? Get the taste out of your mouth?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy nods, he doesn’t really feel up to it but he wants it </span>
  <em>
    <span>out</span>
  </em>
  <span> of his mouth. Ugh. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno helps him up and walks with him to the sink. There’s a toothbrush still in the packaging next to the sink. Tommy’s trembling hands drop it twice trying to unwrap it before Techno takes over. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He doesn’t bother with toothpaste, he just wets it in the sink and scrubs out as much as he can. Techno offers him a cup to rinse with. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What,” Tommy rasps, “you rich bitches too good to get water with your hands? As our ancestors did?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno chuckles softly, “well we don’t chew on leaves to feel better either. Sometimes technology is greater than tradition.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy snorts and swishes the water around his mouth before spitting it into the sink. He sets the glass down and all of a sudden he’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>exhausted.</span>
  </em>
  <span> He thought he was before but he was wrong. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Now</span>
  </em>
  <span> he’s fucking tired. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He drops his weight unceremoniously onto Techno’s arm. Techno doesn’t even grunt or move to brace him better. Fucking...bastard. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on,” Techno murmurs, “back to bed.” He pulls Tommy closer and Tommy rests his head on Techno’s chest. And then Techno is bending down and fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>picking him up.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Slowly, carefully, like he doesn’t want to move too fast, but he still does it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fuck it, if Tommy doesn’t have to walk all the way back to the bed he’s down for being carried like a princess. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hope you don’t mind that its blankets and not some leaves,” Techno says. Tommy blinks dumbly for a second. Oh, right, the ancestors thing. He snorts softly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno doesn’t set him down on the bed like Tommy expects him to. Instead he climbs in, Tommy still in his arms. He pulls the blankets up around them, fussing with them until they lie correctly around Tommy’s shoulders. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Go to sleep,” Techno murmurs, petting Tommy’s hair. “I’ll be here if you feel nauseous again.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy cracks open an eye and looks up at Techno. He doesn’t look like he’s going to fall asleep, his eyes are watching Tommy carefully, intently. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You sh’d sleep too,” Tommy mutters. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll be fine,” Techno says, brushing the hair away from his sweaty forehead, “I’ll keep watch, Theseus. Go to sleep.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy has a hard time coming up with an argument to that. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>***</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Someone is brushing the hair out of his eyes. “Tommy? Tommy could you wake up for a bit?”  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He whines and cracks open an eye. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil is hovering over him. “Hey mate,” he says softly, “can you give me your phone password real quick?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy squints at him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil smiles softly and brushes the hair back from his forehead, leaving his hand there for a moment. “Fever’s going down I think,” he murmurs, “do you want something to drink? Techno said you were up puking last night.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy grimaces. Oh yeah. He’d almost managed to forget about that. That’s probably why his throat feels like the aftermath of a fucking forest fire. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil holds out his phone, “password?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy blinks, “wh’ for?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m gonna call you into work,” Phil says, “you’re not going today, not after last night.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy groans. Right, work. There was...something about work. Dream’s mad at him again he thinks. Fuck. He worms an arm out of the blankets and swipes over his screen. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thanks mate,” Phil says. “I’ll tell Wilbur you’re up. He’ll bring you some ginger ale, go slow with it and if you feel up to it we’ll get you some toast or crackers to try.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy nods and curls back up into the blankets. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The bed seems...oddly empty. Phil is gone, there’s nobody here. He’s alone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He doesn’t...he doesn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>want</span>
  </em>
  <span> to be alone. He wants somebody here with him. He pouts silently to himself. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>This is exactly why he didn’t want to come here, he </span>
  <em>
    <span>knows</span>
  </em>
  <span> he gets clingy. Especially when he’s sick. Too clingy. Its gotten him dumped out of houses before, cut off from friendships. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He holds too tightly. He doesn’t let people go, not until they cut him out like a tumor. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The bedroom door opens again. “Hey Toms,” Wilbur coos, “dad said you were up. How are you feeling?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m gonna start dancing any minute,” Tommy rasps. “Just wait.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur laughs, “yeah you sound like the pinnacle of health, gremlin.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m a healthy man, Wilbur, like a fuckin’ horse. I am too big to be taken down by mere illness. I’m not some sort of weakling, like you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He gets a snort as Wilbur approaches, he’s got a cup in hand. Right ginger ale. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You want to try a little sip of this?” Wilbur asks softly, “you can wait if your stomach is still touchy, but you should drink something if you can.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy holds a hand out for the glass. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Apparently that gesture means something else in the Craft household because Wilbur doesn’t hand him the fucking cup. Instead he plops himself into the bed and pulls Tommy close. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy doesn’t fight it. He’s tired, and he’s glad that Wilbur is here, that he seems like he’s going to stay. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He curls his arm around Wilbur. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur pets his hair softly and makes a happy humming sound. “Aw, you’re so sweet when you don’t feel good sunshine.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy buries his face in Wilbur’s stomach and grunts as disapprovingly as he can manage. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sh, its okay, I won’t tell anyone that you’re a marshmallow on the inside,” Wilbur coos. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy turns to look at him, “marshmallow?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“All soft and sweet,” Wilbur explains. He pets Tommy’s hair again, curling a bit around his finger. “Do you want to go back to sleep, or do you want to watch something?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Watch something? On what? Tommy grunts and lets Wilbur interpret that as he will. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur reaches into the drawer beside the bed and pulls out a remote. He points it at the far wall and pushes a button. A fucking TV descends from the ceiling. Of course it does. Why wouldn’t it? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I hate you so much,” Tommy mutters. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur laughs softly, “what, you scared of the shiny technology? You want to go back to watching grass grow or some shit like our ancestors?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I also hate Techno,” Tommy mutters bitterly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t worry, we’ll introduce you to modern life slowly,” Wilbur coos, “these are called ‘documentaries’ they tell you about the world. Now, I know its scary, but the pictures aren’t real, they can’t hurt you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am going to drown you in your stupid fancy bathroom,” Tommy growls. “The proletariats will overthrow you. They’re setting up the guillotine as we speak.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur laughs and runs a hand through Tommy’s hair. “Bold of you to assume they’d be enough to take us on.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Just turn on something,” Tommy mutters, “I want to hear a less annoying voice.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Any preference?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nature,” Tommy mutters. “I need to see a fucking tree after all this shit.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He has no idea what the documentary is about. He falls back asleep the minute the narrator starts talking. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He dreams of voices speaking over his head. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“...tried calling him in but </span>
  <em>
    <span>apparently</span>
  </em>
  <span> he was fired yesterday too.” Phil? He sounds annoyed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His voice is fuzzy and distant. Tommy feels fuzzy and distant. Just out of reach of consciousness. Is he dreaming? You’re supposed to be able to fly and shit if you realize you’re dreaming in the dream right? Can he fly? That’d be fun. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur growls, “fucking bastard. His boss has always been an ass.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But a convenient one, this time,” Phil says. A hand pets his hair, Tommy leans into it with a sigh. “Techno’s dealing with his apartment. Nobody will be asking questions.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Another hand rubs over his shoulders, spreading out on his back like its trying to claim all of him. “Good,” Wilbur purrs. “Nobody will notice he’s gone. He’s all ours. Forever. Aren’t you sunshine?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy hums, and tries to lift his head. Phil presses him back down, “hush little one. You’re still sick. Rest, we’ll keep you safe.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy sighs and drifts back down to sleep. </span>

  <p>
  <span>He wakes up in Techno’s arms, his head pillowed on Techno’s chest, Techno’s hand in his hair. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>These fuckers sure are touchy, aren’t they? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy picks his head up and gives Techno a sour glare. “I’m not a fucking cat.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno smiles at him, “I dunno, I think I make a pretty good Bond villain.” He strokes Tommy’s hair exaggeratedly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy scowls and bats at his hand. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno smirks at him, smug bastard, but he at least puts his hand on Tommy’s shoulder instead. “You seem a bit more alive than you’ve been the past few days.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy blinks. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Days?” </span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno frowns, “you’ve been pretty sick, kid. We’ve been worried.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy sits up, his head spins, but it isn’t as bad as it was before. “Shit,” he mutters to himself, raising a hand to his forehead. Techno’s hand hovers at his elbow, ready to catch him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He ignores it, looking around the room. The TV is playing something, soft and quiet, the screen flashing with colors and motion. Someone is...dancing? Singing? Tommy doesn’t know. He doesn’t really care. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The window is what he’s after. Its daylight out, he doesn’t know what time just by looking. His mouth feels dry and musty, he feels gross. He wants a shower. “Can I take a shower?” he asks, “then I’ll get out of you guys’ hair. Thanks for taking care of me and shit.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno’s face does an odd thing, then he’s blank. “I’ll turn on the shower for you and grab you some clothes.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you.” Tommy stretches, his joints still ache and his head is still stuffed and pounding with pain, but he feels more like an actual human being than a corpse now. He can’t mooch off the Craft’s any more. Even though he desperately wants to tuck himself back into Techno’s arms. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He can’t be too much. He has to be independent, strong. He can’t rely on anyone but himself, and that’s fine. He’s lived that way for all his life. It was nice of the Crafts to put up with him but now he needs to go back to the real world. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno grunts at him as he goes by so Tommy assumes the shower is on and he stumbles his way to the bathroom. Yeah, he’s definitely still sick, but he’s not </span>
  <em>
    <span>dying</span>
  </em>
  <span> he’ll be fine. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He reluctantly sheds the fuzzy robe, he is going to miss that thing, and steps into the water. He doesn’t want to take any of their soap or anything so he just scrubs down in the water as well as he can. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Clothes on the counter,” Techno calls and then Tommy can just catch the sound of the door closing over the water. He sighs. He wants to fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>live</span>
  </em>
  <span> in this shower. In this house. With them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>But he can’t. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s got to go. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He rests his head against the wall, letting the water pound on his back for just a moment more. He takes as deep a breath as he can manage with his stuffed nose and hits the button to turn off the shower. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The clothes Techno brought him are...definitely not his. They look like more of Wilbur’s clothes. Did he just dream them stealing his shit? He also definitely can’t leave the house in these, those are </span>
  <em>
    <span>fully</span>
  </em>
  <span> pyjama pants. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Its not like he’s going to change into the stuff he just got out of though. He rolls up the too-long cuffs of the pants and just accepts that sweater paws are his fate. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Motivated by some fuzzy memory of Phil fucking drying his hair for him, he scrubs over his head with a towel and leaves it in the mess that results. Fuck it. He’s tired. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He steps back into Phil’s room and the man himself is waiting for him there. He gets a beaming grin as soon as Phil realizes he’s there. “Hey mate. You really </span>
  <em>
    <span>are</span>
  </em>
  <span> looking more alive. Upright and everything. How do you feel?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy bobs his head, “better, big man, thanks for. You know, putting up with me and shit. It was really nice of you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fuck this is awkward. How is he supposed to be cool about this? This is literally the nicest thing anyone has ever done for him and he just wants to stay in the moment, in the house, forever. But he knows the resentment will start building up before long. It always does. He should consider himself lucky that they were willing to do as much as they did. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s always been greedy, grasping, clinging to any hint of affection shown to him. He can’t be like that, not with them. They’d probably think he was only after their money or some shit and then they’d drop him like a hot fucking potato. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil rests his hands on Tommy’s shoulders and steers him towards the bed though. “You don’t have to thank us,” he says, “we’re happy to have you here with us.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Belatedly, Tommy realizes that Phil is trying to tuck him back into bed. “I really should go,” he says, resisting the gentle hands. “I don’t want to--” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nonsense,” Phil says, “I know you say you feel better but you’re still sick. You need more rest. Just lay down.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll be fine,” Tommy insists, “really big man, I’m sure you guys have better things to do than babysit me.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then Phil fucking grabs his chin. Like some cartoon villain. What the </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck?</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy is so shocked by the move that he lets Phil turn his head so he’s looking at him. People </span>
  <em>
    <span>actually</span>
  </em>
  <span> grab other people by the chin? Is this a rich person thing?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Never,” Phil says, "Nothing could ever be more important than taking care of you, Toms.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy blinks at him with wide eyes. This is. Intense. Far more intense than he was prepared for. What the fuck.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Uh,” he manages. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil smiles at him and drops his hand, “sorry. I know we probably seem a bit smothering. We take sickness seriously around here.” He sits beside Tommy on the bed, pulling him under one arm. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy kind of wants him to...not. Do that. But he looks...weird. Melancholy, wistful, but in a sad way. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“My wife,” Phil says softly, “got sick, and we thought it was nothing at first but. Well. She didn’t get better.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oh shit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>This is so much more intense than Tommy is prepared for, but it makes sense that they’re freaking out about someone they know being sick. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m sorry,” he says softly, what else is he supposed to say here? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil smiles softly at him, “she would have loved you. I know we seem overbearing, but please, stay just a little longer? Just until you feel better.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I--” Fuck what the fuck is he supposed to say? Phil is acting like its some great favor Tommy’s doing by letting them hover over them. This isn’t the way things work, this isn’t the way things go. Not for him. “Okay.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>What else could he possibly say? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil’s smile brightens, “thanks mate. It means a lot.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah.” Tommy says, stilted, “you uh. I-- thank you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil brushes his wet hair back behind his ear, “we’re happy to do it. Now how about I get you some more meds? You could use more rest.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy swallows down a dose of the disgusting tasting medicine under Phil’s careful watch and he’s tucked back under the covers, Phil sitting beside him, watching over him. “Sleep well,” Phil murmurs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy hums and closes his eyes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>***</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wakes up to the sound of Wilbur’s guitar, periodically interrupted with a tsk or a sigh. Tommy knows the sound of Wilbur composing, its always been kind of...special, that Wilbur is okay with doing it while Tommy is there. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy sure as fuck wouldn’t want some dumb kid around while he’s trying to do Art and shit. Especially when he’s fucking it up. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not that Wilbur is </span>
  <em>
    <span>bad</span>
  </em>
  <span> at it or anything. Even his practices and composing sessions are amazing, but its still not as polished as the final piece. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy turns over and opens his eyes. He can see the body of Wilbur’s guitar, cradled in his lap as he leans over it to scrawl something in the notebook on the bed in front of him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He still feels hazy from the medicine and its really tempting to reach out and touch Wilbur’s guitar. Its shiny and shit. But he knows better, Wilbur talks about that thing like its his fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>baby</span>
  </em>
  <span> and handles it like its made of solid gold and spun glass at the same time. No way would Tommy ever touch it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur finishes writing and sticks his pencil back behind his ear, sitting up to strum at the guitar again. Its a soft melody, something mellow and sweet. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“S’ pretty,” Tommy mutters. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur pauses, “well look who woke up.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy grunts and props himself up on an elbow. “What’s that one? I haven’t heard it before?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Its new,” Wilbur says, “I wanted to try a lullaby for once. You like it?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy nods, “its--” he yawns, “It’s good, man.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You always say that,” Wilbur teases. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And I’m always right, I am a fucking entrepreneur of music.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You mean a connoisseur?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy shrugs and waves a careless hand, “that too,” he mutters.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur laughs softly and goes back to playing. Tommy balls up the pillow under his head so he can lay down but still watch. He tracks Wilbur's fingers across the strings. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Its hypnotizing, watching the way they dance across the neck of the guitar, coaxing different sounds from it. “You’re really good,” Tommy mutters vaguely. He can’t quite think of the words to really encompass how good Wilbur is. How cool he is. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur smiles at him and his fingers fly over the guitar with an artistic flourish. “Oh that was good actually,” he mutters, pausing to make another note. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy snorts. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur flashes him a grin and rests his elbow on the guitar. “Phil said you were feeling a bit better, I’m glad he was right.” He reaches out and brushes back a lock of Tommy’s hair. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Its a little less annoying now that Tommy knows this is a whole...</span>
  <em>
    <span>thing</span>
  </em>
  <span> for them. He doesn’t know how old Wilbur was when his mom died but there’s probably no age that’s good for watching someone wither away to a sickness you can’t stop. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy didn’t even ever know his mom and he still misses her some days. The idea of her at least. She probably wouldn’t actually be as great as he’s built her up to be in his head, but it was still a fantasy that got him through a lot of hopeless nights. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The thought of her coming back, declaring that giving him up or losing him or whatever the fuck happened was a terrible mistake. That she’s been looking for him, that she wants him and then taking him with her into the happy sunset. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Realistically, she is either dead, or not all that fond of kids. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil said his wife would have liked him though. Tommy wonders if he’s right. She was probably a good mom, like Phil is a good dad. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He doesn't even </span>
  <em>
    <span>yell</span>
  </em>
  <span> at Wilbur and Techno, much less hit them.   </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sunshine?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy jerks himself out of his thoughts. “Huh?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was asking if you felt up to eating something,” Wilbur says, “its been awhile since you threw up.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh, uh.” He’s actually kind of hungry. “Yeah, I can--” he starts to sit up but Wilbur grabs him by the shoulder. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, lay down, come on, I can get it for you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Its fine,” Tommy says, “you don’t have to.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want to,” Wilbur says. Then he smiles mischievously, “or we can just make Techno do it.” He grabs his phone from beside the notepad and types something into it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Soup is on its way,” he says, clearly satisfied. “And neither of us had to lift a finger.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You had to lift your fingers a lot, actually,” Tommy mutters and mimes typing on the phone. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur snorts. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno appears a minute later, a tray with a steaming bowl and a sleeve of crackers in his hands. “Soup delivery,” he intones. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank you,” Tommy mutters, guilt curling in his chest. Techno was probably doing something important, or at least doing his own thing, taking a break from having to watch over Tommy, and he pulled him back here. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sit up,” Techno says, “you don’t want to spill.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur is already adjusting the pillows behind his head, like he’s some fucking old person. Tommy scowls at him and then he remembers the whole Dead Mom Thing. Its probably habit or some shit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wipes the scowl off his face and lets Wilbur fuss with the blanket too. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno sets the tray over his lap and takes the opportunity to ruffle Tommy’s hair. Tommy has no hesitation about scowling at him. Techno’s lip quirks. “Eat up,” he commands, then turns to Wilbur, “you, move.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I think the fuck not,” Wibur sniffs. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I want to watch TV, scoot.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Its my turn to sit with Tommy,” Wilbur protests. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah well you should have thought about that before you made me bring him soup. Now its my turn.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I could have gotten it,” Tommy mutters, guilt curling even more tightly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno puts a hand on his head and uses it to make Tommy look at him. “I didn’t mind,” he says, “I’m happy to get you soup. But I am going to give Wilbur shit for it.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey!”</span>

  <span>He ends up having one of them at his bedside pretty much all the time. Even Phil comes in and checks on him frequently. Tommy knows that he’s got a fucking shitload of work and he doesn’t know what to think about the times that Phil actually sits with him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Sometimes he wakes up and all three of them are there, hovering over him like he’s on death’s door. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It gets less and less endearing as he recovers. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Don’t get him wrong. He gets it, he </span>
  <em>
    <span>does,</span>
  </em>
  <span> the whole Dead Mom Thing that he’s not touching with a hundred foot pole. But he’s going to have to leave at some point and they are making it </span>
  <em>
    <span>so fucking hard</span>
  </em>
  <span> for him to remember that. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He wants to stay here forever, but he can’t. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s got his own shitty apartment, his own shitty life, to get back to. He doesn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>need</span>
  </em>
  <span> anyone, he doesn’t need this place, these people. He vowed the day he left his last foster house that it was just a ‘me, myself, and I’ life for him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>No more laying himself at the feet of people who didn’t give a shit about him. No more taking shit from people who pretended to care about him. No more beaten dog whining when yet another family turned out to be shit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Everyone hates Tommy eventually, if he gives them enough time. So he just won’t. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’ll go back to his shit apartment and it’ll be hard, and he’ll definitely cry himself to sleep at </span>
  <em>
    <span>least</span>
  </em>
  <span> once but it’ll be better than letting the Craft’s shatter his fucking heart. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So the whole clingy act is getting. Tiring. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The hair petting, the arms around his shoulders, the </span>
  <em>
    <span>cuddling</span>
  </em>
  <span> on the bed while they watch movies. It can’t last. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Some dumb fuck once said something about how it was better to lose love than to never have it and Tommy can confirm that guy is a fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>idiot.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>It would be better if he never knew this existed. Then it would be easy to pry himself out of their arms. How the fuck is he supposed to give this up? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Part of him wants to be stupid and stubborn and petulant and just refuse to leave until they physically drag him out and lock the door behind him. He’s tried that before though, it’s never any better than leaving under his own power. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Comfort, safety, </span>
  <em>
    <span>love,</span>
  </em>
  <span> poisoned by resentment are worse than never having those things at all. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Besides, he’s getting tired of being cooped up in Phil’s room. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Not that Wilbur seems convinced by this argument. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I need </span>
  <em>
    <span>enrichment,</span>
  </em>
  <span> big man! Or I’ll go wild, like a fuckin’ animal! I’ll tear your head off if you leave me in here long enough. I want to </span>
  <em>
    <span>move,</span>
  </em>
  <span> I want to </span>
  <em>
    <span>see things</span>
  </em>
  <span> besides your ugly face.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur raises an eyebrow. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re still--” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I am </span>
  <em>
    <span>barely</span>
  </em>
  <span> stuffy!” Tommy groans. “My head doesn’t hurt, I haven’t thrown up since that one night, I’m </span>
  <em>
    <span>fine!”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur crosses his arms. “We just want to be sure--” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy groans, “I’m </span>
  <em>
    <span>fine!</span>
  </em>
  <span> I promise you walking around the house won’t k--” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shit, wait. The Dead Mom thing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Walking around the house won’t be the end of the world,” Tommy amends hastily. “I’ll even come back, </span>
  <em>
    <span>please.” </span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He definitely doesn’t whine. Or give Wilbur puppy-dog eyes. He would never. He’s a Big Man. He does flop over, letting himself hang off the edge of the bed, the closest he can get to actually leaving the damn thing. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The door opens. “Why is Tommy melting?” Techno asks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m withering away from lack of exercise,” Tommy informs him, “Wilbur is stifling me. Free me Techno.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno grunts. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sit up,” Wilbur fusses, “you’re going to fall out and crack your skull.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh my </span>
  <em>
    <span>god</span>
  </em>
  <span> its like three inches to the floor,” Tommy groans. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sit up,” Techno says, “I’ll check your temperature and we’ll see how ‘better’ you really are.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy pops up straight again. Oh shit, head rush. He wobbles a bit, but he’s fine. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno presses a button on the thermometer and Tommy obediently opens his mouth for him to stick it in. He crosses his eyes, trying to read the numbers but Techno flicks his nose. “Your eyes’ll get stuck like that.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I woul’ ‘ill be more han’ome ‘an Wil’ur” Tommy mutters. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That isn’t hard to do,” Techno says. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur squawks in the background, but his opinion isn’t important. The thermometer beeps and Techno pulls it out of his mouth. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy leans forward, trying to catch the reading but Techno holds it too high. “You’re still running a fever,” he says. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bullshit!” Tommy yelps. “There’s no fucking way!” he presses a hand to his forehead. It doesn’t feel warm. “I think your thermometer is broken, big man.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You want me to call Phil in here to check?” Techno asks, a single eyebrow raised. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy sighs heavily. No, he doesn’t want them to disturb whatever work Phil is doing. He’s been doing a lot of it lately. Lots of phone calls. Tommy heard him on one when he was waking up the other day. It sounded intense. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He thinks Phil’s trying to do some business merging shit, there was a lot of talk about paperwork and ‘adopting’ something or other. He’d been saying something about an ‘adjustment period’ when he realized Tommy was awake and then he’d ended the call. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy already feels bad enough about that, he’s not pulling Phil away from stuff again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lay back down,” Techno commands. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy crosses his arms and glares up at him, “I think you are lying,” he declares boldly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mhm,” Techno says, and then he shoves Tommy’s shoulder and lets him fall back onto the pillows. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy groans, “I can’t even walk around?” He maybe-possibly whines a little bit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno eyes him critically. “How about you come sit on the couch in the lounge for a bit instead.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Techno!” Wilbur protests. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He needs a change of scenery,” Techno says, “you wanna have him trying to escape, or you want to go the easy route?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur scowls at him, “he’s going to try and escape from the couch.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’ll both sit with him,” Techno says, “he can watch me play for a bit, </span>
  <em>
    <span>maybe</span>
  </em>
  <span> if he’s good I’ll even let him be player two.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“If I’m </span>
  <em>
    <span>good,</span>
  </em>
  <span> bitch!?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy is soundly ignored. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fine,” Wilbur hisses, “but if he </span>
  <em>
    <span>gets worse</span>
  </em>
  <span>, then I’m blaming you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He won’t,” Techno says simply. “We’ll watch him.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Thank fuck,” Tommy mutters, flinging the covers off and making a break for the edge of the bed. His feet touch the rug. And then they lift off of it because Techno has </span>
  <em>
    <span>picked him up. </span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What the </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck!?”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Tommy squeaks--bellows. He bellows. Like a man. He is incapable of squeaking. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur piles blankets on top of him and Techno is </span>
  <em>
    <span>carrying him,</span>
  </em>
  <span> in his arms </span>
  <em>
    <span>like a baby</span>
  </em>
  <span> and he isn’t letting go. “Put me the fuck down!” Tommy demands. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hm. No.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy sputters, “that--that wasn’t a fucking--a request, dickhead. Put me down.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They’re crossing Phil’s room in a couple of easy strides, and Wilbur is at the door, fussing with the handle. Techno has to pause for a second while he opens it and then he carries Tommy down the hall. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t help but notice you’re still carrying me,” Tommy says, glaring at Techno. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t help but notice you’re still sick,” Techno says simply. “This is the compromise. You get to go to the lounge, but you’re not overdoing yourself. Accept it, or I can take you back to bed.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy crosses his arms and glares silently, but he doesn’t complain. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Thankfully it isn’t </span>
  <em>
    <span>too</span>
  </em>
  <span> far to the lounge. For the size of their stupid rich-bitch house at least. But as Techno carries him through one of the more ‘public’ areas of the house--he’s taking a weird route for some reason--Tommy notices something odd. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Did you guys change your fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>door?</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s never heard of someone replacing their door. Presumably it </span>
  <em>
    <span>happens</span>
  </em>
  <span> because he’s been to a hardware store once--one of the big ones, and they had like. A rack of doors and it was kind of cool honestly--no, focus. They </span>
  <em>
    <span>sell</span>
  </em>
  <span> doors so obviously people had to be buying them but Tommy’s never seen it. As far as he knew people just kind of lived with it if their door broke. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>No, wait, the door is the same, its the handle that’s changed, there’s a fancy new lock, why the fuck--</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno spins him away from the door and brings him through another doorway to the lounge. Which is literally just another living room but apparently this one is </span>
  <em>
    <span>different</span>
  </em>
  <span> because its in the more “private” areas of the house or some shit. Techno lowers him to the couch. Tommy barely has time to be free before Wilbur is on him with a fucking blanket. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh my god are you serious?” Tommy demands. “I’m not gonna </span>
  <em>
    <span>freeze!”</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t need to be wasting energy on keeping warm,” Wilbur says as if there is anything in any way logical about this nonsense. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy throws the blankets off, “I’m too hot, let me be free.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur makes an unhappy noise and throws them back over him. Tommy flings them off again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur puts them on again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I will kill you,” Tommy says, throwing them off. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll burrito you like an angry cat,” Wilbur counters. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’d like to see you fucking try.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur lunges for him. Tommy scrambles off the couch and onto his feet. Fucking finally. He’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>free.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He bounds out of reach, laughing hysterically. He definitely isn’t going to be able to keep this up for long but he’s so </span>
  <em>
    <span>tired</span>
  </em>
  <span> of laying around. He doesn’t give a shit if he crashes after this, he wants to </span>
  <em>
    <span>move.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tommy come back,” Wilbur demands. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’ll never take me alive!” Tommy declares and he ducks into the kitchen--there’s a pot of soup on the stove fuck how much soup did they </span>
  <em>
    <span>make</span>
  </em>
  <span> if there’s still that much left?--and out the other side, into the big empty room/hall situation near the stairs that Tommy is sure has a dumb rich people name that he doesn’t care to learn. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He pauses, already panting as he tries to map where he should go next. There’s a thump behind him and Wilbur skids into the room, blanket in his hands like a fucking net. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tommy,” he says warningly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Viva la resistance!” Tommy screeches and vaults over the stupid decorative table thing and up the stairs. He can hear Wilbur cursing and rushing after him. Shit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He takes the first right, Phil’s office is on the left side of the upstairs so he’ll have to loop around and go back down as quietly as possible. Without Wilbur catching him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Easy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Hopefully. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His socks slip on the stupid tile floors as he bolts around a corner, Wilbur hot on his heels. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Gremlin,” Wilbur growls, “get back here.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Never!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fuck Wilbur is fast. Tommy squeaks as Wilbur’s hand just barely misses catching him by the collar of Techno’s stupid robe--which he is still wearing, no he is never giving it back. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then a door opens in front of them. Its not Phil’s office, but Phil comes out of it. Phil looks up, his eyes widening as he sees them bolting towards him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Ha! </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Phil!” Tommy shouts, “Phil help, he’s trying to burrito me!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He skids to a stop, hiding behind Phil, panting breathlessly as he laughs. “Suck it bitch.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur stops too, glaring at him. He doesn’t seem in the least bit tired. Bitch that he is. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What’s all this then?” Phil asks mock sternly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tommy,” Wilbur says, pointing an accusing finger at him, “isn’t resting. Techno let him sit on the couch but he’s running around instead.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Wilbur,”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Tommy argues, “is being a mother hen. I’m hot. I don’t want blankets. I’m tired of just sitting around being sick, I want to get up and </span>
  <em>
    <span>move.</span>
  </em>
  <span>” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well,” Phil says, “now you’ve moved. Let’s get you back down to the couch. Wilbur, if he doesn’t want blankets he doesn’t have to be under blankets. I know you’re worried but don’t be </span>
  <em>
    <span>too</span>
  </em>
  <span> overbearing mate. We’re all happy to have Tommy here but he </span>
  <em>
    <span>is</span>
  </em>
  <span> still allowed to do his own thing sometimes.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy sticks his tongue out at Wilbur from behind Phil. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur gapes, making an offended noise, “Dad, he--” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wilbur,” Phil says, “how old are you?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur subsides with a grumble and a glare. Tommy gives him the smugest fucking smile he can manage. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on mate,” Phil says, directing him by the shoulder, “you’ve had enough exercise I think. How’s your fever doing?” he puts a hand on Tommy’s forehead. “Hm, better, I think.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I fucking knew it,” Tommy growls, “that thermometer is fucking broken.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Techno said he was still running a fever,” Wilbur says, like a fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>snitch.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well, you were just running around, that probably cooled down your skin a bit,” Phil says, “we’ll trust the technology, come on, couch. I’ll get some medicine.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No,” Tommy whines, “that stuff is gross. I’m not taking any more. I’m </span>
  <em>
    <span>barely</span>
  </em>
  <span> sick, I don’t need medicine.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil nudges him ahead of him and Tommy skulks back towards the stairs, Techno is waiting for him at the bottom. “Brat,” he says. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bitch,” Tommy replies. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil snorts behind him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno snatches him up as soon as he’s in range. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Phiiil,” Tommy whines, “tell him to put me </span>
  <em>
    <span>down!</span>
  </em>
  <span> I’m not a fucking baby!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Techno,” Phil says, “let him walk. He wants exercise, he can exercise in the house.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno grunts, but he actually does put Tommy back down. Tommy jumps a few steps away from him. “Yeah bitch! I can do what I want!”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I said you could exercise in the house,” Phil chimes in, “that is not the same thing. And you’re still supposed to be resting until you’ve kicked this entirely mate, don’t get ahead of yourself.” </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Ugh.</span>
  </em>
  <span> They’re </span>
  <em>
    <span>all</span>
  </em>
  <span> mother hens. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m a big man, you can’t stop me.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Want to bet?” Wilbur asks cattily. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy spins around to glare at him, “I could kick your ass!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You forget,” Techno says, “you’re outnumbered. Maybe you could get away from one of us, but all three? Best to just give in, runt.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Bitch,” Tommy says. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil laughs again and presses Tommy down onto the couch by his shoulder. “Lay down mate, I’ll get your medicine.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not taking it,” Tommy says, because at some point that shit has to be bad for you. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes you are,” Techno says, like his opinion matters. “You will rest and take your medicine until the doctor gives you the all clear.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy blinks at him, “You get a fucking doctorate while I wasn’t looking big man?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Technically I have several, but no medical degree. Phil’s been consulting with the family physician about your case.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What the fuck?!” Tommy demands, “Isn’t that against like? The hypocrite oath?!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The hippocratic oath,” Techno says, “and technically modern medical professionals aren’t bound to it. More importantly, Phil asking our doctor about you being sick doesn’t violate patient privacy.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I feel like it kind of does,” Tommy mutters, but Techno apparently knows a shit ton about doctor stuff for a guy who doesn’t have a degree so maybe it doesn’t. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Come on mate,” Phil says, coming back into the livingroom with a bowl in one hand and the bottle of medicine in the other. Tommy scowls at him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not taking any more medicine. You’ll have to hold me down like a cat.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t tempt me,” Techno mutters as he sits in the armchair next to the couch. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur snorts, flopping himself down on the couch at Tommy’s feet. Tommy kicks him. Wilbur wraps the blanket around his legs up to his knees. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You kicked me!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re in my bubble!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Your bubble,” Wilbur says flatly, “what are you, six?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m old enough to defend my fucking bubble!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tommy take your medicine, Wilbur get out of his bubble.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Phiiil,” they whine in unison. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil sighs and rolls his eyes but he’s smiling. “I mean it. Medicine. Bubble. Let him adjust, mate, this is a big change.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>That’s….kind of a weird thing to say. Tommy squints his eyes, but neither Techno nor Wilbur seem to have any questions about what the fuck Phil means. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Weird.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Meds,” Phil says, pouring the liquid into the little cup and holding it out to him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tommy,” Phil sighs, “its for your own good mate.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Its gross, and I don’t need it,” Tommy argues. “My immune system is the strongest in the world, I am undefeated--” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You just spent a week being extremely sick,” Techno says dryly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“--Any evidence you may or may not have to the contrary is fake news, spread by my enemies to make me seem weak.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil looks him in the eye, waiting. But there is a fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>limit</span>
  </em>
  <span> to how far they can skate on the whole Dead Mom/Wife Thing and this is it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil watches him for a moment, but Tommy only lifts his chin. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Alright, later then,” Phil says, “but you will be taking it.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I won’t,” Tommy says a little testily. “I’m fine. I should honestly be heading out soon. Got big man shit to do.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Like finding a job. And making sure that nobody’s squatting in his apartment. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil’s face does something...weird. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The air seems tense. Tommy glances to Techno and Wilbur. They’re both watching Phil. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mate,” Phil says slowly, carefully. “There’s something I’ve been wanting to talk to you about.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” Tommy asks warily. This is it, this’ll be it. They’re glad he’s leaving, good on him, pulling himself up by his bootstraps and shit. You can leave now Tommy, don’t come back. It was nice while it lasted but we’re tired of you now. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil sits on the coffee table in front of him, nudging the bowl of soup out of the way. He folds his hands together, dangling between his knees. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You know we love you,” he say. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oh yeah, here it comes. Tommy’s heard this one before. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re a delight to have around mate,” Phil continues. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His clothes are probably washed by now, he can grab Henry out of Pihl’s room and change in there. Give Techno back his robe. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You bring so much light to the house, to all of us.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Did he bring his phone? He doesn’t remember having it but he does sort of remember Phil asking him to unlock it? Maybe? Was that just a fever dream? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will has been so much happier since he found you, Techno too, and me. You make us all so happy, Toms.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>So, clothes, Henry, blanket, possibly phone. Does he have shoes? He doesn’t remember. That’ll be a fucking pain to walk back to his apartment barefoot. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You fit in so well, like you were always meant to be here. You’re part of the family, I really, truly mean it.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Maybe he could borrow an old pair from Will? No, that’s probably asking too much. He definitely couldn’t afford to buy a pair off him, even used.  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We want you to stay.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>What?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” Tommy croaks. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil looks at him, his face is--is soft. And loving. And Tommy can’t help but flick a glance behind himself to see who he’s looking at. But there’s just Tommy. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He leans forward and cups Tommy’s face in his hands. “We want you to stay, with us. Forever,” Phil says. “Be ours, Tommy.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” Tommy croaks again. “I don’t--you can’t--you don’t mean that.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur makes a wounded noise from the couch beside him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I do,” Phil says. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You can’t,” Tommy mangoes to say. “I’m not--” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s not the kind of person people want to </span>
  <em>
    <span>stay.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You are </span>
  <em>
    <span>wonderful,</span>
  </em>
  <span>” Phil says, stroking a thumb over his cheek. “We </span>
  <em>
    <span>love you.</span>
  </em>
  <span> We want you to stay. We want you to be ours.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>This is--</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This is just </span>
  <em>
    <span>mean.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy jerks away. “No. You’re--” He takes a deep breath. “You don’t--I’m not the person you want. You can find some other kid, you’ll like them better. I’m just gonna go.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He takes a step towards the door. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno rises in front of him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tommy,” he says. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Techno, move.” Tommy mangages, keeping his eyes down. He can’t bear to look any of them in the face. He takes a step to the side. Techno matches him. </span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Tommy,” </span>
  </em>
  <span>he says again. He lifts Tommy’s chin. “You’re not leaving.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Look--” Tommy begins, “I get that you guys are--are nice and shit but I’m not--I’m a big man. Gotta do my own thing, you know? It was nice of you to ask and all but I won’t be a good fi--I’ve got women to talk to, and--and--” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We weren’t asking.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy freezes. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We weren’t asking,” Techno says. “We were </span>
  <em>
    <span>informing </span>
  </em>
  <span>you, that you were staying.” </span>

  <p>
  <span>“Uh,” Tommy says, he laughs nervously and takes a step back. “What are you--what the fuck is that supposed to </span>
  <em>
    <span>mean?”</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>A hand wraps around the back of his neck, like a cat scruffing a kitten. “Techno’s bad at explaining,” Wilbur coos sweetly, “why don’t you sit back down and we’ll talk about it Toms.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His heart flutters. This is--this is just some weird rich people thing. They say all sorts of weird shit all the time. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re kind of freaking me out,” Tommy says softly. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You don’t need to be scared,” Phil chimes in, he stands at Tommy’s other side. He’s blocked in the front by Techno, from behind and to the left by Wilbur, to the right by Phil. He’s hemmed in on all sides by them. “We would never hurt you, you know that Tommy.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I--” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We want to take care of you,” Wilbur croons, “forever. You’re just a little child, you need someone to do it.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m an adult, big man,” Tommy says weakly, “got papers and everything.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Forgeries,” Phil laughs, “not even very good ones.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>When the </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck</span>
  </em>
  <span> did Phil see his paperwork? </span>
  <em>
    <span>Why </span>
  </em>
  <span>the fuck was he looking at his paperwork? </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You’re barely sixteen,” Phil murmurs, his arm wraps around Tommy’s shoulders. Like a snake, like one of those boa constrictors or some shit. Tommy can’t breathe. “And you haven’t been taking good care of yourself. So we’re gonna do it now.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I--you can’t.” Tommy says. His breath hitches as Wilbur’s hand, Phil’s arm, tighten around him. Techno takes a step closer. Tommy tries to flinch back but there’s nowhere to go. His breath hitches. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Can’t what?” Techno asks, amusement in his voice, “take you away? Theseus, nobody knows where you are. You ran away from foster care, you got fired from your job, your apartment? Your landlord has already forgotten your name. Nobody has asked questions about where you’ve gone. Nobody is </span>
  <em>
    <span>going to.”</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fear curls in his gut. Tommy swallows hard. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nobody cares about you,” Wilbur murmurs, his cheek rests against Tommy’s temple. Tommy flinches. “Nobody but us.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And we care </span>
  <em>
    <span>so much</span>
  </em>
  <span> about you, sunshine,” Phil says, rubbing Tommy’s shoulder. “I know you’re used to being on your own, to having to take care of yourself, but you don’t have to do that anymore. We’ll take care of you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Let me go,” Tommy says, his voice shaky and soft. “Let me go I can’t--” He breaks off with a hitched gasp. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sit down, gremlin,” Wilbur says, pushing at him. Tommy is forced to shuffle a step back. Another. The back of his calves hits the couch. Wilbur presses him down. “You’re okay,” Wilbur coos, “you’re alright, we’ve got you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t--” Tommy hisses, flinching away from him, “don’t touch me. I don’t know what kind of fucking joke this is but its </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> funny. Stop.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He desperately searches Wilbur’s face for some hint of humor. “Sunshine, we’d never joke about loving you,” Wilbur croons. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Stop it! Stop calling me that, stop being--just stop!” Tommy holds a hand up as if he could ward off the terrifyingly intent look in Wilbur’s eye. He looks desperately around, Techno and Phil are still hovering close by. Too close. They’re all too close. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They’re fucking--they’re kidnapping him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Oh fuck this is a kidnapping. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s heard about this shit but he never thought--he never considered--he has to get out of here. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He whips around and scrambles over the back of the couch. He drops to the floor, shoulder first as Phil, Techno, and Wilbur start moving behind him. He can hear them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno was right, he is outnumbered. Fuck. </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He scrabbles over the tile--fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>socks--</span>
  </em>
  <span>and gets to his feet. He bolts for the next room. Upstairs is a bad idea. But there’s a back door. Through the hall. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tommy!” Phil calls. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno doesn’t say anything, but Tommy can practically </span>
  <em>
    <span>sense</span>
  </em>
  <span> him right on his heels. Feel the heat of his breath on the back of his neck, the weight of his eyes, locked onto his prey. That’s what Tommy is. Prey. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He whimpers and knocks over a chair at the dining table in his wake. It won’t be enough. Fuck. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>The back door! Its there! There it is!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy slams into it. Ouch. Fuck. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>No, it doesn’t matter, just get it open. Get it open. Why isn’t it opening? </span>
  <em>
    <span>Why won’t it open?</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He fumbles with the handle, twisting turning, he smacks the door desperately. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Just work! </span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Arms wrap around him. Tommy screams. Bloody murder beause he’s pretty sure that one is about to happen oh gods. Oh </span>
  <em>
    <span>gods,</span>
  </em>
  <span> he’s gonna die. He was a fucking idiot to trust them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His feet are lifted clear of the floor, he kicks, hits the door, hits someone’s legs. Techno grunts. Oh fuck its Techno. Techno is so much stronger than him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy screams again and twists at the waist, clawing at what parts of Techno he can reach. Mostly just his shoulder and a little bit of his neck. Fuck, fuck, fuck. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Someone grab his hands please,” Techno growls.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No!” Tommy screeches, “Don’t! Fucking don’t you dare--I’ll--I’m gonna fucking--” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur is coming closer. No, no,</span>
  <em>
    <span> nononononono.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy lunges for him, he has to get him to back off. He swipes at the air, punches, kicks. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Bites. </span>
  </em>
  <span>But somehow Wilbur dodges him and then he has one wrist. The other. Tommy is trapped, leaned out from Techno’s arms, Wilbur holding his wrists. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He pants heavily, chest heaving. He can’t fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>breathe.</span>
  </em>
  <span> He’s so </span>
  <em>
    <span>tired.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s so scared. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Easy mate,” Phil says, Tommy stiffens, flinches when he hears approaching footfalls. He tries to turn and look but Phil is approaching from the opposite side of Wilbur. Behind Tommy. “You’re okay, its alright.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I told you he’d run,” Techno grunts. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah, well maybe if you hadn’t worded things in the most </span>
  <em>
    <span>ominous fucking way possible,”</span>
  </em>
  <span> Wilbur says, “he wouldn’t have!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Boys, don’t argue, lets all just go back to the lounge and calm down a bit. ” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s a bit of shuffling and awkward maneuvering as Wilbur and Techno carry him to the lounge, but then they’re there. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tommy?” Phil says gently. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy flinches and shrinks away. Phil sounds closer. A hand touches his back. He takes a sharp breath, tensing his muscles as if they could protect him from a--a fucking knife or whatever the fuck they’re gonna kill him with. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Easy,” Phil murmurs, “just look at me mate, come on, let me see those eyes.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shakily, Tommy obeys. You’re supposed to do that right? Cooperate and make the murderer like you? One of his foster siblings was into True Crime he thought it was all bullshit he never </span>
  <em>
    <span>paid attention oh gods.</span>
  </em>
  <span> </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Its alright,” Phil coos, “look, I’m not going to hurt you,” he holds up his hands, like he’s surrendering. They’re empty, they’re just...Phil’s hands. Soft and gentle as they’ve always been. As he always thought they were, at least. Tommy shies away from them as they reach towards him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t,” he grits out, “I’ll--” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shh, look,” Phil says. Tommy squeezes his eyes shut and braces. Phil’s hand touches the top of his head, his breath hitches. Phil strokes down his hair, “see? Its just me mate, its just us, we’d never hurt you.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You fucking--you’re kidnapping me. You </span>
  <em>
    <span>already</span>
  </em>
  <span> kidnapped me,” Tommy snarls, ducking away from Phil’s hand. After a solid week of these fuckers touching his head his idiot brain says that the hand in his hair is nice, is good but it isn’t, it definitely fucking isn’t. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Phil agrees easily. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy...kind of expected him not to? He kind of expected some bullshit about how they’re just ‘reclaiming’ him or something. Or saving him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well--” he sputters, “I’m not--I’m not a fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>fan</span>
  </em>
  <span> of that.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We didn’t expect you to be,” Phil laughs, “there’ll be an adjustment period, you’ll try to escape, but you’ll settle down.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy thinks the fuck </span>
  <em>
    <span>not.</span>
  </em>
  <span> He will </span>
  <em>
    <span>not</span>
  </em>
  <span> be settling down, there will be no ‘try’ about his escape. He’s gonna Yoda that shit. Do or do not, but ‘do not’ isn’t even an option. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Techno,” Phil says, "let him down, you know he doesn’t like being picked up.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Phil,” Techno complains. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Techno.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy’s feet touch the carpet. He yanks away, bolting for the front door. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur stops him. Fuck. Wilbur. Wilbur still has his wrists. Tommy snarls and lunges for him. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Only Wilbur lets him go, and he takes a step back, his hands raised, like Phil. “Easy sunshine, I’m sorry, I’m sorry.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy hesitates, watching him warily. What fucking game are they playing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He catches motion from the corner of his eye. Techno. He spins on his heel, tense, ready, what’s he gonna--?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He is leaning, almost casually, against the wall next to the doorway. Blocking Tommy’s way to the front door. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy spins again. Phil is in front of him, guarding his path deeper into the house. He’s trapped. He’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>trapped,</span>
  </em>
  <span> they may not be touching him anymore but they don’t need to. He’s caged like a fucking animal. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>His breath hitches again. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tommy,” Phil says gently, “do you want to sit down? You’re still sick, you need rest.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy takes a massive step back, towards the wall. “No! No, fuck you! Get the fuck away from me!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m not moving,” Phil says, “see? Staying right here. I’ll even back up a step. Everything’s okay.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Every--no! No its fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>not!</span>
  </em>
  <span> Everything is bad! You kidnapped me! You’re gonna--you’re gonna fucking--” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We’re going to take care of you,” Wilbur says. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy chokes. Oh god, that’s some fucking mafia shit. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tommy, no,” Phil says, “not--” he laughs a little, like its ridiculous, “not </span>
  <em>
    <span>take care of you,</span>
  </em>
  <span> we’re going to </span>
  <em>
    <span>help</span>
  </em>
  <span> you. We’ll keep you safe, and warm and fed. Like we have all week, you liked it, didn’t you? You were so sweet Toms, so desperate for affection. You can have it, all you want and more.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy backs up another step. “You fucking drugged me. And you were--you were in my fucking </span>
  <em>
    <span>bubble.</span>
  </em>
  <span>” the words sound stupid, childish, but he doesn’t know how else to explain how...</span>
  <em>
    <span>touchy</span>
  </em>
  <span> they’ve been. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“We can back off,” Phil says, “if that’s what you want. Techno isn’t very tactile either. You just seemed to like it so much. I think you’re a little touch starved mate.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Fuck you!” Tommy snarls. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay,” Phil agrees easily. “I know you’re angry, and scared, that’s alright, you can fight us. You can try to escape, you can scream as loud as you’d like. You’ll settle down.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No I fucking won’t!” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil smiles at him, soft and fond and amused. “Okay mate, we’ll see which of us lasts longer. You, or us.” </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There is a sinking stone in Tommy’s gut that is already terrifyingly sure that it will be Phil who outlasts him. </span>
