<br/>
</p><p>The hall is decorated as if for a feast, and yet it is only Lan Xichen and Wen Ruohan in attendance, facing each other across a single table at the head of the hall, where the throne would normally be. Silk banners as tall as trees with gold and jade ornaments holding them in place drape the walls of the banquet hall, soaring towards the vaulted ceilings; the table groans under the weight of rare shellfish and the most expensive cuts of meat, cooked in fragrant spices, served on antique celadon plates.</p><p>Lan Xichen does not touch his chopsticks, nor lift his cup. Even the tea in Nightless City is offensive to him; he is always served zhengshan xiaozhang, a red tea that stinks of pinewood smoke.</p><p>“Is my hospitality not to your liking?” Wen Ruohan asks.</p><p>This is the game Wen Ruohan has chosen to play. Lan Xichen is a prisoner. Wherever he goes, he is escorted by armed guards, at least two of them cultivators; whenever he is in his quarters, the door is locked behind him. It is a lovely cage, gilded and lined with the finest silks, but a cage all the same.</p><p>Lan Xichen does not speak. He would close his eyes and attempt to meditate if he were not so wary of what Wen Ruohan might do while out of sight.</p><p>Wen Ruohan sighs as though Lan Xichen is an unruly disciple gossiping at the table.</p><p align="center">»»— ☼ —««</p><p>The Cloud Recesses burn, and Lan Xichen runs.</p><p>His father, burned. His uncle, beaten. His brother, broken.</p><p>The sacred texts of Gusu Lan are concealed in qiankun pouches, sewn into his innermost robe. Treasured above all other secrets of their sect; treasured above the lives of any single disciple. They do not weigh anything at all, and yet they are an impossible burden to carry.</p><p>Lan Qiren had ordered him to save the books, the scrolls. He had ordered him to abandon the disciples. There had been no time to argue, no time to question; Lan Xichen had simply obeyed.</p><p>He is not sure he would have the strength to choose. He is not sure he would choose differently if he did.</p><p>He runs.</p><p align="center">»»— ☼ —««</p><p>Lan Xichen’s cell in Nightless City is lushly appointed, distinct only from any other wealthy sect’s guest quarters by the bars on the window and the lock on the door. One of the windows faces east and catches the sunrise each morning, a ribbon of pale yellow light somehow breaking through the haze of Qishan and spilling across the floor. Lan Xichen kneels there and meditates, or tries to, every morning; he remains until the tremulous sunbeam completes its slow sweep across the floor and slides away again, into shadow.</p><p align="center">»»— ☼ —««</p><p>If they had thought to reach out to the local peasantry, perhaps Lan Xichen would have found succour; a distraction, at least, if not a place to hide, a chance to patch his wounds, supplies for the journey ahead. But the villagers here have no love of the Lan, who too often ignore their troubles with restless spirits and walking corpses in favour of seeking out more ambitious prey.</p><p>A boy, no older than sixteen or eighteen, finds Lan Xichen by the riverbank, lapping directly at the water like a dog, bloodied and filthy but still so clearly Lan in his pale robes, his silver ornaments. The boy – still growing and thin with it, coming into the fullness of what will one day be impressive height but for now looking like a flagpole in patched robes – looks at Xichen, startled, perhaps afraid, and runs.</p><p>Lan Xichen watches him go. He is, himself, tired of running. When he hears the shouts of Wen soldiers, the stamp of their boots, he draws Shuoyue.</p><p align="center">»»— ☼ —««</p><p>Wen Ruohan lifts his left hand, a slow gesture, as though moving through syrup instead of air. He crooks his fingers.</p><p>The shadows at the rear of the hall move, and Wen Ruohan’s concubine appears. He is, Lan Xichen supposes, a pretty creature; fine-boned, hair gleaming with oil and lightly dusted with gold powder, draped in robes so sheer they scarcely deserve the name. He sinks to his knees at Wen Ruohan’s side.</p><p>Wen Ruohan sets a hand on the boy’s head, stroking his hair in a lazy pattern. The boy rests his chin on Wen Ruohan’s thigh, careful to tilt his head so his immaculate face paint does not leave a mark on Wen Ruohan’s robes.</p><p>“Is he not beautiful?” Wen Ruohan asks. “Such a sweet creature. I call him Lianfang.”</p><p>Lan Xichen looks from the boy to Wen Ruohan. He does not wish to think of the boy, of how he came here, of if he was once a member of another sect. If he, too, has been taken from his home, from his family.</p><p>“His father,” Wen Ruohan says casually, reaching for one of the dishes in front of him, “is a fool. Lianfang’s mother was not his wife, you see, not even a concubine. He abandoned his son to preserve his reputation. Of course, Zewu-jun,” and here Wen Ruohan pauses, chopsticks closed around a jewel-bright slice of meat, still faintly dripping blood, “I suppose you, of anyone in this world, would understand what it is to have a father with a care for his reputation.”</p><p>Lan Xichen does not move. He does not blink. He does not clench his jaw, or clench his fists, or swallow. He keeps his eyes on Wen Ruohan’s smiling face, even as Wen Ruohan offers the boy his morsel, even as the boy takes it between his teeth.</p><p align="center">»»— ☼ —««</p><p>Lan Xichen – dizzy with exhaustion, with thirst, with fear – does not take in much of Nightless City. He perceives in moments, in sensations. The cold of stone under his knees. The shock of hot water against his skin. The harsh pulls of a comb through his hair.</p><p>A servant removes his forehead ribbon, and Xichen cannot even find the strength to protest. He wants to laugh when all they do is wash it and return it. His ribbon has seen much worse abuse than this in the past days. If it wasn’t profane, the servant’s actions might almost be courtesy.</p><p>They have not hurt him more than necessary to ensure his compliance. Wen Xu has, from time to time, mocked him, but he has not ordered Xichen branded or beaten, has not forced him into humiliating labours, has not taken liberties with his person. It is, Xichen knows, nothing more than luck that has saved him from those indignities. If Xichen was of lesser rank, or if Wen Chao had been sent to the Cloud Recesses…  </p><p>If all he has been required to tolerate is the repeated theft of his forehead ribbon – to be tied onto the tail of a mule, or used to polish a bit of leather, or wrapped around the hilt of a sword – then Xichen is blessed. Wen Xu even returned it to him at the end of their journey. It is fortunate. It <em>is.</em></p><p align="center">»»— ☼ —««</p><p>This is the game Wen Ruohan has chosen to play. He dines with Lan Xichen; not regularly, but often, and always with a table laden with such fine food that only a churl would refuse to eat. It is almost exclusively meat, and the rare vegetables are heavily spiced. Lan Xichen smiles and declines. Sometimes, Wen Ruohan and Lan Xichen are alone. Occasionally, they are joined by one or both of Wen Ruohan’s sons. Once, and once only, they are joined by Wen Zhuliu. More often, Wen Ruohan will summon Lianfang, not to dine with them, but to sit by Wen Ruohan’s feet, to lean against his thigh, to open his mouth and accept whatever sweetmeat or morsel Wen Ruohan chooses to give him.</p><p>To avoid making a study of Wen Ruohan, Lan Xichen makes a study of Lianfang. He is surely beautiful, although the paint makes it hard to know, his features obscured under a flawless plain of white powder. Where most courtesans and concubines would paint a huadian in the shape of a flower, Lianfang paints a stylised flame. His lips are always perfectly red, even when he eats or drinks with them; his eyes are always lined heavily with black.</p><p>It is obvious to anyone who cares to look that Lianfang makes Lan Xichen uncomfortable. This, he assumes, is why Wen Ruohan arranges for Lianfang to attend him every morning.</p><p align="center">»»— ☼ —««</p><p>When Lan Xichen imagined Wen Ruohan in his palace, he envisioned him high above his subjects, slouched in his throne like a villain in an opera. </p><p>Instead, Wen Ruohan stands before Lan Xichen, in the great hall with the rest of his retinue. His clothes are expensive, as befits the Chief Cultivator and Wen-zongzhu, but practical, as befits a cultivator who still walks the path of the sword. </p><p>Lan Xichen, kneeling with Wen Xu’s sword resting heavily on his shoulder, cannot see his face. </p><p>“Zewu-jun,” Wen Ruohan says. “I am honoured by your presence.”</p><p>Lan Xichen is not a gifted politician to begin with; he cannot imagine keeping track of the layers of meaning, of the strategic revelations and deceptions, when he is so depleted he can barely move. But he will not greet Wen Ruohan on his knees.</p><p>Slowly, with all the dignity he can muster, he gets his feet under him. He rises, the muscles of his thighs burning as he inches higher. Too slow and he will simply drop to his knees again; too fast and he may collapse onto Wen Ruohan. Neither would give the correct impression. Wen Xu chuckles, and lifts his sword away.</p><p>When Lan Xichen is standing on his own feet, he looks at Wen Ruohan. The Chief Cultivator is just a man, after all; a powerful man, and wealthy, and vicious, but just a man. </p><p>Lan Xichen speaks.</p><p>“Wen-xiandu.” His voice is little more than a whisper. That is well; he could not modulate himself now. Not faced with the man responsible for the destruction of his home. “As Lan An wrote, <em>Honour yourself and others will honour you</em>.”</p><p align="center">»»— ☼ —««</p><p>Wen Ruohan has audiences. It seems absurd; Wen Ruohan is infamous in the cultivation world for his unconcern with matters outside of his own immortality. Lan Xichen can only assume this is a show being put on for his benefit, yet another layer of obfuscation, of deniability, of story to be passed on. See, Zewu-jun: here is how we manage these things in Qishan.</p><p>Lan Xichen is invited to attend and kneels at Wen Ruohan’s right hand. Lianfang, as always, is at Wen Ruohan’s left. The boy has been given a task beyond looking beautiful today; he takes notes, hand flying over the parchment as this minor sect leader or that significant merchant speaks, leaving behind precise characters in his wake.</p><p>Wen Ruohan even consults with Lianfang once or twice, leaning in towards his painted pet and coaxing Lianfang to whisper in his ear. Lan Xichen has a cultivator’s hearing; he can catch most of what Lianfang says, whispered though it is. </p><p>“He is lying, xiandu; our own scouts reported that the bridge repairs were completed not three weeks past.”</p><p>“The Qu sect holds the lands east of the Nangong sect; does xiandu think an alliance might be in the offering?”</p><p>“It matches the reports we had this time last year, xiandu. I believe your steward set aside grain for just this eventuality.”</p><p>He is an able steward. Lan Xichen cannot imagine wasting a man with such a mind by making him a courtesan, but then, he cannot imagine ordering the Cloud Recesses burnt to the ground.</p><p align="center">»»— ☼ —««</p><p>Lianfang attends Lan Xichen wearing red silk robes so thin they might be spidersilk, embroidered with white peacocks, concealing almost nothing of the body beneath. Lan Xichen fixes his gaze on a point above Lianfang’s head and reminds himself that there is almost no chance the boy has chosen his own wardrobe. It is not Lianfang’s fault that Wen Ruohan wishes to make a point.</p><p>“Would Zewu-jun care for some tea?” Lianfang asks, in a voice as soft as summer rain.</p><p>“I’m afraid Qishan’s preferences don’t suit my palate,” Lan Xichen says. He tries, for appearances’ sake, to smile. Lianfang smiles back, a tiny expression, almost shy, with just the faintest hint of dimples appearing on his chalk-white cheeks.</p><p>“Never fear, Zewu-jun; I am here to rescue you from red tea.” Lianfang produces a tiny wooden box from his sleeves and offers it up for Lan Xichen’s inspection. Lan Xichen reaches out and takes the box. It is unavoidable that their hands should brush against each other; the box is small, and Lan Xichen’s hands are large. He has no excuse for lingering, no excuse for allowing Lianfang’s thumbs to brush across his palms.</p><p>When he opens the box, he finds a small, perfect cake of white molihua cha, with a single preserved jasmine blossom resting on top. The scent is so sweetly refreshing it takes away his breath. He has to set the box down and exhale, slow, controlled, before he can look at Lianfang.</p><p>“If you are willing to help this humble cultivator determine where they have put the tea set,” Lan Xichen says, “I would be honoured to have you join me.”</p><p align="center">»»— ☼ —««</p><p>Wen Ruohan invites Lan Xichen to take a turn in the gardens. Lan Xichen knows by now that he can refuse, if he wishes, but all refusal gives him is more time alone in an opulent prison; he accepts.</p><p>The gardens of Qishan are not at all like those of Gusu, or indeed of any garden Lan Xichen has ever seen. A garden, to his mind, is a place where lush green plants sprout from rich dark soil, carefully tended to produce the healthiest specimens, the greatest aesthetic advantage.</p><p>Wen Ruohan’s garden has no soil; the ground is paved in gravel, and the plants grow straight from boulders and rocks strewn about the courtyard. Many of them are faintly blue, or grey, or purple; almost none are truly green. It could, perhaps, be beautiful in its own way; under the circumstances, it leaves Lan Xichen with a voracious desire for the gardens of Gusu, the pine trees, the gentians. He would even accept the endless honey-sweet flowers of Lanling, if it meant he was away from here.</p><p>As always, Wen Ruohan is joined by his shimmering red shadow. Lianfang is, today, wearing strings of golden bells around his wrists and ankles; he chimes gently as he walks, a sweetly musical counterpoint to the crunch of boots against gravel. The effect is rather spoiled by the sound of Wen soldiers drilling, the shouts of the drill instructor and crash of swords echoing clearly through the garden.</p><p>“Zewu-jun,” Wen Ruohan says. He is smiling; Wen Ruohan is almost always smiling when he speaks to Lan Xichen. “I wonder if the rumours of Gusu Lan are true.”</p><p>“There are many rumours of Gusu Lan,” Lan Xichen replies. He is quite sure he knows where Wen Ruohan intends to direct their conversation. He is quite sure he cannot prevent it.</p><p>“I have heard,” Wen Ruohan says, “that no disciple of Gusu Lan may indulge in the pleasures of the flesh.”</p><p>They stop walking. Wen Ruohan studies Lan Xichen’s face intently, still smiling. He reaches out without looking away, catches Lianfang by the wrist, and reels him in. Lianfang comes in a jingling whirl, giggling as Wen Ruohan takes him in his arms.</p><p>Lan Xichen does not speak.</p><p align="center">»»— ☼ —««</p><p>“You must know,” Lan Xichen says, as delicately as he can, “I am not interested in...”</p><p>Lianfang looks up from the weiqi board. He arches an eyebrow at Lan Xichen and turns his head, using his chin to point at the open door. </p><p>“... many entertainments,” Lan Xichen finishes somewhat lamely. He had not considered that his disinterest in engaging Lianfang for some kind of carnal pleasure might be something he should hold close to his chest.</p><p>“I believe that is why Wen-xiandu sent me to you, Zewu-jun,” Lianfang says. He looks at the weiqi board again, considering, and sets down a white stone. “It is known that the Gusu Lan favour a sheltered lifestyle. Wen-xiandu hopes I will be able to... assist you, in making certain explorations.” He looks up at Lan Xichen from under his eyelashes. His kohl turns his eyes into dark, bottomless pools, moonless nights trapped in each iris.</p><p>“Ah,” Lan Xichen says. So, his silence is not to protect <em>him</em>, after all. “You are welcome to make the attempt, if Wen-xiandu finds it necessary.”</p><p>“I wouldn’t wish to impose, Zewu-jun.” Lianfang looks pointedly at the weiqi board.</p><p>Lan Xichen realises he hasn’t moved yet. He chuckles and sets down a white stone, polished yunzi almost as pale as Lianfang’s gossamer robes.</p><p>“I was never good at this game,” he says.</p><p>“Oh, me neither,” Lianfang says, selecting his own black stone between two elegant fingers. “I learned because Wen-xiandu wished to play more often.” He glances to one side, then the other, the ornaments in his hair swinging gently with the moment, and beckons Lan Xichen to come closer. “May I entrust you with a secret, Zewu-jun?”</p><p>Lan Xichen leans forward, not so far as to be indecorous. He imagines leaning further; imagines his face is barely an inch away from Lianfang’s face, imagines he can feel the faint warmth of Lianfang’s breath across his cheek. “Of course.”</p><p>“Given the choice,” Lianfang says, low and a little throaty, looking up at Lan Xichen from beneath his lashes, “I would rather play mah-jong.”</p><p>Lan Xichen stares at him, uncomprehending. Lianfang wiggles his eyebrows and winks.</p><p>That, of all things, breaks Lan Xichen’s composure entirely. He has to cover his face with both hands as he laughs and laughs and laughs, laughs until his belly hurts, laughs until his eyes are watering. Lianfang laughs too, a more refined chuckle, sweet as the chimes he sometimes wears in his hair.</p><p align="center">

</p><p>“Ah, see? Zewu-jun is very beautiful when he is happy,” Lianfang says, and offers Lan Xichen a handkerchief. “I am honoured to have seen such a thing.”</p><p>“Just now, Lianfang,” Lan Xichen says, accepting the handkerchief and dabbing delicately at his streaming eyes, “I think you are the only one who could.”</p><p>He isn’t sure what he means – whether Lianfang is the only one who could see his smile, or the only one who could <em>make </em>him smile, or the only one who could see him at all – but Lianfang seems to draw some kind of meaning from his words. His painted face forms a solemn mask, and he nods at Lan Xichen, just once. He looks at the weiqi board again, studies it, drumming his fingers against the table. He sets down a gleaming black stone.</p><p>“Your move, Zewu-jun.”</p><p align="center">»»— ☼ —««</p><p>Lan Xichen attempts true seclusion only once. He manages to ignore every knock on his door until the morning of the third day, when the knock is accompanied by a voice.</p><p>“This lowly one apologises, Zewu-jun.” Lianfang’s gentle tenor, courtly, polite, so soft Lan Xichen can barely hear him through the door. “I do not wish to disturb you, but Wen-xiandu will be displeased if I cannot tell him I saw you. Please forgive this unworthy one for the intrusion.”</p><p>Xichen looks at the door, and waits, and wonders.</p><p>There is a long silence, and then the voice speaks again. “As Zewu-jun wishes.”</p><p>There is a faint tremor beneath the smooth manners. Before he can even recognise the impulse, Lan Xichen is across the room, opening the door.</p><p>Wen Ruohan’s concubine promptly folds into a perfect bow. He is a thing of beauty; today his diaphanous silks are mostly white, with swirls of red and gold embroidery that mimic the shapes of peacock feathers. Xichen drags his eyes away from the elegant line of the concubine’s back and raises him out of his bow.</p><p>“There,” he says. “You have seen this humble cultivator. Will your master be satisfied?”</p><p>Lianfang draws his arms slowly out of Lan Xichen’s grip, until his fingertips are resting on Lan Xichen’s palms. “If he is not, it will only be my concern, Zewu-jun.”</p><p>The urge to close his fingers around Lianfang’s is almost a physical force. It has been a long time since Lan Xichen was touched for any reason other than control or cruelty. </p><p>Instead, he focuses on Lianfang’s face. Here and there, Lan Xichen can catch a glimpse of the person under the paint; the high cheekbones, the delicate nose. Lianfang has drawn his features on so that he is always wearing a perfect mask of placidity, but Lan Xichen thinks he can see the faint suggestion of strain around his eyes, in the corners of his mouth. </p><p>“Perhaps,” he says, “you would consider joining this unworthy one for a game of weiqi. I regret that my hospitality is somewhat lacking...”</p><p>“A matter which is easily corrected, Zewu-jun,” says Lianfang. He gives Lan Xichen a tiny smile, just enough to reveal the dimples in his cheeks. Lan Xichen’s breath stops.</p><p align="center">»»— ☼ —««</p><p>Lan Xichen’s possessions were taken from him when he arrived in Nightless City; his clothes, his boots, the combs in his hair. Shuoyue and Liebing, of course, had already been in Wen Xu’s possession. </p><p>In place of his Lan sect robes, Xichen is provided with clothes in dark grey, edged in white; they give an effect of being clad in smoke, billowing from an unseen fire. It is, perhaps, a sign of courtesy that they do not dress him in the colours of the Wen sect; he accepts them. In place of his jade and silver guan, he is provided with an ornament in the image of a flame, carved from obsidian. This, he leaves behind whenever he anticipates Wen Ruohan will see him. </p><p>These are the clothes he is wearing the day Wen Ruohan reveals that he has found each and every one of the sacred texts Lan Xichen had carried away from the Cloud Recesses. These are the clothes he is wearing the day he stands in the great hall of Nightless City and watches his sect’s greatest treasures burn. </p><p align="center">»»— ☼ —««</p><p>The Nightless City is never cold, but it seems to freeze when the Sunshot Campaign commences. </p><p>News comes in fits and starts, trickling into Lianfang’s hands, and from there into Lan Xichen’s ears. The heir to Yunmeng Jiang, thought dead, has returned and reclaimed Lotus Pier from the Wen forces there. Qinghe Nie have established the Unclean Realm as the staging ground for the sects, and plan to launch an offensive into Qishan itself. Wen Chao and Wen Zhuliu are both missing after a guerrilla force of cultivators tore apart the supervisory office they were staying in. </p><p>Wen Ruohan’s courtesies disappear, one by one. There are no more dinners, no more walks in the garden; there is only the increasing sense of heat and pressure emanating from him as the news grows worse. </p><p align="center">»»— ☼ —««</p><p>He cannot keep himself from weeping. </p><p>It is, perhaps, a saving grace that his tears in the great hall were silent. Dignified, even. He had maintained a certain stoicism until he had been returned to his cell, until the door was closed and locked behind him, and then he had knelt down and sobbed, awful animal noises wrenching their way free from his belly until he buckled forward, cheek pressing against the floor. </p><p>The following hours blur together. He had retreated to the bed at some point; he had torn off the smoke-coloured robes. He had flung a pitcher of water across the room, shattering the porcelain and spraying several paper wall hangings with water. They had been ruined beyond repair. It had not helped. </p><p>Perhaps he sleeps fitfully, or perhaps he simply lays still, eyes closed, breathing through the pain.</p><p>Eventually, he becomes aware that Lianfang is in his room. </p><p>Lianfang leaves him alone for a time. He moves quietly around the room, collecting shards of porcelain, straightening furniture, tidying away minor elements of clutter. </p><p>“Leave it,” Lan Xichen says. His voice sounds hoarse, as though he has been screaming; he would know if he had screamed, surely. “It’s my mess. I can clean it up.” </p><p>“This humble one is here to serve you, Zewu-jun,” Lianfang says. He looks at Lan Xichen only briefly, a flicker of gleaming eyes under dark lashes, there and gone. </p><p>“Do you know,” Lan Xichen says, through a throat that feels cracked beyond repair, “that among the Lan sect, we bury our books?” </p><p>Lianfang pauses, the box of molihua cha he had given Lan Xichen in his hands. He sets it down carefully and crosses the room on silent feet, sweeping his robes aside so he can sit on the bed beside Lan Xichen. “I didn’t know that.” </p><p>“Not… routinely,” Lan Xichen says. It feels somehow important that Lianfang understands this, that he explain himself. “Not all books. The works of Lan An, and the other elders of our sect. The writings of the Lan Immortals. When they are damaged beyond repair, when they are no longer readable, they are wrapped in a shroud and buried in a place of honour, near to the elders of the sect.”</p><p>Lianfang says nothing. Lan Xichen exhales and turns onto his side, curling in on himself. His body is a single muscle contracting, pushing words out of his mouth. </p><p>“Tell me, Lianfang,” he says, “why is it that I didn’t weep for even the youngest child slaughtered in the attack on Cloud Recesses? Why is it that I didn’t weep for even my little brother? Why is it that only here, only now, do I weep for nothing more than ink and paper?” </p><p>He is weeping again in truth, tears winding slow paths down his cheeks. Perhaps he never stopped. </p><p>Lianfang looks down at Lan Xichen. In the dark room, behind the dark kohl, his eyes seem to shine. He reaches out and Lan Xichen reaches blindly back, tangles their fingers together. </p><p>“Zewu-jun,” Lianfang says, “what you weep over can be so much more than the thing itself.” </p><p align="center">»»— ☼ —««</p><p>Lan Xichen does not recognise the man standing at his door when he opens it. He is small and slight with delicate features, wearing a robe far too large for him that only serves to make him look smaller. </p><p>“Zewu-jun,” he says, in a voice like petals falling, and just like that, Lan Xichen knows him. </p><p>“Lianfang,” he replies, and steps aside to let him in. </p><p>Lianfang waits for Xichen to close the door before he speaks. </p><p>“Wen Ruohan’s sons are dead,” he says. “You must be gone from Nightless City tonight, or he will take your head in trade.” </p><p>The news settles into Lan Xichen’s chest like ice. He tips his head forward, closes his eyes, presses his fingertips into his eyelids. </p><p>“All right,” he says. “Tonight, then.” </p><p>“You won’t be alone,” Lianfang says. He wraps one of his hands around Lan Xichen’s wrist and draws it away from his eyes. Lan Xichen looks at him, studying his naked face. There’s a little streak of white paint he must have missed, caught in the fine hairs near his ear. Lan Xichen could reach out and use his thumb to wipe it away.</p><p>Lianfang turns Lan Xichen’s hand over to expose his palm. His other hand comes to rest atop it, curled into a fist. He looks up at Xichen, catches his eyes, and uncurls his fingers. </p><p>When he withdraws his hand, he leaves a solid weight behind. Lan Xichen looks down.</p><p>In his palm, hewn out of the grey stone of Qinghe, is the personal seal of Nie Mingjue.</p><p>“My name,” Lianfang says, “is Meng Yao. Will you come with me?”</p>
