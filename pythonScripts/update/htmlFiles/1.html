      <p>Summary</p>
      <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>If there's one thing that is known in magical Britain, it's that squibs can't do magic. At all. Everyone knows that. </p>
<p>The question is: how do they know that? Where did this certainty come from? The way the magical world works seems to be an inconvertible fact as immutable as gravity but the underpinnings of that world are built on sand and made of rotten wood. </p>
<p>When one Harry Potter is delivered to the hands of his oh-so-Squib Aunt, Petunia Dursley, it would seem that he would grow up ignorant, abused and desperate for anything that could save him from the mundane world. But squibs aren't what they seem, and neither is the magical world. What Harry discovers on his first trip to Diagon Alley changes far more than anyone might have expected.</p></blockquote>

      <p>Notes</p>
        <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>Written for the 2020 Quantum Bang</p>
<p>Credit for dragging me into writing Harry Potter fic after years of not writing any fanfic at all goes squarely to Keira Marcos, though as always for me, I went in my own direction for pretty much everything from cannon to how magic works to the goblins and the Dursleys. Thanks for the inspiration, Keira!</p></blockquote>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Mrs. and Mr. Dursley of number four Privet Drive were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. Mrs. Dursley, formerly Miss Petunia Evans, had dedicated much of her life, from the age of thirteen, to being as normal as possible at all times.</p>
<p>This was a challenge.</p>
<p>Mr. Dursley, Vernon, was a director of Grunnings. It was a new position. A precarious position. One which required careful work and maintenance to ensure that he was not demoted or sidelined by the other four directors who were all working as hard as they possibly could to move up to Vice President and then, eventually, someday after the current President retired, to the top position.</p>
<p>When she'd married Vernon, Petunia had had no idea that drill manufacturing was such a competitive field. As if Vernon's precarious position wasn't difficult enough, Grunnings was but one drill manufacturer in the country and the most powerful one, too. At least, for now. Everything Vernon did reflected on both his position as director and on Grunnings.</p>
<p>Everything Petunia did, from her dresses to her yard to her darling little boy Dudley impacted Vernon's prospects too. If her hair was mussed, people talked. If her flower beds had weeds, people frowned. If Dudley, who was perfect in every way that counted, had colic, well.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>It was a challenge, truly.</p>
<p>The Dursleys had everything they wanted, barely, but Petunia had a secret that she knew could destroy everything she'd built, everything they'd built together and every hope that her little Diddykums could ever harbor.</p>
<p>Petunia had a sister. Lily. Sweet, perfect, pretty Lily who had always danced through life with a bright smile, a twinkle in her eye and the sort of luck that simply didn't happen to normal folks. When they were children, Petunia and Lily had been inseparable.  The sun shined for Petunia every time little Lily smiled and it had from the moment she was born.</p>
<p>But then Lily had gotten her invitation to That School. She'd gone off, leaving Petunia behind in Cokeworth, and come back different. There was a sort of air around her. Much like that nasty Snape boy that had always stalked Lily, not that Lily ever believed Petunia when she said that she'd seen him lurking about their back yard at night.</p>
<p>Lily's hair shimmered even in the dark. Her eyes were quicksilver, shifting color in ways that eyes just didn't. Her voice had a thrum, very faint underneath the actual words she said, that made one listen. Made. Not like someone who'd properly studied oratory but like you were compelled to hear Lily's words to the exclusion of anyone else around you.</p>
<p>Oh, Petunia had tried to talk to Lily about it. Tried to explain the ways that she was changing, becoming something strange and very, very noticeable in their very quiet, very conservative, very poor and very desperate little town. Being noticed was An Issue. Different people always faced harassment. Or worse.</p>
<p>Their families faced Or Worse just as often as the offenders, too.</p>
<p>As Lily changed, Petunia did not want Or Worse to happen to her.</p>
<p>It only got worse, though. That Snape boy started following Lily around all the time. Then she got involved with that James Potter and his thuggish, bullying friends. Those four were more obvious by far than Lily and Snape. Anyone seeing them noticed that they were Not Quite Right. It showed in their eyes, their voices, the way they moved and talked and dressed and…</p>
<p>Petunia had moved out as quickly as she could. She'd gotten a flat, dated the most normal men she could, and eventually caught Vernon's eye. He was a big, sturdy rugby man with hands of surprising delicacy given how blunt his fingers were. His chin was grey with five o'clock shadow by ten in the morning and he adored taking tea with Petunia. His parents were older, a gentile yeomanry family that went back to the War of the Roses.</p>
<p>They'd not been pleased at all with Petunia. Oh, they never said so, but her clothes were too common, her accent far too lesser-Cokeworth. Too poor, too vulgar, too Not Them. She'd worked desperately hard to earn their regard, studying proper manners and discretion and clothes and gossip with Vernon's sister Marge and with her soon-to-be mother-in-law until the day her mother-in-law died.</p>
<p>Mum and Dad had been a bit bewildered by it all. Neither of them had ever felt the need to be anything other than what they were: solid peasant stock of a certain, lower, class. Lily had mocked Petunia for her aspirations endlessly.</p>
<p>Wizarding folk didn't have lord and ladies. Wizarding folk believed in equality. Wizarding folk judged you by your magic, not by your bloodlines or the contents of your purse.</p>
<p>Petunia wasn't at all sure that Lily told the truth on that. She never had been. The odd little looks James and his very best friend in the world Sirius Black had exchanged when Lily said such things suggested otherwise. Either way, Petunia had been very, very glad after they both were married to direct Lily not to contact her or Vernon, ever, unless it was a matter of life and death.</p>
<p>Something important was fine. If someone was ill, of course Petunia would be available to Lily. But casual contact? Visits and dinner parties and socializing? Goodness, no. Their lives and their husbands were far too different for that to work.</p>
<p>There'd only been occasional letters since then. It was fine. Petunia missed her sister, occasionally, but it was the young Lily she missed. Not the grown Lily who only had contempt for Petunia's choice to live a safe, normal life that wouldn't get her persecuted for being Odd.</p>
<p>So, when Petunia woke up on November first to a dull, grey Tuesday, it was strange that her little sister Lily was on her mind. She sent Vernon off to work and smiled brightly as she attempted to feed Dudley his breakfast despite his continuing battles with colic because Marge always said that babies picked up on your mood if you telegraphed it loudly enough. It hadn't worked yet but Petunia was quite ready to try anything at this point.</p>
<p>Weeding the garden, Petunia noticed owls flying overhead. She froze every time one flitted by but none of them brought a letter from Lily. Every owl that passed her by added a leaden weight to her heart.</p>
<p>Dudley cried all day. All day. Sometimes the screaming cries of a colicky baby. Sometimes the cries of a child who was sad though there was no reason for him to be sad. He cried and cried and cried. He threw his toys and food. He hit Petunia whenever she picked him up and then clung to her to cry some more.</p>
<p>By the time Vernon got home, twitching in ways that made the lead weight over Petunia's heart increase a thousand times, Petunia was exhausted. Thankfully, so was Dudley. He finally ate, allowed himself to be bathed and then fell asleep the instant he was put in his crib.</p>
<p>Petunia stared down at Dudley, wondering how her nephew was. She'd never met little Harry. Lily had sent a nice little card after Harry's birth with glitter that was magic rather than proper glitter. There'd been a picture of the three of them, Lily holding her baby and smiling as she swayed and gleamed and laughed. Her husband James had stood behind her, dusky skin rosy with stunned joy as baby Harry gripped his finger in a tiny hand. They'd moved and smiled at the camera, James waving Harry's hand at Petunia.</p>
<p>She'd burned both the card and the picture so that no one would see them. Really, it was as though Lily had decided that the Statute of Secrecy didn't apply to her. Or to Petunia. Terribly rude of her given the damage that Obliviation could do to a mundane brain.</p>
<p>Despite her exhaustion, sleep didn't come easily, especially after Vernon asked about Harry. Something was wrong. Petunia could feel it. She didn't know what was wrong, but something was very, very wrong with Lily and James and Harry.</p>
<p>And, given past history, that wrongness would endanger everything Petunia had built. That was just the way Petunia's luck went. She sighed as she rolled over and stared out the window where strange fireworks were still going off in the distance. She shut her eyes, refusing to remember the time that James and Sirius had set fireworks just like that after Snape when he'd been caught stalking Lily in her parents' back yard after dark.</p>
<p>It was none of her business. Tomorrow would be another day and if she was very, very lucky, the colic Dudley's doctor claimed couldn't possibly still be colic would finally break and he'd go back to being the happy little boy she'd brought home from the hospital. She would put the milk bottles out, kiss Vernon goodbye before he went to work and weed her flower beds in the front. She'd gossip, properly in just the right curious but not excited tone, about that new couple that'd moved into Number 13 up the street, with her neighbors.</p>
<p>It would be normal. Quiet and demure and perfect, just what she had worked so very hard on all these years. Nothing would upset her life. Nothing at all.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>"Vernon!"</p>
<p>Harry started as Aunt Petunia slapped a palm down on the kitchen table. She'd rarely ever glared that way at anyone but Harry. He got it all the time. His hair was too messy, his voice too loud. He stared too much and the wrong way. Every little thing he did made Aunt Petunia purse her lips and send him either to his cupboard under the stairs or out into the garden to pull weeds until he 'got himself under control'.</p>
<p>Not this time.</p>
<p>"But Pet…" Uncle Vernon started to say as he shook Harry's strange yellow letter at her.</p>
<p>"Remember your position," Aunt Petunia hissed at him.</p>
<p>Dudley eased carefully away from Uncle Vernon. He punched Harry in the shoulder as he passed, then flinched when Aunt Petunia's eyes flicked his way. Uncle Vernon went the grayish white of old porridge as Aunt Petunia snatched Harry's letter out of his hands.</p>
<p>"We swore we wouldn't have it," Uncle Vernon said, color starting to come back to his cheeks. It faded when Aunt Petunia turned and glared at him. "We did!"</p>
<p>"You did, Vernon," Aunt Petunia said so scathingly that all three of them winced and curled inwards around themselves. "I didn't. It won't work. They'll only keep coming. Those people won't take no for an answer. They won't take silence for an answer. We've done the best we can but it's no good. The boy has to go."</p>
<p>She shook her head and passed the letter back to Uncle Vernon with the Disapproving Sniff of Doom that usually meant that someone was getting the cut direct or Harry was getting a spanking, no dinner and sent to his cupboard to Think About What He'd Done. Which, honestly, was always easier when he was in a nice quiet, dark space where no one could get at him. Nowhere in the house was as good as his cupboard for that.</p>
<p>Dudley frowned. "I want to read that letter!"</p>
<p>"I want to read it," Harry said as he stepped closer and glared up at Uncle Vernon, "as it's mine!"</p>
<p>"Get out, both of you," Uncle Vernon croaked as he stuffed the letter back into its strange yellow envelope.</p>
<p>Harry didn't move. Aunt Petunia did. She snatched the letter out of Uncle Vernon's hands and thrust it into Harry's despite the horrified roar from Uncle Vernon. Then she put one narrow hand in the center of Uncle Vernon's massive chest and shoved him back until he hit the wall. </p>
<p>It should have been comical. Uncle Vernon was huge, a behemoth, and Aunt Petunia was so skinny and whip-like by comparison. It wasn't. At all. When she leaned close, her narrow nose almost touching Uncle Vernon's fat one, Uncle Vernon gulped.</p>
<p>"Remember your position," Aunt Petunia hissed, a strange little hum to her voice that Harry only heard when Aunt Petunia was truly furious. "You're still on new job probation. You'll lose the Vice Presidency. You'll be demoted. Anthony Black will get Accounting. He'll be President of Grunnings, Vernon."</p>
<p>It was the ultimate threat, the one that never failed to get either Uncle Vernon or Dudley to behave. Dudley actually gasped behind Harry. Harry, for his part, clutched his letter to his chest. This letter could do that? Harry could do that? But how?</p>
<p>"R-Right you are, Pet," Uncle Vernon said, gulping when the words wouldn't come out right at first. "Dudley and I will just… go watch TV."</p>
<p>"But I want to read--!"</p>
<p>Dudley snapped his mouth shut and ran for the living room when Aunt Petunia turned her glare on him. Uncle Vernon stayed perfectly still until Aunt Petunia let him go. Then he hurried after Dudley, shutting the kitchen door firmly behind him. Harry hardly dared breathe until Aunt Petunia sighed and waved for Harry to sit at the table.</p>
<p>"Read it," Aunt Petunia ordered. "Everything changes once you do, Harry. There's no stopping that. No stopping any of it. But you will remember that every single thing you do, everything you say, the way you look and act and move affects the three of us. Do you understand?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Aunt Petunia," Harry said even though he hadn't a clue what she meant.</p>
<p>He read the letter. Then he read it again. Then he read it a third time, checking the back for any sign that it was a joke or a fake or anything but exactly what it said: an invitation to a school of witchcraft and wizardry.</p>
<p>"Ah, I don't understand, Aunt Petunia," Harry finally admitted. "Is this real?"</p>
<p>"Oh, it's very real," Aunt Petunia said so bitterly that Harry curled inwards again. "My perfect sister Lily went off to that school. She'd always been strange, always had that air to her that told you she wasn't quite right. Wasn't normal. Her hair and her eyes and the way she talked. People noticed it. They always noticed it. That Snape boy was just the same, just as odd and strange as Lily was but worse with his stalking and his obsession with my sister. Your father was worse still. He'd been born and raised to it. To magic. He couldn't pass as normal no matter how he tried."</p>
<p>"…That's important?" Harry asked, blinking at her. </p>
<p>He carefully pushed his glasses up. They'd broken a few days ago so he'd taped them back together again because there was no money for new glasses for Harry, not with Uncle Vernon's new position and all the things they'd had to buy for him to fit in as Vice President. Between that and Dudley's birthday presents, there just wasn't any cash for new glasses. Despite the tape, his glasses were wobbly still.</p>
<p>Aunt Petunia nearly scorched Harry's skin with her acid glare. "It's the law. The Statue of Secrecy demands that no one nonmagical learn about anything magical. Oh, they'll ensure that no one remembers a thing, but there's a price when a magical breaks the Statute. There's a spell." </p>
<p>The way she said 'spell' was so scornful that Harry ducked his head and leaned away from her. </p>
<p>"It changes a person to be obliviated. They can't remember things properly for quite a while. Personality changes, night terrors. It's an ugly business and every single time you do something that shows magic is real to a non-magical, that's what happens to them."</p>
<p>"But not to me," Harry whispered. "They wouldn't do it to me."</p>
<p>Aunt Petunia sniffed. "Of course not. Not us, Vernon and I, because we already know. But Dudley? They could decide my Diddykums didn't need to know. They could obliviate him and damage his brain worse than a football concussion. It's already happened at school, you know. That Maths teacher? She figured out what you are and they came to obliviate her. She had to be taken away because they took too much of her memory. She couldn't remember how to do maths, how to teach, anymore."</p>
<p>"Oh, no." Harry held the letter away from his chest. </p>
<p>It seemed much more dangerous now. People had been harmed because of him? They'd had memories taken away? No wonder no one at school wanted to be his friend. He jerked as something Aunt Petunia had said explained the strange moments in his life.</p>
<p>"It shows?" Harry said. "Even when you don't want it to? I'm showing it?"</p>
<p>Aunt Petunia nodded. She sipped her tea and glared at him over the top of the mug. Her eyes flicked from his mop of hair that never behaved to his eyes, so green that Aunt Petunia always claimed they looked unnatural, to his tan skin that never burned no matter how much time he spent weeding in the garden.</p>
<p>Not that there were many weeds in the garden anymore. They'd stopped coming back several years ago when he'd cried after Aunt Petunia scolded him for scaring a neighbor talking to one of the garter snakes in the neighborhood. That made him think of his cupboard, the one place where he was perfectly safe from both Dudley and Vernon. They did lock him in sometimes, but he realized the hasp never stayed locked if Harry wanted out. Not to mention that time he ended up on the roof while trying to escape Dudley and his friends during Harry Hunting after school.</p>
<p>"Oh, wow," Harry whispered.</p>
<p>"We'll need to send a reply," Aunt Petunia said. "And you'll need to get supplies. I don't know how we'll afford it. That Man always said that our costs would be covered but he's never done a thing for you. For us. Refused to even send someone from That World to check on how you were developing. I swear, it'sso aggravating. We've done the best we could but you're not normal and we had no way to handle all the things that happened when you got upset, especially as a baby. That cupboard was the only place, the only thing, that would make you stop crying."</p>
<p>"Wow." Harry stared at Aunt Petunia. "I didn't… know that."</p>
<p>Not that she was wrong. He'd always know that he was safe in his cupboard. It was a trap and he hated being shoved in there by Uncle Vernon, but it was different when Aunt Petunia sent him to his cupboard. She always made it seem more like he was to curl up and breathe, think, relax until he could stop being so upset. For Uncle Vernon it was getting out of his sight until Uncle Vernon calmed down again which frequently took forever.</p>
<p>She shook her head before going to the drawers and retrieving a pen, a pad of paper and an envelope which she passed to Harry. He wrote out a reply stating his acceptance and request for someone to escort him to get his supplies at her prompting, spelling carefully and using his very best penmanship. Then she sealed the letter and had him write 'Minerva McGonagall' on the cover with 'Deputy Headmistress' underneath and 'Hogwarts' under that.</p>
<p>"Come on," Aunt Petunia said. "Out in the back yard."</p>
<p>"Uh, aren't we going to mail this?" Harry asked but he followed because he wasn't going to be the one that got Aunt Petunia mad enough to go for her wooden spoon. That always stung when she smacked Harry.</p>
<p>"Of course we are," Aunt Petunia said. "Hurry along now."</p>
<p>Outside, the day was bright, sunny and clear with blue skies dotted by tiny white clouds skipping across the sky. The garden seemed to perk up as soon as Harry stepped out the back door. Aunt Petunia's lips pursed for it.</p>
<p>"That wasn't my imagination," Harry said slowly as he stared at the flowers and vegetables preening for him.</p>
<p>"No, it wasn't," Aunt Petunia agreed. "Now, hold your arm up and declare, loudly, that you have a letter for Minerva McGonagall."</p>
<p>Harry stared at Aunt Petunia but did as she instructed. He stood there for a solid minute, the garden shifting and almost murmuring around him. Then a barn owl swooped down and landed delicately on his arm. The great curving claws didn't dig into his arm at all, even though they could have ripped right through his shirt and his flesh. He nearly fell down in shock.</p>
<p>"Please deliver it promptly," Aunt Petunia said to the owl. "Payment will be on delivery."</p>
<p>The owl hooted, offering one leg to Harry. He stared bewildered until Aunt Petunia took the letter and carefully tied the letter to leather jesses on the owl's leg. Her expression was much like the time Harry had brought a snake in as a little boy, prim and disgusted by the messiness of everything Harry Potter. The owl hooted again and then took off in a waft of great, soft wings. Aunt Petunia sighed, pushing Harry back into the house.</p>
<p>"Well, that's that," Aunt Petunia said. "Hopefully one of Them will reply with how exactly we're to get your supplies for you when we've not got the money for it. They use different currency entirely from us. Lily had a bank account at the wizarding bank, but I can't take you there. Vernon can't even see wizarding places. No one mundane can. Someone else will have to take you the first time, then you can take me if needed."</p>
<p>Harry frowned. "That doesn't make much sense."</p>
<p>"I know," Aunt Petunia agreed with the disapproving sniff of doom. "Can't be helped. That's how That Type does these things. Come on now. Have your breakfast. We'll have to try to move you into Dudley's second bedroom again. The last time you blew out the windows but hopefully it'll go better now that you know."</p>
<p>Harry shook his head as he sat at the table and started to eat. How much of his life had been a mistake? Or, more accurately, how much had he misunderstood? Far more than he'd thought, apparently. Whatever this was, he'd have to pay close attention, the same sort of attention he paid when Dudley invited his friends over and they had that Harry Hunting look about their smiles.</p>
<p>He really didn't want anyone else to be hurt because of him.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Hagrid hesitated, licking his lips as he studied Privet Drive. Dumbledore'd been really clear that Hagrid had to go pick Harry up so's he could get his school supplies, but this wasn't what he'd expected. The whole place was so… rigid. Every single house looked the same. Same size, same shape, same over-clipped lawns with same flower beds. Most of 'em even had the same flowers in their flowerbeds.</p>
<p>He'd never seen the like. Where was the life? The originality? The magic?</p>
<p>Except, no, this was a Muggle neighborhood. Maybe they weren't allowed to have houses that reflected their personalities? Hagrid shook his head, pulled his pants up a touch, and then strode up the street from the spot behind the big holly tree at the corner that Dumbldore's portkey had deposited him. </p>
<p>Not the greatest place to arrive. His umbrella'd gotten caught for a second on the holly, but it couldn't be helped. Every step he took into the place made Hagrid's skin crawl. He could feel people watching him, but when he looked at the houses he passed, the curtains twitched like someone was hiding behind them.</p>
<p>They weren't afraid of him, were they?</p>
<p>Well, they were Muggles. Might not be able to tell that Hagrid wasn't exactly what he should be, what with the broken wand and all. He counted the doors, looking for the numbers that Dumbledore'd said would be there.</p>
<p>Even Hagrid could count to four. Probably. Didn't exactly write their numbers the way Hagrid expected so it took him a bit to realize what he was looking for. Weren't in subtle glowing lights or sets of four on the porch. They'd all nailed actual numbers to their houses, metal ones. Looked like tin or brass which was downright odd. You’d think the things would wear out in the sun and rain, lose their shine.</p>
<p>Well, didn't matter none. They were Muggles and they could do what they wished with their houses. Hagrid had Important Business. Plus, he got to see little Harry Potter again and that was just the best thing about the day. Almost wished it was actually Harry's birthday. Then Hagrid could've made 'im a cake and bought him a birthday present. Wouldn't even care if Harry didn't eat the cake. It was the giving that mattered.</p>
<p>Number 4 Privet Drive didn't stick out in any obvious way from Number 6 and Number 2. It was a neat little two-story house with neat little flowerbeds and bland white curtains that twitched when Hagrid stopped and stared at the front door. Didn't look any different but oh, it felt different.</p>
<p>The flowerbeds were alive in ways that none of the others were. The house had a little shimmer that Hagrid could only see if he squinted just so. Wards, good strong ones. They felt like Dumbledore so they had to be for protecting Harry. Hagrid sucked in a breath, squared his shoulders and walked up the path to knock gently on the door.</p>
<p>It bounced against the frame and Hagrid winced. Sometimes he didn't know his strength with magical things, yeah, but he'd not expected Muggle houses to be that… fragile. Flimsy, even.</p>
<p>"Ah, yes?"</p>
<p>The young boy who opened the door had Lily Potter's eyes. Bright green, inquisitive, glowing ever so slightly with his magic. Hagrid beamed at him. For all his eyes were Lily's, his skin and hair and those glasses were all James Potter.</p>
<p>"As I live and breathe," Hagrid said, nodding to Harry, "it's so good to see you, Harry. I've not seen you since you were just a wee tyke. Professor Dumbledore sent me t'take you to get your school supplies. Got a portkey to get us to London and everything."</p>
<p>"Um, okay?" Harry said, blinking up at Hagrid as if he wasn't entirely sure he wanted to do anything like that.</p>
<p>"Sorry, sorry," Hagrid said as he realized that he'd completely forgotten to introduce himself like Professor Dumbledore said he should. "I'm Hagrid, Keeper of the Keys and Groundskeeper for Hogwarts. Headmaster Dumbledore said you'd requested someone to come take you to Diagon Alley for your supplies."</p>
<p>Harry sucked in a breath and slowly nodded. "Um, yes. We did. Um. You can come in while I get my shoes on? I think you'll fit."</p>
<p>Hagrid nodded, grinning at Harry. "I'm pretty good at squeezing down to fit into smaller places. Gotta be when you're my size. I'll just stay by the door though. Don't want to break anything. I can be a bit clumsy sometimes. Don't know my own strength."</p>
<p>When Harry stepped back, Hagrid hunched down and went sideways through the door. It was a bit of a tight fit around the middle, but he made it in without losing any buttons or breaking the door off the frame, so Hagrid counted that as good enough.</p>
<p>Inside of the house was just as bad as the outside of it. Square and bland and downright ugly to look at. Those square chairs and rectangular sofa must be so uncomfortable to sit on. Pictures on the walls didn't move at all. Hagrid almost poked at them, but then another boy, bigger'n Harry and much larger around, came out of the back room with a candy bar in his hand.</p>
<p>"Ah, who's this then?" Hagrid asked.</p>
<p>"Um, that's my cousin, Dudley," Harry said as he tied his shoes even faster. Somehow without making a single knot. Genius just like his mother Lily, that Harry. "Okay, I think I'm ready. I've got my letter."</p>
<p>"He's huge," Dudley breathed, staring at Hagrid with such wide eyes that you'd think it was awe if not for the way he kept inching further and further away.</p>
<p>"Mhm," Harry agreed. He grabbed Hagrid's wrist with his tiny little hand, tugging. "Let's go."</p>
<p>Hagrid frowned. "Where's the rest of your family, Harry? Dumbledore said you was living with family."</p>
<p>"I am," Harry said. "Aunt Petunia is in the back garden getting vegetables for tonight. Uncle Vernon is at work. It's summer, of course. That's why Dudley and I are here instead of somewhere else. Right, Dudley?"</p>
<p>"Ah, yeah?" Dudley said as his shoulders ran into the wall.</p>
<p>He wasn't an ugly boy, really. Bit too much chocolate around the mouth and a bit too soft in the middle for a kid that age, but he wasn't dressed too much better than Harry. Bigger clothes, newer ones, but not poncy fancy ones like the Slytherins would wear. Just seemed odd that he was so much bigger than Harry who was a scrawny little thing.</p>
<p>"Pity he's not here," Hagrid said as he let Harry pull him towards the front door. "Like to meet the man who's raised you all these years. Shake his hand. I brought you here after it all happened. Professor Dumbledore told me to. Said it was the safest place in the world for you. Glad to see that you've made it all right."</p>
<p>Harry's smile was a bit hesitant, a bit shy, but well, he was a very small boy and Hagrid knew very well that he was a very large man. Couldn't blame the boy for being a bit nervous. Didn't really matter either way. Hagrid squeezed out the door and then led Harry up the street to the holly tree. The curtains twitched even harder as they passed, but Hagrid didn't catch anyone staring at them.</p>
<p>"Gotta say," Hagrid murmured to Harry once they were securely behind the holly tree and out of sight of all those hidden, watching eyes, "this is a very scary place, Harry. 'M glad we're leaving."</p>
<p>Harry stared at Hagrid, mouth open. "This is scary?"</p>
<p>Hagrid shuffled his feet and blushed as he rummaged through his pockets for the second portkey Professor Dumbledore'd given him. It was in the eighth pocket, way down on the bottom under a biscuit wrapped in wax paper that Hagrid gave to Harry.</p>
<p>"It's a good one, chocolate chips with oatmeal," Hagrid said. "And yeah, it's all those people watching. Never did do well when I was being watched that way. Makes me nervous."</p>
<p>This time Harry's smile was a lot brighter, a lot more sympathetic. "I can see that. So, now what?"</p>
<p>"Now we take this portkey," Hagrid said, having Harry put one hand on the old brass key ring. "Mind you hold on tight. It's a bit of a whirl and up into the air. Bend your knees when you land, and you should be fine. Deep breath. On three. One, two, three… Diagon Alley!"</p>
<p>The magic of the portkey whooshed them up into the air and away to Diagon Alley, Hagrid laughing, and Harry screaming with shock and then delight as they flew towards London together.</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>Harry stepped into Madam Malkin's shop alone. He'd really have rathered have Hagrid with him but as green as Hagrid was, it was probably better to go it alone. The shop wasn't that bad. There were several plump mauve chairs, a short stout table, and heavy mauve velvet drapes between which stood headless manikins wearing Shakespearean robes. At least that's what they looked like to Harry.</p>
<p>"Hogwarts, dear?" asked Madam Malkin who was as squat as her table, as mauve as her drapes and as professionally smiling as Aunt Petunia when Uncle Vernon had work people over for a dinner party.</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am," Harry said. He plucked at his clothes, hand-me-downs from Dudley that he'd yet to grow into despite Aunt Petunia's insistence that one day he'd catch up to Dudley's growth. "And um, perhaps some basic wardrobe changes, too?"</p>
<p>"Easily done," Madam Malkin said. Her smile went wider with clear happiness at the prospect of a bigger commission. "Come in the back now. We've got the lot. There's another young man being fitted up just now, in fact."</p>
<p>The other boy was very, very pale, very, very blond and had a narrow face that one day would probably be quite striking but now just looked rather like a weasel's. He was wearing very nice clothes, like the ones Aunt Petunia always sighed over in fashion magazines. He had a nice grey pair of slacks that fit like they'd been made specifically for him. His shirt was made of very fine cream cotton that was as pale as he was. A plain back robe was being pinned up by another witch wearing a dark burgundy dress that looked like something out of a Victorian play. The stark black of the robe didn't suit his pale features at all.</p>
<p>He took one look at Harry, sweeping him head to toe with a scornful look for the hand-me-downs, and curled his lip.</p>
<p>"Hogwarts, too?" the other boy asked as Harry stepped up on his footstool.</p>
<p>Harry quailed for a moment and then pulled on Aunt Petunia's lessons on how to be Proper. He straightened his back, lifted his chin and imagined that his eyes went icy with disapproval at how improper the other boy was being, showing that sort of behavior in public. Both the witches straightened up, Madame Malkin with a little gasp. The blond boy flinched.</p>
<p>"Yes, I am," Harry said. "I suppose I should be pleased to meet another student. I'm Harry Potter. And you are?"</p>
<p>The other boy's eyes went very, very wide. They shimmered as they went from watery blue to a striking ice-blue that absolutely didn't look natural at all. Oh. So that's what Aunt Petunia meant about the eyes always looking wrong.</p>
<p>"My apologies," the other boy said. He made a little half-bow, one hand over his chest. "Draco Malfoy. It's a true honor to meet you."</p>
<p>"So I've been told several times so far today," Harry said and didn't allow himself to apologize for the sarcastic way it came out. Aunt Petunia would've had his ear in an instant for it. He turned back to Madame Malkin and smiled politely up at her. "I'd prefer things in darker colors, if possible, for the wardrobe. I look better in darker things rather than lighter ones that favor my cousin."</p>
<p>"Yes, of course, dear," Madame Malkin said with a delighted smile for his manners. "We'll get right on that."</p>
<p>Well, at least it was good to confirm that being very polite was a good thing to do. He'd have to get some etiquette books when he got his school books. There had to be rules about this sort of thing. Harry must need to know that stuff, right? Aunt Petunia always said that your manners reflected on your family and Harry was super-important because of what happened with Voldemort, so his manners had to be extra-perfect.</p>
<p>Draco kept trying to draw Harry into conversation. He started with Quidditch which Harry decided that he needed to get a rule book for and then moved onto the Sacred Twenty-Eight which Harry definitely needed a book on. Maybe three or four books given how Madame Malkin nodded her agreement with Draco at times. Then he moved into bragging about his father who sounded a lot like Uncle Vernon's rival at work, Anthony Black, in that he was rich and powerful and knew everyone and no one dared to speak poorly to or of him.</p>
<p>Not the rich, so much, for Anthony Black, but the rest was certainly true.</p>
<p>Sounded like someone that Harry didn't want anything to do with, so he answered Draco with little sniffs that would've done Aunt Petunia proud, noncommittal hums and the occasional side-eye when Draco started using what Harry was sure were slurs.</p>
<p>Whatever 'mudblood' actually meant, Harry was completely certain it was as rude as some of the things Aunt Marge said about his father when she was in her cups. Draco flushed for the side-eyes and shut up at long last.</p>
<p>Harry got five pairs of nice brown and black slacks with deep pockets that were charmed to let them hold about a hundred times more than they should have. He chose eight new shirts, four with short sleeves and four with long sleeves. All of them were jewel-toned red, blue, green or purple. He got all new socks and all new pants and, because Madame Malkin made it seem expected, he added three nice wool jumpers.</p>
<p>Even though Draco curled his lip, Harry insisted on the Faire Isle ones with multi-color knitting that were made out of good Scottish wool. They were the best ones that Madame Malkin had on stock and, honestly, they looked warm enough to see him through even the worst winter imaginable.</p>
<p>"Now I just need to figure out how to get these all home," Harry said once Madame Malkin fitted it all with magic and added charms so that his clothes would grow with him for two whole years.</p>
<p>"Oh, haven't you gotten your trunk yet, dear?" Madame Malkin asked with enough startlement that Harry blushed.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid not, ma'am," Harry said. "That was going to be next, I think."</p>
<p>"Well, if you want the best sort of truck my father always goes to a particular shop in Knockturn Alley," Draco announced while puffing up proudly.</p>
<p>He flinched as both Madame Malkin and her assistant turned to glare at him. Harry didn't laugh. He wanted to but he didn't. Aunt Petunia would've pinched his ear half-off if he had so Harry controlled himself.</p>
<p>"Do you have a recommendation, ma'am?" Harry asked Madame Malkin.</p>
<p>"You take yourself right next door," Madame Malkin said, casting a stern look Draco's way when he dared to open his mouth to protest. "They'll fix you up a treat. Make sure you get the full set. You'll want a trunk with expansion charms, built-in feather-light charms and a bottomless bookbag with a library function in it."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's vital," Madam Malkin's assistant said, speaking for the first time since Harry walked in. "You'll never survive without a library function in your bag. Too easy to lose assignments and books otherwise."</p>
<p>"Thank you very much," Harry said.</p>
<p>He beamed at them both, paid a shocking amount of money for his clothes though perhaps that was more because he'd never bought anything for himself before and then exited her shop with his packages in his arms. Hagrid was there with two ice cream cones so that was just the topper of the whole experience. They ate standing there. Harry nodded to Draco when he emerged to scuttle up the street towards the bookstore, and then the two of them continued on with the shopping.</p>
<p>Which was… challenging.</p>
<p>Hagrid had very firm opinions about what sort of trunk and bookbag Harry should get. And what he should and should not buy at the bookstore. Hagrid didn't think Madame Malkin's recommendation on the truck and book bag were a good idea. After comparing the weight of the two trunks, one with the feather-light and one without, Harry stared up at Hagrid and focused really hard on thinking his eyes as green as neon signs.</p>
<p>Both Hagrid and the shopkeeper had flinched. Harry had gotten the trunk and bookbag he wanted. Better still, the bookbag he got would hold the trunk inside it, so Harry didn't have to lug it around at all.</p>
<p>At the bookstore, Harry had to do the eye trick eight different times over etiquette books, history books, a handful of strange fiction books that he was desperate to read because his name was on the cover with dragons and manticores and a pyramid in Scotland of all things. The four books on the Sacred Twenty-Eight pitched Hagrid into an outright fit that nearly got them both thrown out, but making his voice thrum and his eyes glow and, surprisingly, his hair start shifting on his head shut Hagrid up at last.</p>
<p>He even got a very, very expensive magically charmed genealogy chart for the Sacred Twenty-Eight that showed exactly how they related to all the magical families of Britain, Scotland, Ireland, France, Germany and Russia. The back side showed how the Sacred Twenty-Eight related to mundane nobility, too. Aunt Petunia was sure to be right at it, what with her fascination with genealogy.</p>
<p>The wand shop was outright creepy. Most of the wands seemed reluctant to allow him to touch. The one that Mr. Ollivander finally sold him felt… off… in Harry's hand. Not wrong, precisely. It was strong and warm and lovely but there was a kind of thrum in the background of his mind that seemed to say 'no, no, no, no' over and over and over.</p>
<p>His new owl was perfect.</p>
<p>Once back on the train for home, Harry pulled out the genealogy chart, tracing Draco's family and blinking that he was distantly related to Draco. Hm. Perhaps he should be more polite next time he spoke to Draco. Maybe. He was a prat. Harry really wasn't sure he wanted to spend more time around Draco, distant relative or not.</p>
<p>Then he traced the Potter family bloodline from himself back through dead relative after dead relative all the way to a daughter of Godric Gryffindor, one of the first founders of Hogwarts. That, it seemed given all the gold ink and scrollwork around his name, was Very Important, though Harry had no idea yet why. </p>
<p>What mattered to Harry was that he was alone. He really was the only Potter. But there were side lines and cousins and second-, third- and fourth-cousins of all kinds. And he apparently had a godfather or second adoptive father of some sort in one Sirius Black, not that the chart showed anything at all about him other than that he was from one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight families, just like Harry with the whole Gryffindor thing.</p>
<p>The mundane side of the chart was equally fascinating though one entry froze Harry in his seat for a good ten minutes. Then he scrambled into the etiquette books and the ones on the Sacred Twenty-Eight, reading desperately as the train sped towards home.</p>
<p>Oh, Aunt Petunia was going to be furious!</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Hagrid blew out a breath as he stood on the landing in front of Professor Dumbledore's office. Portkeys weren't as bad as those carts but Hagrid's stomach was still unsettled from the things. All that swooping and dropping. He shuddered. At least he'd done what he was supposed to and little Harry was off on his way back to his home.</p>
<p>"Ah, Hagrid," Professor Dumbledore said, startling Hagrid so badly he nearly elbowed Professor Dumbledore in the face. "Back from your trip?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Professor," Hagrid said with a little bob of his head even though Professor Dumbledore said that Hagrid didn't have to bow to him. It always felt odd not to show his respect after all that Professor Dumbledore had done for him. "Got yer package and got Harry all his things. Not so sure about that family of his, but it looked like an okay place. Well, mostly."</p>
<p>Professor Dumbledore frowned at Hagrid with concern that dimmed the twinkle in his eyes. "Why don't you come up to my office and tell me about it? I'd hate to think that something was wrong with our Harry."</p>
<p>Hagrid bobbed his head again and followed Dumbledore up the moving stair. It was a touch tight, especially at the door on the other side, but at least the walls of Hogwarts were good solid stone. He didn't need to worry about knocking doors loose or putting an elbow through the wall.</p>
<p>And, thankfully, Professor Dumbledore's chairs were spelled to be sturdy enough to hold Hagrid as well as magically expanding to meet his size. Made having a nice spot of tea downright pleasant instead of nerve-wracking. By the time Hagrid'd had his cup of tea, several lemon drops from Professor Dumbledore's desk and a tiny little biscuit that was powdery and a good bit too sweet for his taste, Hagrid's stomach had calmed down nicely.</p>
<p>"Now, do tell me all about it, Hagrid," Professor Dumbledore said.</p>
<p>His smile was a bit sharp but his eyes were so warm and twinkly and nice that Hagrid just nodded and started telling him all about the trip. The curtains and watching eyes made Dumbledore nod sagely. Apparently, that was just normal for a Muggle neighborhood. Poor Harry having to put up with that. The whole bit with Harry insisting on etiquette books and genealogy and those horrible Sacred Twenty-Eight books had Dumbledore frowning just as much as Hagrid.</p>
<p>"A spelled genealogy chart for all Magical and Muggle families?" Professor Dumbledore asked, interrupting for the first time.</p>
<p>"I know," Hagrid huffed. He flung a hand out, nearly knocking one of Dumbledore's sparkly bits of glass and metal and magic off the desk. "I tried to argue him out of it. That's not the sort of thing Harry needs. All those poncy Sacred Twenty-Eight types are dark as they come. But apparently his Aunt Petunia is all in on genealogy. He got it as a gift of some sort for her and another aunt of his. Madge? Marge? Think it was Marge. Yes, Aunt Marge who cares more about breeding and genealogy than she does about anything else."</p>
<p>"Hm, well, I suppose it's not a problem if it was a present," Professor Dumbledore said, but he frowned like it was a really big problem.</p>
<p>Hagrid slumped in his chair. "I'm sorry, Professor. I really tried to talk him out of it. Even yelled and nearly got us thrown out, but Harry was so determined to get it."</p>
<p>"Don't worry about it, Hagrid," Professor Dumbledore said. "It will be fine. I'm sure that Harry will be just what we expect when he gets here. His parents were such Light people, so fierce in their defense of our world. Harry is sure to take after them."</p>
<p>He reached across his desk to pat Hagrid's hand. Just the touch calmed Hagrid down a lot. The warm look on Dumbledore's face helped even more. Hagrid smiled and nodded, then nodded a bit more strongly as his worries slowly faded away. Somehow, talking with Professor Dumbledore always made him feel better.</p>
<p>Such a great man. Hagrid was so lucky to be able to stay at Hogwarts. Not the best position in the world, maybe, but Hagrid wouldn't want to be anywhere else.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Professor," Hagrid said.</p>
<p>"You're always welcome, Hagrid," Professor Dumbledore said with a wonderful smile, so bright and charming. Just pulled Hagrid right in, like he always did. "I did have another task I'd like your help with. Well, actually, it's something I'd like to have Fluffy's help with, actually."</p>
<p>Hagrid blinked, instantly worried. "What could you need a full-grown Cerberus for, Professor Dumbledore? Fluffy's a good dog, but I don't think he should be around the kids. They wouldn’t know how to handle him. And he's never been very good at tolerating small squeaky things. The first years'd be as small and squeaky as a frightened rabbit and you know how he likes to eat his rabbits."</p>
<p>Messily, alive and tearing them between the three heads, even though a rabbit was barely a morsel for just one of Fluffy's heads. Dumbledore nodded reassuringly.</p>
<p>"I quite agree," Professor Dumbledore said. "The children wouldn't be anywhere near him. There's simply something that I must protect over the school year and it occurred to me that no one could get past Fluffy."</p>
<p>Hagrid fidgeted in the chair that suddenly didn't feel half strong or big enough. "Inside, sir? Fluffy's so big. He'd not be happy being cooped up inside, you know. Make him all snappish. I'd hate to have his heads start biting one another out of boredom or fear."</p>
<p>"We'll plan his place so that you can provide him with everything he needs, Hagrid," Professor Dumbledore said in a much sterner tone. "It really is quite vital. I can't trust anyone else with this task, much as I couldn't trust anyone else with that errand at the bank."</p>
<p>Hagrid started and began patting his pockets. Took him a bit to find the little package with its plain brown paper and twine holding it shut. He held it, frowning, before slowly passing it over to Professor Dumbledore. The hesitation was little enough, but Professor Dumbledore all but snatched it out of his hand once Hagrid reached across the desk.</p>
<p>Their fingers brushed together and the twinkling in Professor Dumbledore's eyes increased as he smiled gently at Hagrid. Really, what had he been so upset about? During winter, all Fluffy wanted to do was curl up and sleep. Didn't even eat that much. Hagrid could go visit him every day, morning and night, play music for him and take him for walkies in the Forbidden Forest. It wasn't that big of a problem to have Fluffy around the children.</p>
<p>"When do you need Fluffy?" Hagrid asked, taking another lemon drop when Professor Dumbledore shook the little dish at him. Still too sweet but the lemon flavor was quite nice.</p>
<p>"Very soon," Professor Dumbledore said as Hagrid sighed and crunched the lemon drop between his teeth. It went to powder and Dumbledore smiled more deeply at Hagrid. "Very soon. Let's make sure that we can get him all settled before school starts, shall we?"</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>Harry ran into Privet Drive panting from rushing all the way from the train station. The door slammed behind him. Uncle Vernon bellowed. Dudley shouted. Harry ignored them both.</p>
<p>No Aunt Petunia. Where was she? He needed to tell her!</p>
<p>"Boy, what's wrong?" Uncle Vernon asked so warily that Harry ran one hand over his hair. It twisted and moved under his palms. "You stop that! Stop that right now."</p>
<p>"Aunt Petunia!" Harry shouted.</p>
<p>She made an annoyed noise in the kitchen. Harry ran in, setting his owl on the kitchen table even though Aunt Petunia gasped in horror at such impropriety. He started pulling books out of his bag, piling them up while scrambling for the ones he needed. None of them came out at first because he was so rattled that he couldn't focus and picture the ones he wanted.</p>
<p>The stacks grew until they teetered and still Harry didn't have the ones he wanted, darn it.</p>
<p>"What is going on in here?" Uncle Vernon demanded. "Boy, you explain right now or so help me it's into your cupboard and no supper!"</p>
<p>"I want an owl!" Dudley demanded. "Why does he get an owl and I don't?"</p>
<p>Harry shook his head while breathing slowly, deliberately. His hands still shook no matter what he tried. When he looked at Aunt Petunia, Harry was sure that his eyes were doing the thing. They had to be. He felt like he must be glowing with magic. It skittered over his skin, plucking at his hand-me-down clothes and thrumming through the bookbag that just wouldn't give him the books he needed.</p>
<p>"What?" Aunt Petunia asked so warily that both Uncle Vernon and Dudley stepped back.</p>
<p>Harry paused, bottom lip quivering. "Aunt Petunia, did my mum come back from Hogwarts and claim that there's no rank among wizard folk?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Aunt Petunia said with the little sniff of disdain that'd made Draco flinch so hard. "I never believed it."</p>
<p>"You were right," Harry said. He finally found the genealogy chart and the book on the Sacred Twenty-Eight. "She lied to you. I don't know why but she did. She lied and… here. Read this. And this!"</p>
<p>He flopped into one the kitchen chairs as Aunt Petunia studied the genealogy chart. She gasped when she hit Harry's distant but still significant relationship to the royal family by way of a distaff and wrong-side-of-the-sheets ancestor. Then she made a wounded noise when she scanned over the rules of the Sacred Twenty-Eight that stated that each of their members, especially the heads of houses, counted the same as nobility as far as the government and the Queen were concerned.</p>
<p>While there were no formal titles, at all, the top four, descended from Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff, counted as royal Dukes. The next six who came a generation later were equal to Marquess. Then there were four families that held ranks equal to Earl, six of Viscount and eight who were Barons.</p>
<p>Gryffindor had died out other than one daughter who married into the Potter line and now Harry was the last descendant of that line. Slytherin was presumed dead since the Gaunts fell into squibs, whatever that was, but Hufflepuff still existed in the Bones family and Ravenclaw in the Fawley family.</p>
<p>Draco's father Lucius Malfoy wasn't even an Earl-equivalent. He was just rich and of Baron-equivalent like Uncle Vernon's parents. But he might have been at the Marquess level if Sirius Black hadn't become godfather / adopted second father to Harry.</p>
<p>All of which meant that Harry was of a Certain Level of Society on two fronts.</p>
<p>And he knew nothing at all about how to handle it.</p>
<p>"Vernon!" Aunt Petunia gasped. </p>
<p>She collapsed into a chair opposite Harry, sending both Uncle Vernon and Dudley scrambling to see just what'd set both of them on their ears. Uncle Vernon got it immediately. He went purple-red and then porridge-white as he groaned and sat next to Aunt Petunia. It took Dudley muttering and tracing the lines with his fingers while cross-referencing against the Sacred Twenty-Eight for him to suddenly gasp.</p>
<p>"You're a duke?" Dudley squawked. "That's not fair!"</p>
<p>"It's worse," Harry told Dudley. "Don't you remember the way the principle frowned at you the last week of school? The way he hums and watches me? He keeps saying what it pity it is. I didn't know what he meant until now."</p>
<p>Dudley stared at Harry. "Wait. You mean people know about this?"</p>
<p>"The Potter family holds rank on this side of things, too," Harry said. "I'm a Duke for mundane people and for magical people, too. So, people have been looking at us, all of us, and wondering why exactly I'm here. Why I'm living his way, why Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia don't do more for us. That's why everyone expects Uncle Vernon to pay for things all the time. I'm a Duke so of course there must be more money. It's… They're all watching and judging us because my mum didn't tell Aunt Petunia who my father, fathers, really were. There should've been more money, more training, more… more stuff happening."</p>
<p>"That man!" Aunt Petunia shouted, slapping her palm against the table so hard that all three of them flinched. "I asked Dumbledore and I asked him for someone to help train you properly. I asked him for someone to come check to see if you were growing up right. He kept saying that it would be fine, that there was no need, that you would be better off without it."</p>
<p>"He promised to help pay for you to stay here," Uncle Vernon grumbled more quietly than he normally did when complaining about the money Harry took out of their mouths. "Never saw a single penny out of him. Welshed on the whole deal and ran off."</p>
<p>"There's an entire trust vault designated for my care," Harry said slowly. He waved at his stacks of books and his bookbag. "That's how I bought all this. Well, not my owl. That was a birthday present from Hagrid so that I could send letters."</p>
<p>Dudley frowned at the book again, his thick fingers tapping against it for a moment. He frowned and frowned and then straightened up to stare at Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. It wasn't the temper tantrum face. Nor the working on getting angry face. It wasn't even Dudley's playing it like he was slower and stupider so people wouldn't expect things out of him face. Harry didn't recognize this face.</p>
<p>"Mum, Dad, do we need Aunt Marge to explain this?" Dudley asked. "She knows all this stuff. It's her hobby. Maybe she can explain why Harry didn't get what he was supposed to. Or why we didn't, either."</p>
<p>Harry hummed and nodded even though he really, truly hated Aunt Marge and her horrible dog. "It's affecting Uncle Vernon's work, Aunt Petunia. I know people are asking questions about it. I think… you might need to have a bridge party or something so you can complain about all the secrets my mum kept from you. And. And yeah, you guys probably need training on how to behave right. I certainly do."</p>
<p>He leaned back as Aunt Petunia stood, her face sharp and fierce, her eyes snapping with fury. Uncle Vernon scrambled to his feet, fidgeting as much as his bulk would allow him. When Aunt Petunia put out a hand, Uncle Vernon took it. His hand dwarfed hers, but Harry didn't think anyone would mistake who was in charge as Aunt Petunia raised her chin.</p>
<p>"Call Marge," Aunt Petunia ordered. "Harry and I will be heading back to London to get what we need. Tell Marge about the mundane side of things, Vernon. Tell her that you need training to be able to work at that level of society. With your new position, you'll need it anyway. Tell her Lily lied to me about it all because she did. Clearly."</p>
<p>"Yes, Pet," Uncle Vernon said. "Dudley, go call Marge!"</p>
<p>Dudley ran for the phone. Harry pushed all his books back into his bag, taking everything including the book on the Sacred Twenty-Eight. He did leave the genealogy chart behind. Aunt Petunia studied it, frowning, and then passed it to Harry.</p>
<p>"Dudley," Aunt Petunia called, "tell her to bring all her books on the royal bloodlines and the House of Lords!"</p>
<p>"Yes, Mum!"</p>
<p>She turned to Harry, scowling. "Breathe. Your eyes and hair are a disaster, Harry. You must stay calm while we're in London."</p>
<p>"Sorry, Aunt Petunia," Harry said. "I'm just… It's hard. And I think the rules in magical society are very, very different."</p>
<p>She nodded. "We'll find out. I won't let you be a disgrace. Not to our family and certainly not to your own, even if my perfect little sister decided I didn't need to know something so important."</p>
<p>"I got new clothes," Harry announced. "Ones that are right for the magical world."</p>
<p>"Go change," Aunt Petunia immediately ordered. "We're leaving in five minutes so don't dawdle."</p>
<p>Harry ran for the stairs. If he never had to wear Dudley's hand-me-downs again, he'd be grateful. Even though he was kind of furious about all the things he didn't know and had apparently been kept from learning all his life. No matter how Hagrid praised Dumbledore, Harry thought he might not trust the man. What sort of professor deliberately denied a child knowledge and the money he needed to survive?</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Adrian Flourish looked up as the front door chime sounded. He'd charmed the thing to warn him when certain sorts came into Flourish and Blotts. One too many encounter between that Malfoy and Arthur Weasley during shopping for Arthur's children's books had made warning not just prudent, but necessary.</p>
<p>This one wasn't either Arthur or Malfoy.</p>
<p>Dumbledore smiled like a sapphire blue shark with silver roses scattered across it as he strolled up to the counter where Mr. Flourish sat. Still hadn't realized that Adrian had charmed the desk to prevent anyone from affecting his mind.</p>
<p>"Good afternoon, Headmaster," Adrian said with a professionally welcoming smile. "Looking for something new for your collection?"</p>
<p>"Not today, Adrian," Dumbledore said with his own professionally stiff smile. "Hagrid came in with a student today and some of his comments had me a bit concerned. It was the first time he'd escorted a student so I wanted to be sure that it went as it should."</p>
<p>Adrian nodded slowly. "I did wonder why Hagrid was accompanying a student. Looking to move him up in the world?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps," Dumbledore replied in a tone that said 'oh, definitely not'. "How did he work with our Harry?"</p>
<p>"Mmm, a bit overbearing about Mr. Potter's personal reading choices," Adrian said thoughtfully because it was quite true. "Apparently, Mr. Potter's aunts are quite the genealogy buffs. He bought a few gifts for them and Hagrid was somewhat… irate… about it. I almost had to throw them out."</p>
<p>"And young Harry?" Dumbledore asked with a snarl that his twinkling eyes spell would have hidden from most everyone else.</p>
<p>"A very nice young man," Adrian said. "Quiet, respectful. The only time he showed much in the way of a display was getting the genealogy information. It would be quite nice if all young people had such manners. I'd have fewer problems in the store, if so."</p>
<p>That pleased Dumbledore enough that his smile was quite real. Interesting. Adrian was going to do his best to ensure that Dumbledore didn't learn everything Mr. Potter had bought. Knowing how the old busy-body liked to meddle, he'd ensure that the poor young man never learned a thing about his role in society.</p>
<p>Dumbledore might not want the Potter family to regain their family magic and legacy, but Adrian did. He'd spent too many generations already watching the children come in ignorant and grow up even more ignorant. Only a handful of people ever asked after ritual magic books or the real histories of magic that he'd taken to keeping in the back room to keep the Ministry and that little toad Umbridge from objecting.</p>
<p>"I'm glad it went so well," Dumbledore said. "Anything else?"</p>
<p>Adrian waved one hand casually. "Nothing that you don't get from a very large and excitable man with a very young and overwhelmed boy. I do think they had ice cream before coming in. Hagrid had traces in his beard. That might have contributed to the high emotions."</p>
<p>Dumbledore nodded as if he was a sage. His nasty little smile was probably intended to be seen as kindly and grandfatherly. So ridiculous when Adrian had six grandchildren and Dumbledore none. They were of an age. Behaving like that to Adrian was the outside of enough.</p>
<p>"I'll let you get back to work, then," Dumbledore said. "Do let me know if you remember anything important."</p>
<p>Adrian nodded. "Of course. When your last order comes in, I'll send you an owl. Would you like it sent direct rather than coming to pick it up?"</p>
<p>"I'd hate to miss a chance to chat," Dumbledore said with a bright little nod towards Mr. Flourish that set his teeth on edge. "Thank you for your time, Adrian."</p>
<p>He swept out of the shop, the roses on his ridiculous robe shifting into thistles and vines decorated with grapes. Adrian shook his head and set to work removing every single monitoring, listening and control spell Dumbledore had put on his shop. Every single time. Every time the man visited, Adrian had to waste a day's time breaking spells just because Dumbledore couldn't keep his big nose out of everyone else's business.</p>
<p>"Annoying man," Mr. Flourish grumbled. "Just wish I knew how he did it. I thought I had the wards set up so that he wouldn't be able to do it again."</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>Diagon Alley looked different with Aunt Petunia by his side. The drive into London had been completely silent. Harry hadn't wanted to say anything as he worked to calm down enough that his hair stopped doing the thing and Aunt Petunia's white-knuckled grip on the steering wheel forbade it, anyway.</p>
<p>The wonder of his first entrance into the Alley had faded a bit with everything Harry had discovered since. It was still amazing, still beautiful and strange and so tempting, but it was also darker and scarier. Harry wasn't sure what the adults thought as he held Aunt Petunia's hand and walked up the Alley towards Gringotts. The glances that came Aunt Petunia's way were arch, snide, a little overbearingly magical as people's eyes glittered into strange colors and their voices hummed in odd ways.</p>
<p>Aunt Petunia raised her chin and sniffed back at them as if they were being shockingly rude. Which, honestly, they were. None of them seemed to see it until Harry frowned at them with his eyes sparkling. Then they looked away, shame flitting across their faces.</p>
<p>"Hasn't changed a bit in all these years," Aunt Petunia observed as she led Harry towards Gringotts.</p>
<p>"You can see it now, then," Harry observed to Aunt Petunia.</p>
<p>"Oh, I could see it before," Aunt Petunia said so bitterly that he stared up at her. "Lily showed us all of it. Our parents could only see it if Lily was there, but I could always see magical things. I'm a squib. I can see magic easily. I just can't open the way in. I can't use a wand or do magic thus I'm not allowed in their precious little Alley. It's warded against squibs who aren't escorted by someone magical since all the entrances require a wand."</p>
<p>"What?" Harry squawked. "But why?"</p>
<p>He still wasn't sure what a squib was but to be able to see this and then be forbidden from visiting seemed cruel. Aunt Petunia shook her head as she tugged him up Gringotts' stairs. Maybe he could ask about it later. Or read some more. He really wanted to read all his books as quickly as he could. And go back for more because there had been dozens that he saw that looked like they might be helpful. It hadn't been worth battling Hagrid to get them at the time. Maybe Aunt Petunia would let him go back for them now?</p>
<p>The goblins at the door eyed them both narrowly but no one objected as they went in. Inside, there were fewer wizards and witches around. Harry supposed that made sense. It was nearly suppertime. Despite that, the goblins were still working away counting money, writing in registers and sneering at the wizards who came for their money.</p>
<p>"Business?" the goblin asked when they got to the head of the line.</p>
<p>"I'd like to see if Harry Potter has an account manager," Aunt Petunia said. "There's some irregularities that were just brought to our attention that need to be addressed."</p>
<p>"Hmm." The goblin studied Harry who swallowed and tried his best not to make his eyes glow or his hair twist or anything. The goblins didn't seem like a magical tantrum would impress them. "And does Mr. Potter have his key?"</p>
<p>"No, sir," Harry said. "I'm very sorry but Hagrid kept that. I've never had it."</p>
<p>The goblin sat back a little, staring at Harry before frowning at Aunt Petunia who just thinned her lips and sniffed disapprovingly as if the very concept of someone else having Harry's key was as offensive as dog poop on the bottom of her shoe. "I see. One moment please."</p>
<p>He wrote a note on a small piece of parchment. When he placed it in a box in front of him, the parchment disappeared. A few moments later a goblin marched up and waved for them to follow him deeper into the bank.</p>
<p>This time, they walked rather than taking one of the rumbling rollercoaster carts. They went down a flight of stairs, down a long hallway carved out of rock where you could see the individual chisel marks. Then there were six big vault doors separated by tunnels marked by increasingly smoothly carved walls. </p>
<p>Finally, they were deposited in an office where a goblin with white hair that stood up like a cloud on his head, a fierce scowl and a very, very fine suit sat waiting. The goblin who'd escorted them stared at Harry's account manager like Uncle Vernon stared at Aunt Petunia when she was all dressed up for a dinner party. Harry couldn't see why. The goblin did have very long, very shiny claws but his face was even more ugly than the other goblins Harry had seen. Maybe goblins had different ideas of what was beautiful?</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," the goblin said. He studied Harry as if he was a bug and then frowned at Aunt Petunia who still hadn't let go of Harry's hand. "Mrs. Dursley. I did not expect to see you today. I am Silverclaw, the Potter Account Manager. Please sit. We have a great deal to cover. Your failure to respond to our statements and accounting requests on the timed payments is an issue."</p>
<p>"We never got any payments so I don't know what accounting requests you might be referring to," Aunt Petunia snapped at him. She sat with her purse perched on her lap as if she expected to need to snatch it up and beat someone with it at any moment. "We certainly have never received any statements for any accounts. That's part of why we're here. My sister lied to me about the Potter family's level in society. We've been educating the boy completely wrong all these years and no one from the magical world has come to check on him at all."</p>
<p>Silverclaw sat back sharply, his hands flexing on the table so that his claws clicked against the surface. "No one?"</p>
<p>"Ever," Aunt Petunia agreed. Her single nod was as stern as a judge proclaiming sentence on a murderer on the telly.</p>
<p>"…I see. One moment please." </p>
<p>Silverclaw wrote a rather long note on a piece of parchment. It flashed away once he put it into the box on his desk. Three very long minutes passed with Aunt Petunia answering Silverclaw's increasingly annoyed questions about just what she had been told, what Harry had been told and how they'd finally found out that something was wrong.</p>
<p>A piece of parchment flashed into Silverclaw's box. He picked it up and nodded with satisfaction.</p>
<p>"A full accounting of the Potter, Black and Evans vaults is now in progress," Silverclaw declared. "I have been authorized to approve charge cards for you and your husband, Mrs. Dursley. They will take their funds from the Evans vault which is very liquid. Your sister's investments were wisely chosen. As long as you stay within a reasonable level of spending, you should be solvent for a very long time. There will be a second charge card for you to use in the mundane world, Mr. Potter. We are in the process of creating new keys for you to use in the magical world, having recalled the lost ones. Never allow someone else to have access to your keys."</p>
<p>"Um, plural?" Harry asked.</p>
<p>Silverclaw smiled. It was not a nice smile at all, but it was one that felt very much like one of Aunt Petunia's smiles when she got a hand up on the other women during one of her bridge games.</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, Mr. Potter," Silverclaw said. "You have multiple vaults, trust, hereditary and familial, and thus multiple keys. An account book is being prepared for both of you. It is automatically updating and will show exactly what progress has been made on the audit as well as where the audit has been stymied. Do you wish to have the Potter will read?"</p>
<p>Aunt Petunia huffed. "I didn't know that Lily had a will. Of course we need a reading of her will! I always told her that I didn't want to be part of this world but that if she needed me, I'd be there."</p>
<p>"Why not, Aunt Petunia?" Harry whispered because Silverclaw's glower had him twitching on his seat.</p>
<p>Aunt Petunia sighed. All the anger seemed to drain away and she suddenly looked much younger than she had. Well, other than the terrible wrinkles around her mouth and between her eyebrows.</p>
<p>"It hurts to see something you can't ever have, Harry," Aunt Petunia murmured. "I never want Dudley to see any of this. I… believe that he's a squib, too, and it would just hurt him."</p>
<p>Harry wasn't so sure Dudley would agree with that. Dudley wanted everything he saw, whether it was good for him or not. Just knowing that Harry got to go off and do magical things would have Dudley pitching fits. He'd been whining about Harry getting to go to a different school ever since the letter got read. Hagrid showing up had shut him up briefly but that was all.</p>
<p>Still…</p>
<p>If Harry had been the one who had to know about all of this and then never be allowed to even visit, he'd be stroppy, too. Aunt Petunia had been shown this world, lied to about it, maybe, and then denied access ever since.</p>
<p>"Um, Silverclaw, sir?" Harry said. "Is there any way that my aunt can have access to Diagon Alley and the bank? I'm going to be away at school and if something comes up, she'll have to deal with it. It's not right that she can't get in without someone to escort her."</p>
<p>Silverclaw stared at him which was easier do deal with than Aunt Petunia's scowl. "That is an excellent point, Mr. Potter. We will arrange a mail box for you and for your aunt. There is a small maintenance fee, but it will afford her access in writing to me and to you. No one will be able to intercept mail delivered this way, which apparently has been happening with the regular channels. Personal access is not something we can guarantee at Gringotts, unless you're willing to fund an escort for her."</p>
<p>"Is it very expensive, sir?" Harry asked.</p>
<p>"The fee is nominal," Silverclaw declared. </p>
<p>He pulled a piece of parchment out of a drawer and passed it to them. It showed a list of personal services Gringotts provided to its patrons, none of which seemed terribly expensive other than legal and accounting services, though the fee for personal shopping was rather higher than Harry expected. It might be worth it to get those books he wanted, though. </p>
<p>Silverclaw tapped the bottom of the list which listed a five knut fee for an escort for any underage magical or squib who required access to Diagon Alley. There was an extra five knuts if you wanted your escort to be able to defend you.</p>
<p>"That's… that's not bad, is it?" Harry asked Aunt Petunia.</p>
<p>"It seems very reasonable to me," Aunt Petunia said though she frowned at the list. "Can we have a copy of this list? Two copies, actually."</p>
<p>"Done," Silverclaw declared as he scribbled something on another piece of parchment. "If you decide you need any other services, please send me a message. The boxes will be ready for you when you return to the lobby. We shall go collect Mr. Potter's keys now. Would you like a key to the Evans vault, Mrs. Dursley?"</p>
<p>Aunt Petunia's lips pursed so hard that her mouth looked like a shriveled prune. After a moment, she nodded hard, once. Silverclaw hummed and added to his parchment which he dropped in the box. As soon as it flashed away, he waved for them to come with him.</p>
<p>They marched through tunnels, down several flights of stairs, and then into a large room full of small cauldrons set over blazing hot fires. There were goblins working at each of those cauldrons, talking in a harsh language that Harry didn't recognize at all. Aunt Petunia's hand tightened on Harry's, but she didn't yank him along when he slowed nor did she snap at him.</p>
<p>Getting keys made was very simple. There was a small metal tray that had rough key outlines in it. You had to prick your finger with a special knife, which didn't hurt at all, and let drops of blood fall into the molten gold. Aunt Petunia had to give one drop of blood. Harry had to give eight which, he supposed, meant that he'd get eight keys and thus had eight vaults. The idea of that much money and stuff tucked away somewhere under Gringotts was intimidating to put it mildly.</p>
<p>The goblin making Aunt Petunia's key murmured something in his harsh language before tipping the cauldron to pour the molten gold into her tray. It was just barely larger than a standard skeleton key. Harry's cauldron and tray were much larger, about the size of his head instead of the size of his fist like Aunt Petunia's. When it was his turn, it took eight separate pours and a constant stream of muttered magic before keys formed in his tray.</p>
<p>Aunt Petunia's key was a very simple, very modern looking key. It was sleek, unremarkable, and completely unornamented.</p>
<p>Harry's keys varied widely. One had a lion's head. Another had a twisting snake on the shaft. Three of them had bits of furniture engraved on the loop end of them. Not one was simple or plain or unremarkable.</p>
<p>"Dudley's going to want to steal every single one of these," Harry observed with despair.</p>
<p>"Gringotts offers wallets, Mr. Potter," Silverclaw said. He gathered up Harry's keys and passed them over in a clump. "I suggest strongly that you get one that will allow you to mate it to your magic so that no one else can see or use it. The remaining gold will be saved in case any other keys need to be made in the future. This is true for both of you, Mrs. Dursley. If any of your grandchildren have magic, they will be able to gain access to the Evans vault with your permission."</p>
<p>"Good," Aunt Petunia said but she didn't look like she thought it was good at all.</p>
<p>"I think I would like a wallet, sir," Harry said rather than ask if Aunt Petunia was okay. "Thank you for suggesting it."</p>
<p>All three of the goblins smiled at him. They weren't terribly nice smiles, but it wasn't like Aunt Marge smiling at him before she got ready to let Ripper loose on him, so Harry decided that he wasn't going to fuss over it. Silverclaw led them away, back towards the lobby of the bank.</p>
<p>"Um, we were hoping to find someone who could give me lessons on how to behave properly in the magical world," Harry said. He could hear the hum of voices in the lobby, so they didn't have much time left before they had to go back out into Diagon Alley. "Do you have suggestions about how to do that?"</p>
<p>"The Potter family seneschal has been summoned, Mr. Potter," Silverclaw said. "He is waiting for you in the lobby. I would suggest talking to him about what can and should be done to deal with the irregularities of your placement with your aunt and uncle. He will also want to discuss the reading of your parents' will."</p>
<p>"Oh, good," Harry said, deeply relieved that Silverclaw had already thought of it. "Thank you very much, sir."</p>
<p>Once again, he got that nasty smile that curved the lips but didn't expose any teeth. Really, they needed to go back to Flourish and Blotts to get some books on goblins and how to behave around them. All this guessing was making Harry's stomach churn with nerves.</p>
<p>Just before they entered the lobby, Silverclaw pulled the two of them into a little side office full of small wooden boxes, jewelry displays aand bookshelves packed with leather-bound books. He gave Aunt Petunia her mail box and Harry his mail box. The boxes were very small, about the size of a small notebook, and very plain with just a lid that latched. Silverclaw then helped Harry match his brand-new key wallet to his magic. It was an amazing little thing that looked like a regular wallet, but it had a pocket inside with slots to hold each key. Once he put it in his trouser pocket, it disappeared. Patting his pocket didn't reveal it. Only putting his hand back into his pocket with the intent to get his wallet made it come back.</p>
<p>"Is it tied to me or to these trousers, sir?" Harry asked once he'd tested it four or five times just to make sure he had it right.</p>
<p>Silverclaw's tight-lipped smile was a bit more obviously amused this time. "It is tied to you, Mr. Potter. You need not fear that you will leave it in your pocket and send it through the wash."</p>
<p>"Oh, good," Harry said. "Um. Aunt Petunia, do you want one or would a necklace for it be better?"</p>
<p>Her breath caught as her lips went tight. She shook her head sharply, not at Harry or his question but at something that he didn't quite understand. Either way, she nodded to Silverclaw who opened a drawer carved right into the wall.</p>
<p>"I would suggest a storage bracelet, actually," Silverclaw said. He pulled a sleek gold one that looked much like Aunt Petunia's key. "It will only hold your key, but it does not require a wand or active magic to use. Additionally, it can be paired to you, personally, Mrs. Dursley."</p>
<p>"That's perfect," Aunt Petunia said. "Thank you."</p>
<p>Once Silverclaw cast a muttering spell that made the bracelet glow for a second, Aunt Petunia put it on and pressed her key against it. It disappeared with a flash. She seemed to have no interest in pulling it out until Harry stared up at her quizzically. Then she rolled her eyes, sighed and pulled it out again.</p>
<p>"Satisfied?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Aunt Petunia," Harry said. He smiled.</p>
<p>"Good," Aunt Petunia said. "Let's go. We've still got far too much to do to dawdle, Harry."</p>

  <p>Silverclaw marched through the bank's tunnels, going deeper until he reached the gate to the goblin's hidden entrance to their realm. He presented his ID, was passed through, and then strode onwards into the star-filled dusk of their homeland. The sky overhead was lavender-black, dark and velvet other than the gently burning stars that lit everything Silverclaw could see.</p>
<p>The path to Ragnok's office shimmered under Silverclaw's feet, indicating that he'd been approved to meet with Ragnok already. Someone in the forges or accounting department must have had the insight to warn Ragnok that Harry Potter had returned to the magical world.</p>
<p>A second time.</p>
<p>Interesting, that. The visit with Hagrid had been so very irregular that Silverclaw hadn't been at all surprised that Mr. Potter hadn't come to ask about or report on his accounts. Finding out that he hadn't known a thing about the Potter vaults, well.</p>
<p>That was very valuable information.</p>
<p>Ragnok's office sat in a magically created dome of crystal. It glowed softly, rainbows of light shimmering around it in response to Ragnok's moods. If he was calm, the color moved slowly, gently. If not, it flashed as distractingly as the bioluminescence of one of the shadow-dwelling land crabs.</p>
<p>Right now, it throbbed like the pulse of a headache in your temple after dealing with Dumbledore and his dramatics. Appropriately enough. Silverclaw waited at the threshold until Ragnok looked up from the reports on his obsidian desk to wave him in.</p>
<p>"Silverclaw," Ragnok said, peering at him. "You have news? I've got multiple requests for full audits on accounts that were 'sealed'."</p>
<p>Silverclaw smiled tightly at his king, nodding once as he folded his hands over his belly. "I do. Harry Potter was placed with his squib aunt Petunia Dursley as we were told. The payments which have been disbursed over the last eleven years, however, never made it to them. Harry Potter is small, rather fragile and his magic has a shadow over it. I couldn't see what exactly that shadow was. Mrs. Dursley is rather like a dragon. No one was getting close to the boy to examine him without being bitten."</p>
<p>"Hmm," Ragnok grunted while studying the audit requests. Plus at least ten reports of Mr. Potter's visits, from a half-dozen different departments. "Any idea what her expression of magic is?"</p>
<p>"None," Silverclaw said. He smiled again as Ragnok's head came up sharply. "I've rarely met someone with magic so well-controlled. She may not have been formally trained but she's done well for herself nonetheless. I would expect no less from Lily Potter's older sister."</p>
<p>Ragnok tapped his desk thoughtfully. His claws were dull slate, sharp of course, but nothing to look at like Silverclaw's. Not that it mattered whether Ragnok was attractive. He ruled by claw and by magic and by brain, not by a pretty turn of face.</p>
<p>"You will take extra precautions against Dumbledore," Ragnok ordered. His eyes narrowed when Silverclaw stiffened. "I've already had one Goblin corrupted by the wizard. I will not allow another to be. Extra precautions, paid for by the Hoard. I suspect that the prophecies of a turn of fate for the Goblin Nation tie into Mr. Potter. We must be sure that he and his accounts are handled properly."</p>
<p>Silverclaw nodded, a bit mollified by the explanation if not the lack of confidence in his abilities. "It shall be done. Has anything worked with Griphook?"</p>
<p>Ragnok's scowl answered the question. They shared a moment of teeth-gnashing for the loss of one of the Hoard and then Silverclaw nodded to Ragnok to request permission to bring up another issue. He waited until Ragnok nodded permission.</p>
<p>"Should I allow a meeting with Dumbledore?"</p>
<p>"No," Ragnok said. "We will put him off as long as we can. If you must meet with Dumbledore, it will only be in new-carved chambers that will be destroyed once he has left. The wizard has power that he should not. None of my attempts to discover the reason for his abilities has paid off the investment yet. Take no risks. Do not interact with him. Support Mrs. Dursley and Mr. Potter in every way you can."</p>
<p>"It shall be done," Silverclaw said.</p>
<p>His bow was deeper this time. Silverclaw waited for the tapped signal for him to leave, not smiling that Ragnok left him bent for a while longer than was standard. He knew how he looked, after all, and Ragnok, while married and a king, was only a goblin at his core.</p>
<p>Eventually, after Ragnok had looked his fill, Silverclaw was given permission to leave. He left, letting his claws tap together as he exited Ragnok's crystalline office. A bit flirtatious for a married Goblin, certainly, but Ragnok was king.</p>
<p>Power did grant some privileges and Silverclaw would be a fool not to allow minor flirtatation, as long as it went no farther than a bit of staring. Having the favor of the king went far to increasing one's coffers after all.</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>The Potter family's seneschal was actually Muggleborn. Harry hadn't expected that. They'd gone through a fireplace in Gringotts in a blaze of green fire that spun Harry so badly he would've fallen if it weren't for Aunt Petunia's death-grip on his hand. She'd held herself rigid and was able to step out without stumbling at all. Harry stumbled but he didn't fall thanks to her.</p>
<p>Mr. Amal Swashlin was a short, swarthy man with thick curling hair and perfectly round glasses that were mirrored to hide the color of his eyes. Harry stared at his glasses for a moment before turning to Aunt Petunia.</p>
<p>"I think I need glasses like his, Aunt Petunia," Harry said.</p>
<p>"Well, now that you have funds, that's possible," Aunt Petunia said with a little snort. "Let me explain what's happened, Mr. Swashlin. There's a great deal to be covered and very little time."</p>
<p>"Of course," Mr. Swashlin said as he pulled out a yellow legal pad and a lovely fountain pen that wrote in purple ink. "Please, go right ahead."</p>
<p>The notes started quite simple and brief but quickly went scribbly and furious as Aunt Petunia explained the whole long mess of events, discoveries and revelations. Harry sat quietly, letting her cover it all. He was still shaking inside because of the discovery that he was supposed to be a duke. </p>
<p>It seemed impossible. Granted, they said at school that there were quite a few nobles who really had no more money than an average person but if his father's bloodline had been dukes there must be property or something, right? Beyond the vaults that they'd just found out about, of course. Shouldn't there be an ancestral hall or castle or something? Why in the world were they all living in Little Winging?</p>
<p>At the very least, he was going to need to learn how to vote in the House of Lords. The magical side of things was even more confusing, what with the Gryffindor legacy and the Black family thing that Harry was going to have to deal with.</p>
<p>"I can't believe that you weren't told anything," Mr. Swashlin finally said when Aunt Petunia finished her recitation.</p>
<p>"Not a word," Aunt Petunia said. Her lips looked even more prune-like than normal. "I've asked Dumbledore repeatedly for someone to come and check on Harry. The best he's done is to have Harry go spend some time with Arabella Figg who lives up the street. As if a squib like Arabella could tell anything about how Harry's developing!"</p>
<p>"He does… need some proper medical care," Mr. Swashlin said. His glasses flashed for a moment as he studied Harry, revealing brown eyes that glowed honey-gold before the glasses went mirrored once more. "There's something about his aura that gives me pause."</p>
<p>"We'll have to arrange it ourselves," Aunt Petunia said with a tired sigh. " We need someone to ensure that he's properly healthy in general. We got no information at all on any vaccinations he should have which is just the outside of enough. We also need to get Harry a tutor for how to behave in the magical world. And we definitely need to have Lily's will read."</p>
<p>Mr. Swashlin nodded as he took notes. "All easily accomplished, Mrs. Dursley. How soon would you like the will read?"</p>
<p>"Do we know who should be there?" Harry asked, thinking of some of Aunt Petunia's afternoon shows where a will reading was held and all the beneficiaries gathered together and then there was drama and murder and excitement. "I mean, if this Dumbledore person is supposed to be there, I kind of don't want to give him a chance to stop us from doing stuff. He's already caused all sorts of trouble, hasn't he?"</p>
<p>Both Aunt Petunia and Mr. Swashlin studied him. Aunt Petunia's eyebrows went up before she nodded her agreement. Mr. Swashlin's glasses flashed three times. His eyes were honey-gold, then greenish, then almost black.</p>
<p>"A very good point, Mr. Potter," Mr. Swashlin said. "We may wish to wait until the morning before you go to Hogwarts. Professor Dumbledore would be far too busy with preparing for the students' arrival to interfere. It will give other beneficiaries little time to arrive, but I will compile a list of who they are and send it to you, Mrs. Dursley. You can let me know if any of them can be warned in advance."</p>
<p>"Good," Aunt Petunia said. "Now, can we go over the funds that were left behind by my sister and her husband? Apparently, there were to be payments, but we never received any of them."</p>
<p>"Never received--!" Mr. Swashlin stared at Aunt Petunia, his glasses flashing and his eyes going white with a brown ring around them. He shook his head and then things got very, very confusing for Harry.</p>
<p>Aunt Petunia and Mr. Swashlin bent their heads over the accounting books that they'd been given, comparing notes between what Mr. Swashlin had and what the goblins had. It was full of talk of timed withdrawals, automatic approvals, lack of signatures and more things that Harry simply couldn't follow.</p>
<p>Harry opened his account book, slowly paging through it for lack of anything else to do. Numbers, numbers, more numbers, all with little notes in precise writing specifying if it was incoming, outgoing, regular, irregular.</p>
<p>'Conquest of Slytherin' sat next to a truly humongous sum.</p>
<p>"What does conquest mean in an accounting sense?" Harry asked during a pause for note-taking on both Aunt Petunia and Mr. Swashlin's sides.</p>
<p>"It's an old concept," Mr. Swashlin said, far more focused on his notes and his anger than on Harry's words. "If one defeated an opponent in battle, then one received their goods in conquest. Why?"</p>
<p>"It says my mum and dad got everything Slytherin because of conquest," Harry said.</p>
<p>He immediately passed the account book over to Mr. Swashlin when Mr. Swashlin's head snapped up to stare at him. Mr. Swashlin read it over four times before he took off his glasses and buried his face in his hands. Harry stared at him. Then turned to Aunt Petunia who just sighed and pursed her lips.</p>
<p>Come to find out, the defeat of Voldemort, last of the Slytherin line that everyone had said was Harry's accomplishment was actually his parents'. The accounting book made that perfectly clear. Mr. Swashlin did some magic that made the entry rise up off the page and expand into a written report that he copied down onto a separate piece of parchment. It ended up being nearly three feet long before the report was fully transcribed.</p>
<p>"Well, that's nice," Harry murmured to Aunt Petunia. "I like that I can learn how to get details of each of the charges. It's like a mini-audit."</p>
<p>"Hmm, good point," Aunt Petunia said. She looked quite pleased at that idea, not that she'd be able to do it herself. "Though I'd assume that people can hide things from the spell given that Silverclaw said that a full audit needed to be done."</p>
<p>Harry nodded. They waited as Mr. Swashlin studied the report. Eventually, he pushed back from his desk and went to make tea for the three of them. More for himself, really, but Harry didn't mind a nice cup of tea after the day he'd had. Aunt Petunia sighed over Harry's insistence on putting in too much sugar and milk but he pretended not to see. Mr. Swashlin's tea was stout and black and bitter. It needed more sugar and milk.</p>
<p>"Your mother was a genius, Mr. Potter," Mr. Swashlin finally said once he had a cup of steaming hot tea in hand. He sipped and winced for how hot it was. "She created an elaborate runic array in your childhood home that created a defense ward once your parents were killed defending you. Your father's magic protected your mother and you until she could activate it. Her magic protected you. I suspect that it still does because the audit says that you carry a shard of You-Know-Who's soul to this day. It's in your scar."</p>
<p>Harry gaped at him.</p>
<p>Aunt Petunia hissed at him so Harry drank his tea, too hot though it was, and set the cup down on Mr. Swashlin's desk. His hand shook just as badly as they had when he ran back home. Maybe worse.</p>
<p>"Can we get it out?" Harry asked.</p>
<p>"I will contact the goblins about it," Mr. Swashlin said. His hands shook a bit, too. "It can be wrapped up in the healing, more than likely. We'll want to see if we can capture it. Such soul shards can be powerful tools to discovering information about their owners. I suspect… I suspect there is much that we need to learn about You-Know-Who, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>"Please," Aunt Petunia said.</p>
<p>Her hands stayed perfectly steady as she drank her tea. And as she continued through the accounting, through figuring out who needed to be there for the will reading, and on to who needed to be told at the Ministry of Magic about Harry's placement and lack of proper supervision from Magical Child Services, whatever that department was actually called. Mr. Swashlin had no idea about the department, which just seemed outright wrong. You'd think it would be something everyone knew about if kids were taken care of properly in the Magical world.</p>
<p>But then, Harry hadn't been. Maybe other kids weren't either.</p>
<p>Mr. Swashlin apparated them to Aunt Petunia's car. That was like being squeezed through a straw. Harry hated it. Aunt Petunia looked positively green when they arrived. But they had the mail boxes, the accounting books and a promise from Mr. Swashlin that he would contact Aunt Petunia tomorrow morning with whatever information he'd managed to uncover over the night.</p>
<p>Harry wasn't sure if Mr. Swashlin intended to sleep tonight.</p>
<p>He wasn't sure if he'd sleep tonight, either.</p>
<p>The drive home was as silent as the drive into London but this time it was more because both Harry and Aunt Petunia were exhausted. She had wrinkles around her eyes and the crease between her eyebrows was a furrow. They stopped and got curry and rice and naan bread for dinner, a big batch of it for them all to eat.</p>
<p>Aunt Marge had yet to arrive. As it turned out, she was supposed to get there the day after tomorrow as she had several commitments to take care of before she could stay for a month. Harry couldn't help but be glad about that. He really couldn't stand her and knew it was mutual.</p>
<p>At bedtime, Dudley hesitated outside the door of Harry's new bedroom, fidgeting nervously.</p>
<p>"It's all changing," Dudley said. Very quietly with a glance towards the stairs but neither Uncle Vernon nor Aunt Petunia appeared to scold them for not going straight to bed as ordered.</p>
<p>"I know," Harry said. He looked at his new owl, sleeping in her cage with her head tucked under her wing, then at the magical trunk he'd set underneath the window. "It's… I think. It was all wrong before, Duds. All messed up. Someone deliberately messed things up for us."</p>
<p>"Mum's fixing it, right?" Dudley said. He slipped inside, carefully easing the door almost shut but not quite so that they'd hear if anyone came up the stairs.</p>
<p>"I think so," Harry said. "I hope so. One way or the other, I'm not going to trust that Dumbledore person. Everything everyone's said so far is that he shouldn't have done any of the things he did and should have done a whole bunch of stuff that he didn't."</p>
<p>Dudley nodded. "Dad's really worried about Anthony Black getting one up on him. He keeps doing stuff that shouldn't be possible. Dad was complaining about it after you and Mum left."</p>
<p>Harry hummed and pulled his bookbag to him. This time when he pulled on the magic of the bag, it gave him the genealogy chart right away. Mr. Swashlin had showed him the little charm that let you expand charts and things like this to see what other information was available.</p>
<p>"Let's see if he's magic," Harry said. He waved Dudley over to the bed even though Dudley on the bed meant there was barely any room for Harry on the bed. "If he is, then Uncle Vernon can get him in trouble for doing magic where he shouldn't. That might help."</p>
<p>Dudley clambered onto the bed with Harry, helping trace through the bloodlines until they found an Anthony Black in the Black family line. With an Anthony as an active wizard, no less. It might even be the same person because his wife was named Lacey just like Uncle Vernon's Anthony Black.</p>
<p>They grinned triumphantly at each other. Aunt Petunia would be delighted to have another weapon against Anthony. Maybe Uncle Vernon would get to keep the vice president position after all.</p>
<p>And maybe, hopefully, tomorrow would bring people who could help Harry learn everything he needed to. There was only a month left before school started. He didn't have much time to get up to speed before going to Hogwarts.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Remus stared at the owl sitting on his windowsill. He'd been out for shopping, getting the few meager groceries he could afford after paying for his wolfsbane for the month. There'd been a scratching at the window before he left. Maybe. He wasn't entirely certain. It'd been years since he'd gotten anything by owl post.</p>
<p>Who was there to send him letters anymore? James and Lily were dead. Harry was safely in hiding, who knew where? Peter, poor Peter, was dead and Padfoot, Sirius, was in prison as he should be. Most of the people he'd known from school were dead, too. There simply wasn't anyone to send him owl post.</p>
<p>Which made the owl sitting on his windowsill entirely unexpected.</p>
<p>"Sorry," Remus said as he took the letter from the owl. "I'm afraid I don't have any treats. Is there a charge?"</p>
<p>The owl gave him a dirty look before flying off without demanding payment. Pre-paid then. That was even rarer. Remus watched the owl until it was out of sight before he actually looked at the letter.</p>
<p>He nearly dropped it.</p>
<p>Gringotts' seal held the envelope shut.</p>
<p>Remus let out a slow breath before delicately opening the envelope. He used the paring knife from his kitchen drawer as he'd sold the one letter opener he had after he lost the job before last. It hadn't been quite enough for his wolfsbane but with the knuts he'd had saved up, he'd scraped by. That month.</p>
<p>Mr. Remus Lupin,</p>
<p>You are hereby informed that the will of Lily and James Potter will be read on August 31st in Gringotts. Present yourself for the reading at 8:00 am sharply.</p>
<p>Silverclaw<br/>Potter Account Manager</p>
<p>He stared. Read it a second time. Turned it over and frowned that there was nothing else there.</p>
<p>"I thought it had been read," Remus mused. "How else was Harry placed?"</p>
<p>His voice triggered a spell that Remus hadn't noticed in his befuddlement. A second message appeared on the bottom of the letter, this one in a deeper blue ink than the silvery-grey ink that Silverclaw had used.</p>
<p>You are invited to meet Mr. Potter prior to the will reading at his guardian's home. If you are interested, please reply to Ms. Petunia Dursley at the attached number.</p>
<p>Remus' legs gave way. He collapsed into the one good kitchen chair he had. Its feet screeched against the floor.</p>
<p>Harry was with Petunia? Why in the world had Dumbledore kept him from seeing Harry? Out of all of them, Remus was the only one that Petunia had tolerated even slightly. Mostly because he'd long since perfected being as unobtrusive and inoffensive as possible, but still, she wouldn't have objected to Remus.</p>
<p>And… If Harry had been placed with Petunia, how was he being trained? What sort of education was he getting? Petunia wouldn't have had any ability to teach Harry about his place in the magical world. She didn't know any of James' history.</p>
<p>"What in the world?" Remus murmured as he held the slip of paper with Petunia's phone number on it.</p>
<p>His heart pounded so hard as he called Petunia that he could barely hear her. The appointment to come over tomorrow afternoon was so mundane, so stunningly polite, that Remus got though it on pure habit. At least until the last bit.</p>
<p>"Do make sure that you look normal," Petunia said just before she hung up. "Our version of normal, please. The neighbors will gossip otherwise."</p>
<p>"Of course," Remus said. "I'll see you tomorrow."</p>
<p>She hung up without saying goodbye. Remus stared at his phone until it beeped at him. Then he hung up and rubbed his face with both hands. Normal. A suit, then. His best suit, not that it was as good as it should be. He'd not had the opportunity to buy a new suit in years. It should do, though.</p>
<p>Harry. He was going to see Harry. After all these years, he would be able to see Harry again.</p>
<p>As hope made his hands shake, Remus' fireplace flared to vivid green light. Remus flinched and automatically hid the letter from the bank under a stack of unpaid bills. Only one person flooed him: Dumbledore.</p>
<p>"Remus, my boy," Dumbledore said with his normal twinkling smile. "I do hope you're doing well."</p>
<p>"As well as can be expected at this time of month, yes," Remus said. "What can I do for you, sir?"</p>
<p>"Why, nothing at all, dear boy," Dumbledore said. His smile looked a bit sharper than it should. Through the floo, Dumbledore always looked more harsh than in person. He just didn't look good in the floo, apparently. "The school year is over so I thought I'd see how you're doing. No issue lately? Nothing strange happening?"</p>
<p>Remus shifted uncomfortably. "No, nothing at all, sir. I'm afraid I can't talk for long. I've got laundry that I need to wash and the landlady reminded me that I'm not to take the facilities for too long."</p>
<p>"Certainly," Dumbledore said even though his smile went a bit sour. There was a smug tone to his voice, though, that made Remus' inner hackles rise. "I'll let you go then. Do let me know if anything out of the ordinary happens, Remus. I can trust you with that, can't I?"</p>
<p>"Of course, sir," Remus said so automatically that he wondered for a second where the impulse came from. But then he had been working to earn Dumbledore's regard for most of his life. It made sense.</p>
<p>"Good, good," Dumbledore said.</p>
<p>He cut off the floo without saying goodbye either. Somehow, Dumbledore's rudeness was more upsetting than Petunia's. Every time he'd met Petunia, she'd been abrupt. Not one for observing the social niceties anymore than Lily had been. Dumbledore? He usually only treated the Hogwarts house elves that way.</p>
<p>Remus frowned as he got up from the fireplace, brushing his knees off. Was that how Dumbledore saw him? Nothing more than a house elf? A tool?</p>
<p>No, he had to be imagining things. The whole shock of the letter from Gringotts and from Petunia had put him off. That was all. He'd go off to see Harry tomorrow. Maybe Harry would even remember Remus, though that was doubtful. Harry had always been closer to Sirius than Remus.</p>
<p>"Well," Remus sighed, "I'd best go get that suit cleaned up. At least I didn't have to lie to Dumbledore. I do need to do laundry."</p>
<p>If only he could keep his hands from shaking long enough to do it properly.</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>Remus Lupin was a very nice man with scars on his face and a habit of holding his mugs of tea in his hands as if they were the only heat he expected to get in any given day. He'd been one of the people who was supposed to be at the will reading. Aunt Petunia, once informed by Mr. Swashlin, had sniffed and nodded approval for him to be informed right away. And she'd said that he was welcome to come visit as long as he did better than his friends James Potter and Sirius Black at looking normal.</p>
<p>He looked very normal indeed when he knocked on the front door. A little shabby, kind of like Harry's old hand-me-downs, with slightly frayed hems on his trousers and a shirt that was a size too big for him, but he'd smiled brightly at Harry and been perfectly polite to both Aunt Petunia and to Uncle Vernon before Uncle Vernon headed off to work, much later than normal because of everything that was going on. Uncle Vernon had taken a half day off, staying right through lunch, just to make sure that Aunt Petunia had everything she needed ready.</p>
<p>There was going to be a dinner party tonight, with Anthony Black and his family. Harry was very, very curious how that would go. Aunt Petunia had all but spit fire when he and Dudley told her about Anthony Black being magic. The party was all her plan because she wanted to know whether or not Uncle Vernon's Anthony Black was the chart's Anthony Black. If so, there would be Consequences For His Behavior.</p>
<p>She's said, very firmly, that Harry was to be quite rude to Anthony Black about never introducing himself properly if he was a wizard, but not in a magical way if he could help it.</p>
<p>He'd kind of thought that she wanted to tell him to do the same to Remus Lupin but no, she'd sighed, explained that Remus was one of his parents very best friends and that he should be as nice as possible to him. So, they'd gone into the back yard with Dudley so that they'd be out of Aunt Petunia's way as she got ready for the dinner party.</p>
<p>"This is lovely, Harry," Remus said as he looked around the garden. His eyes shifted a little bit at times, always towards gold, but not very much at all.</p>
<p>"His eyes go all queer, too," Dudley observed.</p>
<p>"Well, he is magical," Harry said. "That's why he's here. Did Mr. Swashlin tell you anything about why we asked you to visit, sir?"</p>
<p>"Ah, no, only that there was something with Lily and James will?" Remus said. He blinked at the two of them in obvious puzzlement. "And that you were hoping for more information about magical society, but I'd expect you already know a great deal, yes?'</p>
<p>Harry stared at him. Dudley did, too. They exchanged looks and then Harry led Remus over to the bench set against the fence. It was near the cabbages and just far enough away from the blackberry patch that you didn't get scratched but close enough that you could pluck berries from time to time. Especially if the brambles cooperated which they always did for Harry and rarely did for Dudley. They seemed to like Remus just fine because he got three berries without effort, which he shared with both of them.</p>
<p>"Let's sit," Harry said.</p>
<p>"Oh, dear," Remus said. "This doesn't sound good."</p>
<p>"No, it's not," Harry said. "Please promise that you'll stay calm and listen to the whole thing. It's a long story."</p>
<p>"I promise," Remus declared promptly.</p>
<p>Later Harry kind of thought that Remus regretted that promise. Over the course of telling him everything that had happened and all the stuff he didn't know, Remus' eyes went blazingly gold several times. His eyeteeth seemed to get longer twice, and Harry could've sworn that he got claws once, when it was revealed that Sirius was still listed as Harry's second father / godfather on the genealogy chart.</p>
<p>"That shouldn't be possible," Remus protested. </p>
<p>It was the first time he'd interrupted during the whole thing which was pretty good in Harry's opinion. Dudley sat sprawled on the grass, watching them like they were better than any show on TV or even beating someone up.</p>
<p>"Mr. Swashlin said much the same," Harry agreed when he phoned this morning. "Something about a vow and how he couldn't be my godfather or second father or whatever it was if he'd actually betrayed my parents. But then everyone seems to think that I defeated Voldemort when it was clearly Mum and Dad who did it. The accounting book said so."</p>
<p>"That's…" Remus sighed, a forceful huff as his eyes flashed gold. He looked very tired and much older a moment later as the gold faded back to unremarkable brown. "I can easily believe it. Your mother was a genius, Harry. You're so much like her. That hair of yours is all Potter but you, the way you talk and hold yourself, it's so very Lily."</p>
<p>"Always thought it was more like Mum," Dudley commented. He pulled up a handful of grass, scattering it between his sprawled legs with a huge pout that wasn't actually all that bad for Dudley. No screaming, kicking or hitting at all.</p>
<p>"Her, too," Remus agreed. "You're very like your father, Dudley."</p>
<p>"Dad says I'll be a great rugby player when I get older," Dudley said with a grimace. "Rather do other things than that."</p>
<p>"There's always boxing," Harry said because sometimes his mouth had far less sense than even the stupidest of Mrs. Figg's cats.</p>
<p>Dudley grinned at Harry, smacking a fist into his palm so hard that it sounded like mini lightning. Remus started, and then chuckled. He waved for Dudley to stop.</p>
<p>"You'll want to be very careful about that," Remus said. "You're a squib. It seems that your fists allow you to access a touch of magic. That was… not quite a spell but definitely more than just a normal punch. While squibs can't use wands to access their magic, they can express it in various more physical ways. Your fists seem to be a focus for you."</p>
<p>Both Harry and Dudley stared at him. Remus blinked at their shock, taking off his glasses to polish them in a nervous gesture that Harry completely understood. He did it all the time when his glasses weren't damaged. Mr. Swashlin had suggested getting his eyes repaired when the healer came tomorrow so Harry might not have glasses in the future. He wasn't sure if he liked that thought. Sometimes it was nice to have something to fiddle with and hide behind as he worked his thoughts out.</p>
<p>Like Remus did just then.</p>
<p>"Squibs can't use wands or cast spells but they do still have magic," Remus explained to Dudley. "You're a squib, like your mother. Your magic seems to trend towards physical things. Your mother's seems to trend towards understanding people. I think. I'm not sure, actually. I've never spent much time around her before so I could be wrong."</p>
<p>Dudley stared at Remus. Then at Harry who shrugged. It wasn't as if Harry knew anything more about this than Dudley did though if he had to guess he'd say that Aunt Petunia's magic came out in her voice when she was very, very angry.</p>
<p>But apparently being told that his fists were magic was enough to get Dudley over any fear or hatred of magic because he spent the next hour and more pestering Remus with a million questions about how that worked, how squibs could do magic but not and why squibs weren't allowed to be part of magical society when they had magic. Harry was quite curious about that one, too. Sadly, Remus had no good explanation for it.</p>
<p>"Boys!" Aunt Petunia shouted from the back door. "It's time to get cleaned up!"</p>
<p>Dudley groaned. Harry sighed.</p>
<p>"Come on, inside with the both of you," Remus said, chuckling as Dudley collapsed back onto the grass with his arms and legs flung out as if he'd been dramatically stabbed. Rather like some of Aunt Petunia's afternoon shows, really.</p>
<p>Remus just laughed and pulled him to his feet, shooing both of them inside. The house smelled wonderful, like roast beef and mashed potatoes with garlic. Not enough garlic as far as Harry was concerned but no one seemed to like as much garlic as he did. Though, honestly, part of the reason he loved it was because no one else did.</p>
<p>"Oh, that smells amazing," Remus said. He perked up and breathed deeply, one hand over his chest as if he'd never smelled something that good.</p>
<p>"Thank you," Aunt Petunia said in her prim but pleased voice. Her smile was far too tight but that was probably because of everything that was going on. "I expect that you'll be staying. Do something about your suit, please. Boys, I expect you to be clean and dressed in the next half hour. The guests will be arriving soon. Best behavior, understood?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Mum," Dudley said with a depressed sigh. "Do have to smile at them all?"</p>
<p>He winced when Aunt Petunia glowered at him.</p>
<p>"But we know that Black guy is up to something, Mum," Dudley complained. "Why can't I say something?"</p>
<p>"Oh, because I'm supposed to be all stiff and proper and annoyed at him that he's cashing in on knowing me without ever introducing himself," Harry said. "Aunt Petunia explained it earlier when you were playing games."</p>
<p>"Oh," Dudley said with considerably more cheer. "Someone gets to be rude to him?"</p>
<p>Remus stared at the two of them, his eyes glowing gold. "Black, who?"</p>
<p>"His name is Anthony Black, son of Marius Black. We think," Harry said. "His father was Sirius Black's uncle. He was thrown out because he was a squib. But the genealogy chart we have shows that he's actually magical. He works at Uncle Vernon's company and has been trying to keep Uncle Vernon from getting promoted for ages."</p>
<p>Remus stared at Harry with his mouth open for a really long time. "…I think I need to see that genealogy chart, Harry. Can you please show it to me?"</p>
<p>He followed Harry up to the second bedroom that Dudley always claimed as his own. Harry had never liked the room. It was dim and dingy, having only one window that faced north so it had very little natural light. The walls looked like they'd been beaten. A bomb might have gone off in there. Now that he knew that he'd blown the windows out when he was younger, Harry had to believe that he was the one who'd damaged the room, not Dudley when he tossed his broken or unwanted toys inside.</p>
<p>"This is where you live?" Remus asked with a fierce frown.</p>
<p>Harry shrugged. "Sort of. It's complicated. I think I had an accident or something when I was younger. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon never had the money to fix it up afterwards."</p>
<p>"Oh," Remus breathed. His eyebrows went up and then he looked profoundly sad. "I see. Well, give a me moment and I'll fix that."</p>
<p>He pulled out a wand, slender and unadorned other than a little wiggly bit at the base which swelled out into a bulge very much like an onion's bulb. Remus hummed and then whispered something while waving his wand. The walls brightened, lightened. The window went clearer as if the glass was suddenly clean. All the damage to the walls, floors and window frame smoothed out until they looked perfect.</p>
<p>"Wow," Harry breathed. "That's amazing! Can you fix anything?"</p>
<p>Remus grinned at him. "Not anything. I could repair your glasses if you like?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes, please," Harry said. "We'll probably heal my eyes tomorrow but it's annoying having the tape. Especially when I'm supposed to look extra-nice tonight."</p>
<p>Remus waved his want at Harry and there was a wash of warmth over his face. The tape spun off the bridge of his glasses. There was a tiny snap and his glasses suddenly sat perfectly on his face.</p>
<p>"That's brilliant!" Harry exclaimed. "Let me just get that chart for you and I'll go fight Dudley for the bathroom. He takes forever getting cleaned up."</p>
<p>When Harry hurried off to the bathroom, Remus was laughing quietly. He had a very nice smile, quiet and grateful in a way that Harry didn't quite understand. There was certainly something more going on there, but he didn't know what it was.</p>
<p>Not that it mattered when he had to battle with his hair and remind Dudley that he needed to wash both his hands and his face before putting on his clothes. They managed to get cleaned up before Aunt Petunia yelled up at them the third time. </p>
<p>Most of the time Harry wouldn't have to attend dinner parties. He got nervous and uncomfortable around most of Uncle Vernon's coworkers. The bosses and clients that sometimes came over were even worse. They always seemed to be judging everything about the house and the people and especially Harry.</p>
<p>At least now he knew why.</p>
<p>So, he was kind of looking forward to the dinner party tonight. He had Aunt Petunia on his side for once and Remus would be there. And if worst came to worst, maybe Dudley could punch that Anthony Black with his magic fists. It'd be nice to watch someone else get Dudley-punched. Harry had always known that Dudley's blows hurt more than anyone else's though he'd thought it was just that Dudley meant it more than other people when he hit Harry.</p>
<p>"You must have spent a lot on this," Remus commented once Harry came back in his fixed-up bedroom. "The spell work is very robust."</p>
<p>"I guess," Harry said. "I was just determined to have something that would tell me things about Magical society. Hagrid wasn't very happy about me buying it. Mr. Flourish seemed a little surprised that I wanted it, but I did tell him that Aunt Petunia and Aunt Marge are both very serious about genealogy. That was when he said I should get this one. It seemed expensive but then all of genealogy stuff is expensive so not really horribly pricey compared to some of Aunt Marge's genealogy books. I mean, in my opinion, anyway. She's spent hundreds and hundreds of pounds just for one or two thin little books for just tiny bits of information."</p>
<p>"Hm." Remus didn't explain what he found interesting about that. He just frowned thunderously at the chart as he nodded. Remus folded the chart back up. "I'll go borrow the bathroom now. I do better repair work when I can see what I'm working on. I'll be right back."</p>
<p>Harry watched Remus go. Yeah, there was definitely more going on there, but he didn't know what it was. Yet. He'd ask Aunt Petunia tomorrow before the healer and Aunt Marge showed up. At least he didn't have to deal with Aunt Marge at the dinner party. That would have been horrible, no matter what new information he had.</p>
<p>"Harry!" Aunt Petunia shouted.</p>
<p>"Coming!"</p>
<p>He started out of the room and then stopped. The genealogy chart sat on his bed. Harry ran over, stuffed it into his magically huge trouser pocket and then ran downstairs for inspection with Dudley.</p>

  <p>Anthony blew out a breath as he tried to get his shirt buttoned correctly. Third time, all three times wrong. The tug under his breastbone had gotten so much worse lately. The last few days had been exponentially worse than it had been his entire life.</p>
<p>He felt it. All three of his sisters felt it, too. His youngest sister Genevieve had called in the middle of the night to curse at him for not having figured out how to get them all back into the Black family magic. As if Anthony could actually do anything.</p>
<p>It would be so simple if Potter knew anything about magic. He could go to one of the Dursley's highly popular dinner parties, like tonight's, and simply ask Potter to bring them back in or throw them out for good. At this point all of them would take being thrown out if only to make the borderline pain stop.</p>
<p>"Aren't you dressed yet?" Lacey asked from the doorway of their walk-in closet. "Honey, we need to get going if we're going to be on time. You know we need to impress Vernon and Petunia if we're ever to get at Harry."</p>
<p>"I know, I know," Anthony complained. "Just… struggling. It's so hard to focus, Lace."</p>
<p>She sighed and came to do up his buttons for him. She did his tie for him, too, which was good because Anthony knew he'd have made a complete hash of it if he tried. Once she was done, Lacey smoothed her hands over Anthony's chest, calming him despite the tug of the Black family magic distracting him.</p>
<p>"Who are you?" Lacey asked, just as she always did.</p>
<p>Anthony grinned and took her hands to kiss her knuckles. "A complete idiot. Utterly hopeless fool. Total failure at everything, that's me."</p>
<p>"Be serious!" Lacey huffed but she was just on the edge of laughing, too, eyes wrinkling up and grin blooming on her mouth.</p>
<p>"That's my cousin," Anthony replied automatically. "I'm Anthony. But I can give it a try if you want."</p>
<p>The old, old joke, the first pickup line that he'd ever used on her, drew a laugh out of Lacey though it didn't last as long as it should have. Not too surprising. Lacey's family magic was tugging at her, too, as was the Black magic. She handled it better than Anthony did, but then she was way better trained that Anthony could ever dream of being.</p>
<p>Lacey's smile wrinkles turned into a pained frown. Her breath caught for a second before she sucked air in between her teeth, smiling at him so stiffly that it made Anthony's heart lurch. The Black family magic tugged at them both, an angry, frustrated draw pulling them who knew where. Anthony certainly didn't know. If he did, he would do something about it.</p>
<p>"Oh, Love," Anthony murmured as he pulled her into his arms. "I’m sorry. We'll go. We'll be charming. We'll finally get past Petunia's ice queen perfection and make a real connection with them. And, somehow, we'll talk to Harry. He's eleven. He should be learning about magic anytime now."</p>
<p>"I certainly hope so," Lacey grumbled. She hugged him hard enough to make Anthony's ribs creak. "If Dumbledore doesn't decide that he's 'too damaged' by the Killing Curse to pollute his precious little pupils. He might throw Potter away just like he did our ancestors. And us."</p>
<p>That was Anthony's real fear. It could happen so easily. His father had been disowned for being a squib. When it was Anthony's turn to get his Hogwarts letter, instead of an invitation, he'd gotten a sternly polite refusal to allow Anthony to attend because of his family's 'dark history'.</p>
<p>What rot. Dad had been as light as anyone. Not very strong, not able to use a wand, but certainly not a true squib. His magic had been all in his hands. He'd made an incredible craftsman around the edges of the magical world in Britain. Not once had he done anything Dark. No one in Anthony's branch of the family had.</p>
<p>Same for Lacey and her two sisters. All of them had been refused admittance to Hogwarts on the thinnest of excuses. Sometimes Anthony wondered if it was because they'd grown up with too much education, too many real resources, for Dumbledore's comfort. A strong mind wasn't one that he could control, after all.</p>
<p>"If he is refused then we'll find a way to get him what he needs," Anthony declared. He huffed when Lacey just raised an eyebrow at him. "I know, I know. The Statute of Secrecy is an issue. We'll figure a way around it. Somehow. This can't go on."</p>
<p>"Right," Lacey agreed though her tone wasn't convinced and neither was her expression. "Get your shoes on. We're going to be late if we don't hurry. And no, we're not taking your car. That thing's a menace. We'll take my car."</p>
<p>"But my car's impressive!" Anthony called after Lacey as she marched out of their magically expanded walk-in closet.</p>
<p>"It's a rolling mid-life crisis and you're too young for one!" Lacey called back at him. "Move!"</p>
<p>Anthony laughed, grabbed his shoes and moved. If he moved a little slower than he normally would because of the family magic clawing at his soul, well, that didn't matter. All that mattered was impressing Petunia and Vernon enough to be allowed around Harry.</p>
<p>If they could just talk to him, privately, it would make all the difference in the world.</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>Anthony Black was a tall, slender man with black hair, silvery eyes and a ready smile that always felt sort of plastic. At least to Harry. The adults around him didn't seem to see it. His hair wasn't quite as messily curly as Harry's, but it did curl in carefully controlled and sculpted loops around his ears and close to the collar of his very fine blue shirt. He'd taken off his suit coat sometime after dinner and now stood talking brightly with Uncle Vernon by the fireplace. Dudley lurked next to them, listening into their discussion with a strained but proper smile that Aunt Petunia probably wouldn't scold him for later. </p>
<p>"That's definitely a Black. One of our Blacks, that is," Remus murmured to Petunia who hummed while smiling her bright, welcoming smile at Anthony's wife who drifted over to their group as if she was bored out of her mind by Uncle Vernon and Anthony's discussion.</p>
<p>"Do excuse me," Petunia said, patting Remus' elbow. "I need to go bring more drinks in."</p>
<p>"Oh, please, do let me help," Mrs. Lacey Black said from her momentary perch on the sofa.</p>
<p>"Nonsense," Petunia said cheerfully, exactly as she never, ever did unless she was hosting a dinner party. "I won't be but a moment."</p>
<p>She bustled into the kitchen, probably to take a moment to breathe, leaving Harry to stand awkwardly next to Remus as Lacey sighed and smoothed her hands over her thighs as if her simple black dress might have suddenly stopped fitting absolutely perfectly.</p>
<p>"I always feel like I should help," Lacey commented to Remus.</p>
<p>He chuckled. "Petunia prefers to do such things herself. Her kitchen is her domain."</p>
<p>"Well, I can understand that," Lacey said but her smile was still hesitant and nervous. Way more nervous than Harry understood. "I suppose you and Dudley are getting ready for school, Harry?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said. "We are. Dudley's going to Uncle Vernon's old school. They're both very proud about it. I'm going to the school my parents went to. It's up in Scotland."</p>
<p>Her eyes flashed for a second. Only the barest fraction of a second but it was definitely there. Her mouth twisted as if she'd just bitten something sour, which surprised Harry. Remus raised an eyebrow at her response as he rested one hand on Harry's back protectively.</p>
<p>"You never said where you went to school," Remus observed.</p>
<p>Lacey's laugh was as brittle as anything Harry had ever heard out of Aunt Petunia when she was furious at someone. "A French school. You've likely not heard of it. That's where I met Anthony."</p>
<p>"Huh, I wondered if he attended Beauxbatons," Remus observed in a completely mild tone that no one listening would've paid the least attention to, but it made Lacey's jaw drop and her eyes flare really bright. "I thought it might have been Durmstrang but he doesn't have the accent."</p>
<p>"Where's that?" Harry asked.</p>
<p>"Germany," Remus said with a grin for Harry that made him grin right back. That was one of the best things about Remus. He never seemed to mind answering questions, no matter how many he'd already gotten peppered with.</p>
<p>Harry nodded, watching Lacey directly and Anthony from the corner of his eye. Anthony was definitely paying attention to the three of them because as soon as Lacey snapped her mouth shut, cheeks going red with what looked like anger, Anthony said something to Uncle Vernon before ambling to her side.</p>
<p>His eyes skipped over Harry's face as if he was afraid to look Harry in the eyes.</p>
<p>"All right there, love?" Anthony asked.</p>
<p>"I thought you said they didn't know," Lacey hissed at him with a thrum in her voice that was very like Aunt Petunia's thrum when she was furious.</p>
<p>Anthony went very, very pale. He still didn't meet Harry's eyes. For that matter, he no longer looked at Uncle Vernon or Dudley, or even Aunt Petunia who came out with a bright smile and a shiny silver tray with some very pretty looking pink, green and yellow drinks. Dudley looked very interested in them but put his hands behind his back the instant Aunt Petunia's professional smile dimmed slightly.</p>
<p>"Goodness, I hope nothing's wrong," Aunt Petunia said.</p>
<p>"No, Anthony was just surprised that we realize he's magical," Remus said very, very calmly despite the way his eyes flashed gold.</p>
<p>"Ah, I thought you didn't know you were magical," Anthony admitted, barely lifting his eyes to meet Harry's. His eyes were slate grey, barely shimmering at all, and he looked very, very nervous.</p>
<p>"Oh, I didn't know until a few weeks ago," Harry said. "Well. Yesterday, really. We learned all sorts of things no one wanted us to find out yesterday. Including that you're some sort of relative."</p>
<p>Both Anthony and Lacey's jaws dropped open. Aunt Petunia firmly served the drinks to the adults, giving Harry and Dudley each a glass of orange punch, which wasn't half as interesting looking as the multicolored drinks the grownups got. Harry didn't protest that. He knew better.</p>
<p>"How could you not know that?" Anthony whispered without sipping his drink.</p>
<p>Lacey sipped hers. Her eyebrows went up and she elbowed Anthony until he took a sip. Then his eyebrows went up in obvious delight and Remus frowned, sipping. He broke into a delighted grin that made Uncle Vernon chortle proudly.</p>
<p>"That's my Pet," Uncle Vernon declared. "Best drinks in the whole neighborhood."</p>
<p>"How old do we have to be to try that?" Harry asked Aunt Petunia.</p>
<p>"Yeah!" Dudley said, frowning at his orange punch.</p>
<p>"Eighteen at the very least. Probably twenty-five, so don't try it," Aunt Petunia said so forbiddingly that Harry just sighed and sipped his orange punch which really wasn't bad at all, but it wasn't raise your eyebrows and beam in delight good. </p>
<p>"That Dumbledore person ensured that Harry was completely isolated and unsupported," Petunia told Anthony and Lacey. "We don't know his plan but he's definitely up to something."</p>
<p>Lacey scowled at the mention of Dumbledore while Anthony looked almost sick to his stomach. He slugged back the drink and shuddered. Both their eyes flared as magic danced over Anthony's curls, making them shift slightly before settling back down into different configurations than before.</p>
<p>Uncle Vernon backed a step away, shuffling his feet nervously.</p>
<p>"What did he do to you?" Harry asked Anthony.</p>
<p>Who laughed bitterly even though Lacey leaned into his side with a worried frown. "When I turned eleven, I got a letter. One that very politely, very definitively, said that given 'family history' and 'past problems' it would be better if I did not attend Hogwarts. I was firmly invited to seek my education elsewhere."</p>
<p>"What?" Remus gasped. There definitely were claws on his fingers for a second which made both Lacey and Anthony back up a step just like Uncle Vernon had a moment before. "But Hogwarts is supposed to be open to all magicals in Britain!"</p>
<p>Lacey snorted, glaring at Remus. "Don't be foolish. Only the people that Headmaster Dumbledore wants get in. I went to Beauxbations willingly, but my sisters desperately wanted Hogwarts. They were forbidden to go, just like Anthony, because our grandmother had been from a Dark family and got disowned."</p>
<p>Harry frowned. "I thought Dumbledore was supposed to be a leader of the Light side of things. Why would he keep out people who were rejected from the Dark side? Wouldn't they be allies?"</p>
<p>"You're expecting logic," Anthony said. He collapsed back on the sofa, still clutching the glass in his hand. "There is no logic there. I really thought… Ah, well. It doesn't matter, does it?"</p>
<p>"Thought what?" Dudley asked just as Harry was going to.</p>
<p>"He's a Black," Lacey said when Anthony just stared at his glass. "You're the Heir Black, Harry. You're his path back into the Family Magic well."</p>
<p>Harry stared at her for a long moment. He'd seen a mention of something about family magic in one of his books but couldn't for the life of him remember it now. There'd been so much focus on the genealogy and the accounts that he'd had no time to read the way he wanted. Still, he could hear the capital letters Lacey put on 'family magic' so it must be very important.</p>
<p>"What does that mean?" Harry asked Remus because he was the only adult there who answered questions happily.</p>
<p>Remus sucked in a breath and then sighed as he sipped his drink. "Magic is in many ways alive, Harry. It flows through bloodlines. It also flows when you form bonds with people."</p>
<p>"Like marriage?" Dudley asked. He scooted close enough so that he could mock-punch Harry in the shoulder. It didn't hurt, at all, and Harry stared at Dudley who grinned like he'd just found an all-new trick to play on Harry.</p>
<p>"That's one sort, and well done on restraining your magic, Dudley," Remus said. "Friendship, sex, oaths, there's a large variety of ways magic can bind people together. But the well of magic a family shares is stronger than any of the others. The Black family magic and the Potter family magic have always been famous for the strength and depth of it. You're in the very middle of both wells, Harry."</p>
<p>"And my father was ritually disowned," Anthony explained, still staring at his empty glass. "Not his whole bloodline, just him. My sisters and I all feel the pull of the magic but there's no one we can get to who will bring us back in ritually so there's only the pull and no flow of family magic back to us."</p>
<p>Lacey rubbed his shoulder, frowning at him. "It's painful, Harry. Anthony had no idea you were part of the Dursley family when he went to work at Grunnings."</p>
<p>Anthony snorted as he smiled wryly at Vernon. "I didn't want to live in magical society because of their bigotry. And I never knew why I was drawn towards you but then I found out Harry is your nephew, living with you, and realized that my magic was pulling me towards the acting patriarch of the Black family."</p>
<p>Harry groaned as he pulled the genealogy chart out of his pocket. He found the Black line, poked it with his magic and discovered that yes, there were lines to Anthony and his sisters. Dudley leaned on Harry's shoulder, studying it, too.</p>
<p>"So, this thing is telling the truth, then," Harry said. He grumbled. "Well, as far as I'm concerned it's stupid to say that you're not family and that you don't belong when you clearly do. You're a Black and you're Sirius' cousin so you're family. That's all there is to that."</p>
<p>There was a tiny flash of light from the chart and then a huge wave of magic that flowed out of Harry and into Anthony and then Lacey. They both gasped. Dudley caught Harry when his knees gave out on him. He panted, blinking because the chart had changed. The faint dotted lines that led to Anthony's branch of the Black family were now solid and bright gold.</p>
<p>Then Remus was there, kneeling in front of Harry so that he could peer into Harry's eyes.</p>
<p>"Ah, well, that was abrupt," Remus said. "Just breathe, Harry. You'll be fine once the flow stabilizes. Same thing happened when James and Sirius declared each other blood brothers. James' parents, your grandparents, were a bit shocked but your family magic is hungry for connections."</p>
<p>"Desperate," Anthony said from the sofa. He rubbed his chest, staring at Harry with eyes that shimmered mercury and silver. "It's desperate. It wants to find and claim everyone it can, no matter who they are. Any connection at all."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, breathing as Remus directed. He did want connections. Friends and family and mentors and every sort of person around him that he could trust. That he could turn to and know that they'd support him. He'd felt desperately lonely all this time and had to wonder if it was deliberate.</p>
<p>What if Dumbledore had done it on purpose? What if all of this was on purpose?</p>
<p>"Anthony," Harry said and realized that it was an order, not a request, but he didn't really care. "Can you check Uncle Vernon to see if he's been spelled to hate and fear magic to an unreasonable degree? And Aunt Petunia and Dudley, too."</p>
<p>"There are some rather nasty wards on the house," Lacey said as her wand appeared with a flick of her wrist. She looked around the room, pointing at the fireplace. "They center over there. The wards aren't doing much. The family wards underneath them are so strong that they're blunting the nasty wards effect."</p>
<p>Anthony grinned at Aunt Petunia's scowl. "My Lacey is a ward-breaker. She's taken three masteries in curse-breaking, ward-breaking and runic magic."</p>
<p>He cast a spell at Uncle Vernon who paled and stayed in place though he really obviously would've rathered run the other way. Or yell. Uncle Vernon's face did go purple. Anthony glowered at the result that floated in front of him. Lacey snarled and stood, stalking over to Uncle Vernon. Remus sagged, his hands tightening uncomfortably on Harry's shoulders.</p>
<p>"He's been cursed," Anthony said. "The house, too. It must be fixed. It's harmful to all of you but especially dangerous to Dudley and Harry."</p>
<p>Aunt Petunia looked at Vernon who'd gone oatmeal-grey. She slugged back her drink and then set it down with an icy click on the silver platter. Anthony stood. Lacey turned to Aunt Petunia, both of them seeming to notice that she was in charge of everything that happened in the house.</p>
<p>"Do it," Petunia said. "Do it and, if possible, make it so that it's not obvious from the outside that it's been done."</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Saint Mungo's was quiet last thing in the day. It had rained earlier, briefly, so the steps were damp. Amal took a deep breath of the moist air before pushing open the front door. Inside, the air was antiseptic and minty, not damp or cool at all. He much preferred the cool wet outside.</p>
<p>Healer Smethwyck's office was off to the side of the Dai Llewellyn Ward, tucked away behind an unornamented door, a ferocious dragon of a nurse who glared at Amal like he might be getting ready to commit murder and she'd have to stop him, and a second door with fading gold paint lettering the words 'Director of Ward' over slightly brighter letters picking out 'Smethwyck'.</p>
<p>"Your appointment is here, sir," the nurse said as she opened that second, very impressively unimpressive door. She glowered at Amal who nodded slightly to her. It didn't do a bit of good.</p>
<p>"Send him in, Beatrice," Healer Smethwyck replied. "Do bring some tea, would you? I think we could do with it."</p>
<p>"Of course, sir," Nurse Beatrice the Dragon said with a not much less severe smile for Smethwyck. "I'll have the elves bring it in right away."</p>
<p>She waved Amal in, glowering the whole time he sidled past her, and then closed the door with a firm and foreboding click. Amal shivered. That was one woman he was going to do his level best never to annoy. Any worse than he'd already annoyed her by daring to request an appointment with Healer Smethwyck.</p>
<p>"Do sit down, Mr. Swashlin," Healer Smethwyck said far more genially. "You'll have to excuse Beatrice. She's not an evening person."</p>
<p>"Ah, no, apparently not," Amal said.</p>
<p>Where Nurse Beatrice was ferocious, Healer Smethwyck was a gentle, grandfatherly older man with a clean-shaven chin, snowy white hair cut shorter than most of the older generation would ever think of, and faded blue eyes that studied Amal as if he was being laid out for dissection.</p>
<p>Tea popped in, complete with toast, jam and some delicious looking strawberry scones.</p>
<p>"I must admit that I'm rather confused as to why you needed an appointment with me," Healer Smethwyck said as he poured tea, portioned out scones and let Amal smear as much jam as he wanted on his toast. "Your message wasn't very clear."</p>
<p>"There are security reasons for that," Amal said. He took a bite of the toast, gratefully since he'd not managed to eat all day. Too many things to take care of for Harry and Petunia. "My client's guardian has insisted on complete secrecy. There are… some very serious dangers that would threaten both my client and their guardians if it became known that I was making this inquiry."</p>
<p>Healer Smethwyck watched as Amal ate his toast and then demolished his scone. He didn't say a thing until Amal started sipping his tea, a delightful peach black tea.</p>
<p>"I assume that you'll need an Oath of Secrecy, then?" Healer Smethwyck asked.</p>
<p>"Not just that," Amal replied, "but your understanding that you'll receive no specifics until we arrive at my client's home. They cannot come here. It isn't safe for them."</p>
<p>Healer Smethwyck nodded slowly, setting his tea down to frown as severely as Nurse Beatrice. "I do not treat Death Eaters."</p>
<p>"That's exactly why I approached you," Amal said. He chuckled at how Healer Smethwyck reared back, surprised. "Your morals and ethics are above reproach. Your skills are the best available in all of Magical Britain. Due to… several constraints, I can't approach someone outside the country. I'm willing to swear an oath that you will be in no danger, that your patient desperately needs help that they cannot receive any other way, and to pay you whatever fee you deem necessary without specifying it ahead of time."</p>
<p>Healer Smethwyck stared at Amal for a long, long time. A good minute and a half of total silence broken only by the sound of Nurse Beatrice moving outside and the cuckoo clock on the wall slowly ticking away towards the half hour. Eventually, Healer Smethwyck shook his head.</p>
<p>"Let's work on the wording of the oaths," Healer Smethwyck said. "I must admit that I'm curious what would require this sort of skullduggery."</p>
<p>Amal grinned, relieved. One hurdle down to getting Harry what he needed.</p>
<p>"I've taken the liberty of writing up drafts of both," Amal said as he pulled his notes from his pocket. "Let's go over them and see if you need any changes."</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>Mr. Swashlin showed up at six in the morning, on the dot, with a healer in tow. It was much, much, much too early. Lacey's work to break the curses took until well past midnight. The wards that she cast took until two. Both Anthony and Remus cast their own wards and protective spells over the house and all four of them, but Lacey was much more serious about and much scarier about it. By the time she was done, Lacey was soaked with sweat, swaying and exhausted.</p>
<p>Remus outright insisted that she and Anthony spend the night in the guest room. He headed back into London where he had a flat, but he promised to be back that afternoon, hopefully before Aunt Marge showed up at three.</p>
<p>Harry had been buzzing with the magic that Lacey'd cast so he'd barely gotten to sleep before three. Three hours of sleep was very much not enough, especially when faced with a perkily cheerful Mr. Swashlin and a stern old Healer in lime-green robes who frowned at Harry as if disapproving of the way he breathed, much less how tired he was.</p>
<p>"This is Healer Hippocrates Smethwyck. He's head of Saint Mungo's Dai Llewellyn Ward," Mr. Swashlin explained to Aunt Petunia who had tea in hand and Uncle Vernon who was scowling as he ate a breakfast of three eggs, bacon, barely toasted toast and most of the jar of marmalade.</p>
<p>"I'm honored that you requested me, Mr. Potter," Healer Smethwyck said with a little incline of his head.</p>
<p>"Um, thank you for coming," Harry said, falling back on Aunt Petunia's lessons on proper behavior. "I appreciate your help."</p>
<p>"He needs the lot," Mr. Swashlin explained. "He's had no treatment at all since his parents died. There's something wrong with his scar, too. The household records audit shows that he has a fragment of You-Know-Who's soul caught in his scar."</p>
<p>"Hm, I see I am actually needed," Healer Smethwyck said. "Come lie down on the couch, Mr. Potter. The scans will take some time so you might as well be comfortable while I do them."</p>
<p>Where Lacey's magic had been hot with anger and prickly with determination last night, Healer Smethwyck's magic felt cool, dispassionate and distant. Harry was tired enough that he found himself falling asleep almost immediately. Healer Smethwyck nodded that Harry could roll on his side and curl up so that's exactly what he did.</p>
<p>He wasn't sure how much later it was when Dudley poked Harry in the forehead, but he could hear Aunt Petunia and Lacey talking in the kitchen. Healer Smethwyck and Uncle Vernon were nose to nose on the far side of the living room, Mr. Swashlin by them nodding urgently. Harry stared up at Dudley who was scowling at Harry.</p>
<p>"You seen this yet?" Dudley asked as he pushed one of the books Harry'd bought but not yet read into his face. "You're in this but it's really rude."</p>
<p>"Uh, no?" Harry said. </p>
<p>He sat up and shifted over so that Dudley could sit next to him. The weird part of what Lacey had done last night was that he no longer wanted to stay as far away from Dudley as humanly possible. His whole life, he'd been wary of Dudley. There was always punching and bullying, and it just wasn't good to be near him.</p>
<p>The moment Lacey removed the curse on the house and then set to work removing curses from all four of them, Harry had found himself pressed against Dudley's side. And Dudley kept getting close so that he could drape a meaty arm over Harry's shoulders. It was weird, very weird, but something inside of him wiggled like a happy puppy over it. </p>
<p>Family magic? Seemed likely.</p>
<p>Harry started skimming through the book and within moments was spluttering with outrage. The book made his life out to be some sort of magical adventure. Which, you know, he could understand people doing as long as they made it clear that that wasn't his actual life.</p>
<p>But no, these books claimed in the beginning, on the back, and at multiple points through the ridiculous stories that it was Harry's real life and his actual adventures.</p>
<p>"You outta sue," Dudley declared.</p>
<p>"No kidding!" Harry looked up and Anthony was there now, talking with Healer Smethwyck with a grim, determined expression.</p>
<p>He got up and went over to tug at Mr. Swashlin's sleeve. Uncle Vernon ruffled Harry's hair, fondly, much the way he always did to Dudley. It was so startling that Harry stared up at him. They both blushed and then Uncle Vernon cleared his throat, nodding to Mr. Swashlin, so Harry decided to let that go.</p>
<p>"What's wrong, Harry?" Mr. Swashlin asked.</p>
<p>"Can we sue these people?" Harry asked. He pushed the book into Mr. Swashlin's hand. "I'm pretty sure that it's libel or something to make up stories like that about a real person and then make money off them without their permission."</p>
<p>Mr. Swashlin lit up like a Christmas tree. "I'd be delighted to sue them! I've hated these stupid books for years!"</p>
<p>Anthony looked over Mr. Swashlin's shoulder and promptly started spluttering with outrage that drew Aunt Petunia and Lacey out of the kitchen. Aunt Petunia took the book from Mr. Swashlin, skimmed the back and then scowled.</p>
<p>"This is a lawsuit waiting to happen." Aunt Petunia scowled at the book, passing it back to Mr. Swashlin when he put out a hand.</p>
<p>"Yes, it is," Mr. Swashlin said very happily. "If you'll excuse me, now that I have your permission, I'm off to do just that. <br/>Harry opened his mouth to say yes and then paused. "Um, wait until the day I go to school to launch it all, but yes. I don't want anyone to know that we're aware of all of this ahead of time. Especially Dumbledore."</p>
<p>"Perfect," Mr. Swashlin said with a big grin that flashed very white teeth against his dark skin. "That should be just enough time to build cases against these people. I'm off. Do call if you need me, Mrs. Dursley, Mr. Potter. I'm always available to you as your seneschal, so whatever you need, whenever you need it."</p>
<p>He headed out of the house, humming happily enough that Harry laughed under his breath. Mr. Swashlin's departure got things going again on Harry's healing except it turned out that he wasn't the only one who needed it.</p>
<p>Dudley had Obliviation damage, not much but enough that Healer Smethwyck had several nasty portions for him to drink. They'd been bad enough that after the first one Dudley resorted to spoiled brat whining and crying to Aunt Petunia, not that it worked. Uncle Vernon had several things wrong, mostly related to not getting enough exercise and eating too much but that was something that he had to go to his mundane doctor over. Apparently magical healing didn't work particularly well for muggles on the weight management and heart health front unless you needed heart bypass surgery. Uncle Vernon's heart wasn't that bad but give it five or six years and it would be, so he sighed and promised to take better care of himself.</p>
<p>Aunt Petunia had six potions to drink, all of which she took without comment or complaint. She did grimace after each one but that was it. Her pointed look at Dudley and Harry made Dudley flush and Harry sigh.</p>
<p>Harry needed epic amounts of healing.</p>
<p>He had that stupid soul shard and damage from something called a cruciatus curse from when he was a baby, probably at the same time his parents had been killed. His bones were too brittle, and his body didn't process food correctly because of the curses he'd been under. Apparently, Harry should have been several inches taller than he was and a couple inches wider at the shoulder, so Aunt Petunia hadn't been all that wrong about him growing into Dudley's hand-me-downs, other than the whole curse thing.</p>
<p>"It will take all year for you to be on track again, young man," Healer Smethwyck proclaimed once he'd written down a two-foot long list of potions and treatments that Harry would need to endure. "We'll start with the most basic things and progress from there."</p>
<p>"The shard?" Anthony asked. Lacey nodded behind him, grim-faced and determined.</p>
<p>"Normally I would say that the boy needed to be stronger to survive the removal," Healer Smethwyck said with a hang-dog expression that made him look way older, "but his family magic moves in him so powerfully that he risks core fracture if we don't get it out quickly. The first thing is to remove all the blocks placed on him, though. Those are causing more problems than anything else."</p>
<p>"Blocks?" Harry asked at the same time that Dudley did. He groaned when Dudley immediately punched him in the shoulder for the jinx.</p>
<p>"Yes," Healer Smethwyck said. He pulled up a glowing scan of Harry's body and then a second one of Dudley's. "Both of you have blocks placed on your mind and magic. Odd to have such things placed on a squib but you do have two blocks, young Mr. Dursley. One prevents you from learning freely. It simulates a Muggle learning disorder called Attention Deficit Disorder. The second encourages you to overeat dramatically by preventing you from ever feeling full."</p>
<p>"Take those off right now!" Harry ordered and didn't even try to apologize for how shockingly rude it was to order around someone that way.</p>
<p>Healer Smethwyck raised an eyebrow only to lean back as Harry's magic shifted on his skin, twisting in his hair and making his eyes glow in ways that Harry could feel even if he couldn't see it. Aunt Petunia glowered at him, but it didn't do a bit of good. It took Anthony coming to sit next to Harry with one arm around his shoulder for Harry to calm down. Somewhat. Not a lot.</p>
<p>"As I said," Healer Smethwyck said as he worked on taking the blocks off Dudley, "his magic is moving like a storm in him. Any threat to people he considers to be his is going to be dealt with in an extreme fashion."</p>
<p>Dudley sat still for all the spell casting which was a huge improvement over what he would've done before Lacey removed the curses on the house. It took almost five whole minutes to get them off Dudley. By the end of it, Harry was twitching almost as badly as Uncle Vernon who stood by the kitchen door, clenching his fists as if he was going to charge at the first person who threatened Dudley.</p>
<p>Which he might. He was a rugby player, even if he hadn't played in a very long time.</p>
<p>Aunt Petunia stood in front of Uncle Vernon biting her thumbnail as if she wanted to bite it off but wouldn't. She clearly knew Uncle Vernon was reaching his limit because no matter how he shifted, she mirrored him so that he had to go through her to get at anyone.</p>
<p>Anthony's arm around Harry's shoulder was tight enough to make him wheeze at times but Harry didn't protest. He'd already gouged little bloody marks in his palms from forcing himself not to interfere as Healer Smethwyck worked.</p>
<p>Lacey was the only calm one. She watched what Healer Smethwyck did and nodded occasionally as if she approved. At the very end, when Harry was on the verge of screaming and Dudley had gone pasty and pale with sweat darkening his shirt at the armpits and chest, Lacey suddenly grinned and clapped her hands.</p>
<p>"That's done it!" Lacey exclaimed. </p>
<p>"Oh wow," Dudley wheezed as he collapsed back against the cushions. "Wow. That's… wow."</p>
<p>"There you go, young man," Heather Smethwyck said with a satisfied smile. He wasn't even sweaty or breathing hard. "You'll be able to learn normally now. I suspect that you'll find you have all new favorite foods now that you're not endlessly craving whatever you can get your hands on."</p>
<p>Harry sighed and scooted so that he could check Dudley's face. He got one of Dudley's sweaty palms pushing him away, but Dudley grinned so maybe it was all right. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon both rushed over to fuss over Dudley who groaned like they were killing him with all the baby names, fussing and petting he got.</p>
<p>"Will my blocks be like that?" Harry asked Healer Smethwyck.</p>
<p>"No, my poor boy, they will not," Healer Smethwyck said so sadly that Harry bit his lip. "Yours will be much worse. I would normally recommend that you come to Saint Mungo's for treatment, but given everything I have seen here, I can't believe that you would be safe if you did. I am going to insist on a series of very secure wards around you personally and the room that we do this in. The safest place, for you, is the best location."</p>
<p>Harry winced. "Um, well…"</p>
<p>"The one place in the house that always calmed Harry was the cupboard under the stairs," Aunt Petunia said. She said with a scowl at everyone in the room as if daring them to comment on it.</p>
<p>"It does feel… kind of like mine?" Harry said. "I mean, when I was little and didn't know about magic, I resented it but at the same time it was the one place I felt really safe."</p>
<p>"Always wondered why you stayed in there," Dudley muttered. He elbowed Uncle Vernon and gave him such a hard look that Uncle Vernon went purple-red and spluttered.</p>
<p>"Interesting," Healer Smethwyck said. "Young lady, help me check this cupboard."</p>
<p>Lacey went and sat on the floor next to the cupboard as if sitting on the floor in her very nice black dress wasn't a big deal. She pulled open the door and gasped. Healer Smethwyck swayed a little, eyes going wide. Anthony stood and went to stare into it with them.</p>
<p>"The wards are anchored in here," Lacey said as she stuck her head and shoulders into the cupboard as if it wasn't a big deal at all to find a makeshift bed in a place like this. "It's… wow. There's another whole layer of protection spells built into this place. It's like someone came and wrapped every protective spell in the world on it."</p>
<p>"Agreed," Healer Smethwyck said. He rubbed one hand over his chest. "A mother's love. It's filled with a mother's love."</p>
<p>"My mum," Harry whispered.</p>
<p>Aunt Petunia had tears in her eyes. "Just before Lily and James married, Lily came and spent four days here. Every night she was the last one to go to bed. Every morning she had the kettle on for me. She must have done it while we were asleep. We never used the cupboard for anything. It was empty and ignored until Harry crawled into it the day after he was delivered here."</p>
<p>"He wouldn't sleep anywhere else as a baby," Uncle Vernon said, still red-faced but more ashamed than anything else. "It was… easier than fighting him. Things happened when we tried."</p>
<p>Healer Smethwyck nodded once. "Then this will be where you are when we break the blocks and remove the shard, Mr. Potter. It is literally the safest place on the planet for you."</p>
<p>"Though afterwards," Lacey said, wagging a finger in Harry's direction, "I'm going to see if I can encourage the wards to expand out over the whole house. No reason for it not to with you all seeing reason. And it'd be much better for the whole house to have this sort of protection than just one cupboard that you'll be too big for soon."</p>
<p>Harry nodded. He got up and headed to his cupboard, running a hand over the door. One more time. One more time in it, some magic, and he'd be stronger. Smarter. Safer. He could take care of the others. Keep people from getting hurt.</p>
<p>And maybe, if he was really strong and smart, he'd be able to find all the lost members of his family, the Black family, and get them healed and safe, too.</p>
<p>"I'm ready," Harry said as he scooted into his cupboard. "Go ahead."</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>The weirdest of all the weird things that had happened since Harry got The Letter was how little attention Dudley got anymore. Not like it was a bad thing. He'd never really liked all the stupid pet names Mum had or the way Dad treated Dudley like he was the best thing ever. It felt icky and weird and wrong even though a part of him, the part he didn't much like, had accepted it as his due.</p>
<p>That part was completely gone. Another thing in the weird column. Being able to think clearly without hunger distracting him or anger making his thoughts splutter to a stop or the whole thing where no matter what he did, the stuff he read and did at school just never stayed in his head no matter how hard he tried to keep it there--all of that was weirdly awesome.</p>
<p>Being able to stand next to Mum as she cupped her elbow and pursed her lips while nodding gravely to Healer Smethwyck and not be noticed?</p>
<p>Super-duper weirdest of the weird. He'd never known how other kids got away with stuff unnoticed. Dudley got away with stuff, sure, but he did it bold as brass. Never just doing it and not being noticed until way afterwards.</p>
<p>"The spells on him should…" Healer Smethwyck sighed and rubbed his hands together like they ached, around and around and around, circling and pressing on his knuckles. "The damage they did should have been reversed now that the blocks are gone. A few more years, as little as a few months if they were reinforced, and it's very likely he would have had congenital cognitive problems."</p>
<p>"It would have stunted his intelligence?" Mum asked way too calmly for something like that. Anthony was huffing like he was half a second away from pitching a tantrum to beat any that Dudley'd ever thrown.</p>
<p>"Oh, no, much worse," Healer Smethwyck said. His face, already old and grey looking from exhaustion, went even greyer as the wrinkles around his eyes and mouth turned way, way down. "It would have destroyed his capacity for curiosity. Investigation. Joy in the discovery. He would have had the intelligence to learn whatever he chose, certainly, but without someone else to prompt him to do it, he would never have done so. No questions, no wondering why, no learning something for the joy of learning it."</p>
<p>Mum sucked in such a sharp breath that Dudley and Dad both backed off a step automatically. Maybe because they didn't know Mum that well, Lacey and Anthony both stepped towards her. Lacey even dared to put a hand on Mum's elbow even though Mum might just bite her head right off for it.</p>
<p>"My sister was one of the most curious people in the world!" Mum snapped at Healer Smethwyck. Not in the angry voice but in the about to cry one that always made Dad go to pieces.</p>
<p>Predictably, Dad stepped right back in and rugby-blocked Lacey away so that he could pull Mum into his arms. Lacey blinked at him and then her lips twitched with amusement at the way Dad fussed over Mum, patting her back and gently smoothing her hair.</p>
<p>"Pet, it's fixed," Dad said.</p>
<p>"That man," Mum said and wow, she really was upset. There were tears in her eyes. "He's done so much harm but to take Harry's curiosity away from him--!"</p>
<p>"I will write up a full report," Healer Smethwyck told Mum. "With copies of my memories of everything that we've seen and done here. They will go to your seneschal so that he can add them to the case against Dumbledore. I would not have believed that anyone could do such a thing if I hadn't seen it. Hopefully, this will help convince others that it was true and that it did happen."</p>
<p>"That Dumbledore's powerful enough that he might weasel out of it?" Dudley asked before he thought about it.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Healer Smethwyck just nodded to Dudley. "He may very well do exactly that. It wouldn't be the first time, though during the Great War he had… extenuating circumstances to explain everything."</p>
<p>Dudley frowned at that even though all the adults just brushed it off. That Dumbledore guy'd done things before? Bad things? And he'd gotten away with for ages and ages and ages. So much so that now he was after Harry and Dudley's whole family. Not to mention Anthony and Lacey's families, too.</p>
<p>"The shard won't harm anyone will it?" Dad asked. It was the sixth time he'd asked, which seemed like a lot to Dudley, much less everyone else.</p>
<p>Despite having been asked the same thing over and over, Lacey nodded yet again. "I've got the best wards and spells around it. It's sealed in crystal, which is perfect because it's lead crystal. Best thing for this sort of spell. And Anthony and I will be taking it straight to the bank after we're done here."</p>
<p>"Wise," Healer Smethwyck said. "A shard of You Know Who's soul is the last thing that should be left lying around. I trust that the goblins will take care of it."</p>
<p>"Absolutely," Anthony said as if Healer Smethwyck hadn't said it three times before.</p>
<p>He was repeating things just like Dad was. And so was Mum, because she started in on keeping everything a secret again and Lacey complained about Dumbledore again. As Anthony started in on his thanks for being allowed to be part of the family again, Dudley shook his head and slipped away from the grownups.</p>
<p>They could keep going in circles all they wanted. Wouldn't accomplish a single thing. What mattered was that Harry was okay. And that the horrible Dumbledore, making sure he didn't get away with hurting anyone else was important, too.</p>
<p>Dudley slipped upstairs, stepping light so Mum wouldn't hear him and tell him to leave Harry to sleep in peace. Which, you know, he was but it felt better to confirm that himself. A loopy strand of hair'd gotten into Harry's eyes so Dudley carefully brushed it aside. That revealed the scar on his forehead.</p>
<p>"Huh, it's gotten lighter," Dudley whispered. "Not so red. That's good, I guess."</p>
<p>He made sure that Harry was tucked in right and then went out in the back yard. Remus'd said that his fists were a focus for Dudley's magic. Dad always said that if you practiced, you got better at it. That meant that Dudley needed to practice using his magic with his fists, both using less of it and using all of it in one rugby-tackle-rush of a blast that'd knock even that Dumbledore off his feet.</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>Harry woke in his bed in the smallest bedroom upstairs. His whole body ached. It felt like he'd gotten the worst beating possible after a bout of Harry Hunting. He opened his eyes and nearly jerked himself upright.</p>
<p>He could see the ceiling. Clearly. There was a spider slowly crafting a web over his head and a fly had already been caught in its web.</p>
<p>His bedroom door was open. Harry could hear people talking downstairs. His bedroom was clean and tidy, all of Dudley's broken toys removed.</p>
<p>Hedwig, Harry's owl, flew over and perched on the bedframe. She hopped down and started grooming Harry's hair. He got the distinct impression that she'd been very worried about him.</p>
<p>"Hey girl," Harry said. </p>
<p>His voice came out all hoarse, but Hedwig didn't seem to care. Harry caressed her feathers, scratching under her beak and behind her ears, making her close her eyes and lean into his touch. He smiled, feeling better just having her there.</p>
<p>"You're awake!" Dudley exclaimed from the door. "Mum, Dad! Harry's awake!"</p>
<p>"How long was I out?" Harry asked.</p>
<p>"About four hours," Dudley said as he came in and sat on the foot of Harry's bed. "Anthony and Lacey have gone home. Remus is here. He's plotting with Mum and Dad how to explain it all to Aunt Marge. She should be here any minute. You screamed and screamed and then the shard thingie screamed but Lacey caught it in a crystal vase Mum had and sealed it up. She and Anthony are hunting for books and stuff because there's something off about it. Lacey said something about pieces missing and wandering souls, but I didn't understand that. I tried reading my maths book and I understood it, Harry! I actually got it on the first go-through."</p>
<p>Harry grinned as he slowly eased upright. "That's wonderful. You've always struggled with maths."</p>
<p>"Not anymore," Dudley said as he puffed his chest out in pride. "I'm gonna be better at it that Dad is."</p>
<p>"That's my boy," Uncle Vernon said with just as much pride form the doorway. "Hope you're up to this, Harry. Marge just drove up and she's in a strop. I can tell already."</p>
<p>"Tell her I have a bit of flu," Harry suggested. "I'll come down and show her the mundane side of the genealogy chart. She should only be able to see that one, but it should be enough."</p>
<p>"Vernon!" Aunt Marge shouted from the front door. "I'm here! Where's my favorite boy? Oh, good afternoon, Petunia. And who's this?"</p>
<p>Both Dudley and Uncle Vernon fled down the stairs like a herd of thundering elephants in their haste. Harry snorted a laugh when Aunt Petunia snapped at them for it. He nuzzled Hedwig and then pulled on his new robe before slowly shuffling downstairs. Honestly, he felt like he had the flu. He was so tired and so sore and just wanted to sleep but this side of things needed to be addressed, too.</p>
<p>"What in the world could that boy need a tutor for?" Aunt Marge snapped as Harry shuffled down the stairs.</p>
<p>"It's in here," Harry said. He sighed as Aunt Petunia scowled and headed into the kitchen to make him tea. Hopefully with lots of honey. His throat could use it. "I was invited to go to my father's old school and found a genealogy chart that showed who he really was. My mum never told Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon."</p>
<p>Harry opened the chart to the muggle side, smoothed it out and showed Aunt Marge the entry for the Potter family. Which very clearly showed James Fleamont Potter marrying Lily Evans and producing one Harry James Potter. Him.</p>
<p>It took less than a second for Aunt Marge to trace back up the chart to the royal family, back around the War of the Roses. She gasped and clasped both hands to her very ample chest before staggering backwards as if about to pass out. Uncle Vernon caught her and guided her to the armchair while Dudley caught Ripper who was, strangely, behaving very, very well while staring right at Remus.</p>
<p>"How could she not say?" Aunt Marge gasped to Aunt Petunia when she emerged from the kitchen with a cup of honey tea for Harry and a small brandy for Aunt Marge. "All these years and you've not raised him at all right. Your promotions, Vernon! No wonder they were delayed!"</p>
<p>"I don't know," Aunt Petunia said with the Sniff of Doom. "But she did and now we've to deal with it all. Remus Lupin is an old friend of James and Lily. He knows everything that Harry needs to learn. Dudley and Vernon, on the other hand, need different training. That's why we asked you to come and stay until the school year starts."</p>
<p>"You only have to ask," Aunt Marge declared. She threw back the brandy and shoved herself to her feet. "We'll get started right away. You," she wagged a finger at Remus who just raised an eyebrow at her, "tell me if you need any resources. I've got all the books on royalty, nobility and the upper class. The lot."</p>
<p>"Oh, that will be helpful later," Remus said quite mildly. "It's bit early for that, given Harry's condition. I'll certainly come to you if I have any gaps in my material. I'll just see Harry back up to bed. Wouldn't do for him to get worse, you know."</p>
<p>He leveled a serious look at Ripper who whined and settled down next to the fireplace without a single complaint, growl or attempt to snap at Harry. If that was magic, Harry wanted to learn it. Right away. Ripper never behaved that well for him.</p>
<p>"I can't stay the whole month," Aunt Marge said as Harry and Remus went upstairs, "but I can give you at least this week and part of next. We'll just have to work hard at it. Good thing that it's summer and a weekend. We'll get you up to snuff right away, Vernon. I'm sure my Dudley will learn it like that!"</p>
<p>"Yes, I will," Dudley declared so proudly that Uncle Vernon puffed up like a pigeon and Aunt Marge cooed at him while hugging him far too tightly.</p>
<p>Harry grinned at Dudley's squirming as he let Remus push him into his bedroom. The tea did help his throat quite a lot. He was still very glad to settle into bed, though. It was still strange to have a proper bedroom.</p>
<p>Stranger, though, was that the bedroom now felt like his cupboard.</p>
<p>"She did widen the wards Mum left," Harry said once he'd finished his tea.</p>
<p>Remus, who'd sat quietly at the foot of Harry's bed as he drank the tea, nodded and smiled sadly. "It didn't take much. Lacey was of the opinion that they should have widened naturally once you arrived. The curses must have affected Lily's wards, keeping them from doing what they naturally should."</p>
<p>He took the mug from Harry, cleaning it with a quick swirl of his wand that Harry made a mental note to learn before he got to Hogwarts. Cleaning with just a wave of his wand sounded like a lovely thing. Harry started, pushing back the covers despite Remus' little noise of objection.</p>
<p>Harry's wand was sitting in his trunk, resting on top of his new robes. With everything that had happened, he expected that the wand would feel better in his hand but when he picked it up, the wand felt prickly and unhappy to Harry.</p>
<p>Remus took the wand and frowned. "What's wrong with your wand?"</p>
<p>"When I went to Ollivander's," Harry explained as he gratefully climbed back into bed, "Mr. Ollivander had a hard time finding a match for me. This is the brother wand to Voldemort's wand. They share a core from a phoenix, two feathers taken on the same day. At the time, something inside of me didn't want it, even if the wand was the one that worked best for me. Now, the wand feels prickly, like it doesn't want me to use it."</p>
<p>Remus dropped the wand on the bed, rubbing his hands over his thighs in disgust. He stared at the wand like it might transform into a snake and bite him. Not that Harry would let a snake bite Remus. He'd tell the snake that Remus was a friend first.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, could you transform something into a snake? That might be useful. And scary. He'd have to read up on it later when he could keep his head up.</p>
<p>"Well, you can't get rid of it," Remus said but he grimaced as if he really, really wanted to. "It could be used against You-Know-Who, though it wouldn't work as well as an unrelated wand. We'll have to get you a different wand somehow."</p>
<p>"I'd prefer it," Harry agreed. He yawned widely. "That one doesn't feel right anymore. But I wondered. What happened to my parent's wands? Are they still around or did Voldemort break them?"</p>
<p>"Ah, they were probably magically taken to the Potter vaults," Remus said sadly. "I don't remember anyone seeing them at your parent's house. There's more than likely quite a few wands there. We can take some time to check at the bank after you've recovered."</p>
<p>"Why am I so tired?" Harry asked, wiggling downwards until the was completely covered and his head was on the pillows again. "I just want to sleep."</p>
<p>"Removing the blocks and the shard magically exhausted you," Remus explained as he smoothed the covers over Harry. "It was… very strenuous even with Lily's wards protecting you. Healer Smethwyck had to repair quite a few fractured bones in your hands. You dislocated your shoulder struggling against the spells towards the end. And, honestly, that space was far too small. You hit the walls multiple times thrashing. It's all been healed other than your aches and pains and the drain on your magic. You should be much better tomorrow. Monday we'll go to the bank together. I suspect that your aunts will be very busy with Dudley."</p>
<p>Remus' smile was quietly mischievous. Harry laughed and yawned and then waved towards Hedwig who flitted over to go back to grooming his hair. He smiled and let her, not that he could have stopped her with his eyes drooping shut.</p>
<p>"Make sure she eats?" Harry asked Remus.</p>
<p>"I'll spell the window so that she can enter and leave at will," Remus promised. "She'll be more likely to hunt this evening than now. Rest. We'll get started on the tutoring tomorrow with an in-depth history lesson. You'll need it for context."</p>
<p>Harry smiled. Just what he wanted. He needed to know about the magical world if he was going to live in it. He couldn't imagine why Hagrid had been so resistant to his getting history books. It was just logical that Harry learn that sort of thing.</p>
<p>As he fell asleep, Harry realized that Dumbledore might have wanted him completely ignorant. Powerless, weak, confused, abused and frightened, Harry would've been happy for anything given to him. Already he knew he wasn't going to do what Dumbledore wanted, no matter what it was. He'd have to be careful and make sure that he had as many allies and scattered distant relatives on his side as possible before school started. It was the only way to be safe.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Remus gathered together ten books that Harry needed to read, three that Petunia had requested, eighteen for Dudley and shrank them down so that they'd fit in his pocket. There was so much that Harry needed to know. But knowing what they'd gone through, Petunia and Dudley needed nearly as much information. </p>
<p>He wasn't at all sure what to do for Vernon. The man gave every indication that he'd refuse to believe that he was struggling, but he clearly was. There just wasn't much that Remus could do for Vernon given that he was a Muggle.</p>
<p>Once the books were secure, Remus patted his pockets absentmindedly as he scanned for his keys. The apartment had wards. He'd put them in himself when he rented it, designed specifically to make sure that everyone would be safe when he had his little wolfy problem.</p>
<p>The fireplace flared green.</p>
<p>Remus froze, staring at it. Dumbledore. It had to be Dumbledore. Damn it.</p>
<p>"Remus, my dear boy," Dumbledore said with a smug smile as soon as Remus knelt down and put his head into the flames. "I was hoping you had a couple of minutes. I had something that I needed to consult with you on."</p>
<p>There was no reason for him to say no. None that Remus could think of that would work, at any rate. Remus nodded and smiled.</p>
<p>"Of course, sir," Remus said. "Go ahead and come through. I do have some errands to run so I can't spend long with you, but I'd be glad to give you my opinion if you think it's worthwhile."</p>
<p>"Your opinions are always worthwhile, Remus," Dumbledore said.</p>
<p>Remus pulled back and sucked in a breath so that he could work on controlling his expression. The last thing he wanted to do was betray just how much he disbelieved that little lie. Dumbledore had never valued his opinions about anything, only his capacity to go places that no one else could and survive them when anyone else would have died immediately.</p>
<p>Of course, Dumbledore didn't come straight through as Remus expected. Anyone else would have, but no, Dumbledore had to make Remus wait on him. Always.</p>
<p>Eventually, ten minutes later, Dumbledore erupted from the fireplace. Ash swept off him and back into the fire with a flick of his pale wand. His scent was annoyed, not as annoyed as Remus had ever smelled, but distinct enough that Remus slouched his shoulders and rubbed his hands together in the way that always made him seem the most harmless.</p>
<p>Dumbledore's smile was gentle, grandfatherly, and utterly at odds with the sharp ferocity of his scent.</p>
<p>"Thank you for your time today, my dear boy," Dumbledore said. "What I need is fairly minor."</p>
<p>"Well, whatever I can do, sir," Remus said, blinking several times as Dumbledore's eyes twinkled more strongly at him.</p>
<p>The scent of ferocity fell off, replaced with an earnestly concerned scent, a worried scent. Remus relaxed a little. Whatever it was much have upset Professor Dumbledore before he came though the Floo.</p>
<p>"There have been some… questions about Harry, you see," Professor Dumbledore said. He looked so sad that Remus frowned. "Concerns about where he is, how he'll handle being returned to our world. I was wondering if anyone approached you for information about him?"</p>
<p>"No," Remus said, completely honestly. "Not at all. I must admit that I have wondered how he's doing, but you know that. I've asked about seeing him often enough."</p>
<p>"I know, I know, my dear boy," Professor Dumbledore said. </p>
<p>He stepped closer and put his hand on Remus' elbow. His eyes sparkled so much that Remus couldn't see the color of his eyes. It was hypnotic, pulling his eyes towards Headmaster Dumbledore's and holding them there. Remus vaguely noticed that Headmaster Dumbledore still had his wand in his hand, moving in slow circles that almost looked like a spell being cast, but Headmaster Dumbledore would never do that to Remus.</p>
<p>"The other issue is rather more serious," Headmaster Dumbledore said. "I've had several questions about Sirius. There are people attempting to get him out of Azkaban, which is ridiculous. It's political suicide and quite dangerous to Harry."</p>
<p>"On what grounds?" Remus asked, heart beating faster. He managed to tear his eyes away from Headmaster Dumbledore's. The wand stopped moving instantly.</p>
<p>"They claim," Headmaster Dumbledore said with a rising scent of annoyance, "that he didn't have a trial. Ridiculous. They want to rush out and risk Harry's safety by letting Sirius out. It's a problem that I hope you'll help with, Remus."</p>
<p>Remus nodded, licking his lips and looking at Headmaster Dumbledore's pursed lips rather than those dangerous, seductive eyes.</p>
<p>"I will do whatever I can, of course, sir," Remus replied. "Though I don't know what I could do. I mostly live in the muggle world now."</p>
<p>Headmaster Dumbledore smiled.</p>
<p>"Thank you so much for letting me ramble, my dear boy," Headmaster Dumbledore said.</p>
<p>Remus blinked, shook his head and nodded even though he had absolutely no clue what Headmaster Dumbledore might have said. "I'm always glad to listen, sir. Is there anything else I can do for you? I do need to run those errands but I can make time for you, if necessary."</p>
<p>"No, no, there's no need for that," Headmaster Dumbledore said. His smile was especially bright and happy as he tucked his wand away. "You go on your way. I'll just be going. Many things to do with school starting up soon."</p>
<p>"Of course," Remus agreed.</p>
<p>He waited until Headmaster Dumbledore left and then frowned. Odd that the flat smelled like pain and fear. He'd just been listening to Headmaster Dumbledore about the foolish efforts to get Sirius out of Azkaban. Really, he couldn't imagine why anyone would do that.</p>
<p>Well.</p>
<p>Remus frowned.</p>
<p>Yes, he could. Sirius was innocent. He still had the godfather bond to Harry. Really, he shouldn't be in Azkaban at all.</p>
<p>But then, Headmaster Dumbledore was right that getting him out now would be a threat to Harry. Harry needed to be safe.</p>
<p>"Speaking of which, I do need to get going or I'll be late for Harry's tutoring lesson," Remus shook his head at himself.</p>
<p>Then shook his head harder because it felt like his head was full of wool, sticky bits of it that clogged up his thoughts. He growled, rubbing his forehead. A headache so suddenly wasn't good. Maybe he should lie down?</p>
<p>His wolf growled inside of Remus at the thought of not seeing Harry and Dudley.</p>
<p>No. He would go. He would suggest walking because walking outside always cleared his thoughts. He'd do his best to teach Harry what he needed even with this damnable headache out of nowhere. Really, it was so odd how many headaches he got after talking to Professor Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Stress. It had to be stress. From the very first day that he'd spoken to Dumbledore, he'd been stressed whenever he was around the man. His wolf had never been fond of Dumbledore, which always made Remus struggle to continue to be polite to the man rather than snarling as he wished to.</p>
<p>Not that it mattered now that Dumbledore was gone. He had lessons with Harry to enjoy.</p>
<p>Remus nodded and carefully locked his door as he left. Wouldn't do to let anyone get into his flat. Who knew what sort of mess they might make?</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>"Good morning, your Grace," Aunt Marge said when Harry came down for breakfast the next day.</p>
<p>He stared at her for a long moment before warily going to the fridge for milk. "That's so strange."</p>
<p>"You'd best get used to it, your Grace," Aunt Marge declared. "Your position is, sadly, mostly ceremonial at this age but eventually you'll have a good bit of power in society once you grow up. A proper seat in the House of Lords. I can't imagine why your mother never mentioned it."</p>
<p>"From what Remus said," Harry said as he filled a mug halfway with milk and then added tea and sugar on top of it even though it made both Aunt Petunia and Aunt Marge grimace, "my grandparents died a few months before my dad did. He had an uncle who was the duke, but he was killed in an accident. A fire. And my dad was the duke for only a few weeks before he and my mum were killed. They might not have had the time."</p>
<p>Aunt Marge huffed as if that was a very poor excuse. In her mind, it probably was. Her entire life revolved around bloodlines and breeding, both human and canine. Oddly, Ripper was sitting perfectly calmly at Aunt Marge's side without making any attempts to snap at Harry.</p>
<p>"Um, just a thought," Harry said as he stared at Ripper who stared back with beady little eyes that showed no spark of interest in biting, "but, um. Ripper. Since you're Uncle Vernon's sister, and he's got the care of me, does that mean that Ripper's bloodline is more important now? And his training? Won't people be, you know, concerned about his behavior and what it shows about him?"</p>
<p>It was cheating. Harry knew it was cheating. But Dudley looked at Harry with awe as if it was the best idea he'd ever heard of. Aunt Marge gasped and spun in her chair to stare down at Ripper who yipped and stared up at her in shock for her behavior.</p>
<p>Aunt Petunia pressed her fingers against her lips as if she was trying not to laugh.</p>
<p>"You're absolutely right," Aunt Marge declared. "I'm going to call my kennel club. We'll have to do more training for him. Update all the files on him. Goodness, I just don't know how we're going to handle all of this."</p>
<p>"We've already discussed it, Marge," Aunt Petunia said. "We cover what Dudley needs to know before he goes off to school. Remus will handle Harry's tutoring. Then, once Dudley and Harry are away, we'll work with Vernon."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, you're right," Aunt Marge said, shaking her head. She shifted back around like an earthquake made flesh, skewering Harry with a glare at his mug of tea-adulterated milk. "We do need to discuss your tea, though."</p>
<p>"It soothes my throat," Harry said with a little shrug. "I'll have some honey tea later, after breakfast, but this is good for now."</p>
<p>Both Aunt Marge and Aunt Petunia sighed over that which made Dudley grin and snicker into his mug of proper tea. Breakfast was a noisy meal. Aunt Marge lectured as much as she ate, going into the history of the British aristocracy and how the norms of behavior for lords and ladies had developed.</p>
<p>It was fascinating despite Aunt Marge. Harry wished he had a pad of paper to take notes on. Then, two minutes into her dissertation on the War of the Roses and how it affected the social climate of the islands, Harry got up and got a pad of paper and a pen. Dudley waved for one, too, which just made Aunt Marge's lecture go on that much longer.</p>
<p>They were on their third mug of tea when Remus arrived. Harry'd filled six pages with questions he needed to research. Dudley had eighteen scrawled pages of notes that he shuffled between, making stars next to things that were important. Or maybe needed follow up on? Harry didn't ask.</p>
<p>"I see you've gotten into history," Remus said mildly to Aunt Marge.</p>
<p>"War of the Roses," Aunt Marge declared. "Terribly important."</p>
<p>"Quite true," Remus agreed which made Harry stare at him. "I have several books on it that you'll want to read, Harry. They're smaller ones, covering side issues, but your family figures in them so I suspect you'll find them quite interesting. Wash up and we'll get started. I thought, if you're up to it, we might go for a walk. I tend to teach better when I'm moving."</p>
<p>And it would get both of them out of the house. Harry jumped to his feet, snatched up his notes and ran up the stairs as Dudley complained about having to stay inside when Harry got to go out. He just heard Aunt Marge declare that it was no problem at all because she could lecture just as well while walking Ripper and working on his obedience training as while sitting in the kitchen. Poor Dudley. Getting to school as going to be a relief.</p>
<p>As eager as Harry was to get away from Aunt Marge, his body still ached by the time they made their slow, meandering way to the local park. There were kids running around but none of them seemed to notice Harry and Remus. It was as if they weren't quite there. No one ran into them, but they all avoided the park bench that Remus settled on, Harry at his side.</p>
<p>"You did something," Harry commented as he watched Aunt Marge stride by with Dudley and Ripper in tow. Neither of them seemed to see Remus and Harry. Ripper did. He stopped pulling against the leash and waddled at Aunt Marge's side like he'd been properly trained. "And you did something to Ripper, didn't you?"</p>
<p>Remus laughed. "I… have a way with canines. It's a bit of a story. Maybe another time. I've been doing some checking, along with Anthony and Lacey. It's going to upset you. And I'm fairly certain that Petunia is going to want to tear people to shreds."</p>
<p>"What?" Harry asked warily. </p>
<p>Remus looked sad but there was a continuous golden glow to his eyes that made Harry nervous. It wasn't bright like his or Anthony's or Lacey's, but it was definitely not a happy-looking glow. To Harry, it seemed like an angry glow, the sort of anger that burned inside of you until a gust took it off and you blew up in a rage.</p>
<p>"We checked for Sirius' trial," Remus explained. He stared pointedly at the sky, just over the rooftops of the rowhouses on the other side of the park. "He didn't have one. There is no evidence whatsoever that Sirius was ever questioned, much less tried in court for betraying your parents. More importantly, the bank confirmed that Sirius is still your godfather."</p>
<p>"That matters?" Harry asked, more than a little outraged that someone could just be thrown in jail without a trial in the magical world. How was he supposed to trust that he'd be safe if that could happen?</p>
<p>"Yes," Remus said. His eyes flicked to Harry for a second, then locked back on the sky as if he was scanning for planes coming in or helicopters or something. Or maybe brooms. "You see, Sirius took a magical oath to be your godfather. It isn't always done but Sirius was from a very traditional family. The Blacks always took such things very seriously and it was one thing that Sirius kept when he ran away from home. He swore on his life and his magic to protect you. If he'd betrayed that oath, if he'd betrayed Lily and James and you, he'd be dead."</p>
<p>"And he's not," Harry breathed. "So he didn't betray them. Me. Us. Right?"</p>
<p>"Right," Remus agreed. "Anthony is… working to contact some of the other Black family members. He's officially a member of the family now. You gave him that. He's using what power and influence he can to see if he can get Sirius out."</p>
<p>Harry jumped to his feet. "Can we talk to the goblins? Right now? I want to make sure that they know that they should support Anthony in that. No one deserves to be imprisoned like that!"</p>
<p>Remus didn't get up immediately. He leaned forward, elbows on his knees, as he studied Harry. There was something in that gaze that the little voice in the back of his head didn't like. Not so much in a wary, frightened way, but in a 'this isn't right' way.</p>
<p>It felt a lot like that math's teacher, actually. She'd been very curious, very attentive to Harry and then she'd been strange one day. The next she'd been gone but everyone had talked about it. She'd gone weird, not reacting at all like herself. Harry hadn't seen it, but this felt like much the same thing. Remus didn't seem quite like Remus as he stared at Harry as if they barely knew each other. His voice, when he finally spoke, was distant, formal, strange.</p>
<p>"We could," Remus said slowly, finally, after far too long of a pause. "But you should probably let the adults take care of it."</p>
<p>"Oh, I am," Harry said. He waved one hand, gesturing for Remus to come on already. "I just want to let the goblins know that this is an issue. They're still doing the full audit of the Black accounts. If the head of the Black family was unjustly imprisoned, they need to know that. It's important to the audit."</p>
<p>There was a spark around Remus that shifted his eyes from gold to a kind of silvery twinkling effect that Harry had never seen before. It was like Remus' eyes were suddenly hidden behind a curtain of silvery glitter. It was so very strange that he reached out and touched Remus' cheek right where the scars were. </p>
<p>Remus froze, eyes going wide. His eyes went back to their normal brown-gold.</p>
<p>"Your eyes changed," Harry said. "They're always gold. Just gold, even when they get all glowy with your magic. Just now they went all shimmery silver. Like twinkling stars. Are you all right?"</p>
<p>Remus paled so dramatically that Harry pulled his hand back. This time Remus stood but it was like his legs were shaking so hard that he couldn't quite stay upright because he plopped back down on the bench, breathing hard.</p>
<p>"We do need the goblins," Remus said. The words came out hoarse and raw, with a growl to them that matched the fierce gold glow in his eyes. "Right now. But we should tell your Aunt where we're going."</p>
<p>"Stay put," Harry told Remus.</p>
<p>He whirled and ran up the park towards Aunt Marge and Dudley. They could tell Aunt Petunia just as easily as Harry and Remus could. It would save time and running around if they did it instead. Aunt Marge frowned when Harry ran up. Dudley looked desperate for a break.</p>
<p>"Hey, Dudley?" Harry asked, not meeting Aunt Marge's eyes. "I'm really sorry but we just got a message that we have to deal with some stuff for my, you know, seat in London. Can you let Aunt Petunia know that we'll be back later? Probably by supper but I'm not sure. It's banking stuff so it might take a while."</p>
<p>"Sure!" Dudley exclaimed. "I'll go tell Mum right now."</p>
<p>"You shouldn't run about that way, young man. It's not proper," Aunt Marge declared but she nodded to Dudley to run off, which he did like a shot. "It's urgent?"</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am," Harry said. "Remus was very upset about it. It's a problem with inheritance and criminal proceedings that, well, there wasn't a trial and someone's in jail despite it."</p>
<p>Aunt Marge stared at him, mouth dropped open. She snapped her mouth shut and then strode up the path like a warship getting ready to bomb a port. Harry hurried at her side. Thankfully, Remus was visible as she came striding up. He stood, looking a little alarmed by her approach which, really, Harry couldn't blame him. Aunt Marge on the warpath was terrifying.</p>
<p>"What is this about someone in jail?" Aunt Marge demanded.</p>
<p>Remus' eyes flicked to Harry before he sighed. "Harry's godfather is Sirius Black. We just learned that he was imprisoned without a trial after Harry's parents were killed. We need to go make sure that we… give depositions. Well, I do."</p>
<p>"I need to make sure that the bank knows because they're in the middle of a full-blown audit of all the Black accounts," Harry declared fiercely enough that Aunt Marge turned to focus her outrage on him. "Someone locked him up for a reason, Aunt Marge. I bet it has to do with money and power. The Black family has a lot of power and a bunch of them have died under suspicious circumstances before and after he was jailed. It's like one of Aunt Petunia's afternoon mystery dramas except for real."</p>
<p>Aunt Marge nodded, somehow puffing up even more in her fury. "I'll inform Petunia immediately. Off you go, you two. We can't allow such things to happen, especially to the aristocracy. What is the world coming to?"</p>
<p>She stormed off, stomping her way up the sidewalk towards Privet Drive, Ripper happily running along at her side. Remus shook his head and then laughed quietly.</p>
<p>"I didn't expect that," Remus said. "She's very invested in your position."</p>
<p>Harry shrugged. "Aunt Marge's hobby is British aristocracy. And, well, her family is all lesser nobility. Yeomanry. It's a very big deal to her. So, can we go now? Maybe while we're at the bank I can check for a different wand. I really want one that doesn't feel like the brother wand Ollivander gave me."</p>
<p>"Good plan," Remus said. "Let's head off this way where it's less public. I'll apparate us to Diagon Alley and we'll head into the bank first thing."</p>
<p>Harry groaned about the apparition. That really felt weird, but it was much, much faster than taking the train or a car so he couldn't complain too much. At least he could get the goblins working on Sirius' imprisonment and maybe they could suggest something to help Remus with whatever was wrong with him.</p>

  <p>Anthony ran his fingers through his hair, tugging at the curls as he grimaced. Silverclaw was going to glare. And sneer. He'd get that look as though Anthony was the worst excuse of a wizard that he'd ever seen, and lift one lip so that his teeth showed in a display that was all scorn, no threat.</p>
<p>Because who'd find Anthony threatening when he couldn't do one simple little thing?</p>
<p>All he needed to do was figure out what Sirius' case number was. It was so straight-forward. Anthony had reassured Lacey that it would be the work of five minutes. He'd slip into the Ministry, go to the records department, locate Sirius' file, and get the case number. </p>
<p>Once they had that, they'd be able to figure out just what he'd been charged with. The records of trials were supposed to be in the Ministry. They were also kept in the much-lesser known Hall of Records, where all the records created by Ministry officials were magically duplicated. No matter what had been altered in Sirius' Ministry file, and something certainly would have been, the Hall of Records file would have the original and the altered records.</p>
<p>"Where the hell is it?" Anthony complained.</p>
<p>He kept his voice down. The fewer people who knew that anyone was interested in Sirius, the better. Until they had everything ready, until they had all the allies they needed, secrecy was key. Dumbledore finding out that they were onto him would destroy all their chances of saving Harry and of knocking Dumbledore off his high perch.</p>
<p>"Can I help you?"</p>
<p>Anthony started and whirled, finding himself facing the Undersecretary to the Minister, Umbridge. She smiled, lips curling up like a toad's, and batted her eyes at him. It did nothing to hide just how curious she was about what he was up to.</p>
<p>"I swear," Anthony huffed as he tugged his hair a second time in exactly the way that always made Lacey roll her eyes at him for being overdramatic, "I've got to be going blind here. I was supposed to get the file numbers for six trials, all of them from the final days of the war and I can't find a one of them."</p>
<p>"Goodness," Umbridge said. She sidled closer and craned her short neck to look at the second of files. "It looks correct."</p>
<p>"Yeah, it does," Anthony agreed. He waved the list that Silverclaw had prepared for him to use if anyone caught him at this. "But there's no record for any of these people. I mean, there isn't even a record for Pettigrew's death in here and it should be right there. Goes right past them." </p>
<p>He pointed at the spot where the numbers were continuous but no file for Black, Pettigrew, Crouch Jr or three other minor Death Eaters should be. Umbridge snatched the list out of his hand, giving Anthony the universally arch look that women had when they thought he was being an idiot. Even Petunia did it and she'd barely met him.</p>
<p>"Let's see," Umbridge said as she flipped through the files. She paused, frowned and did it again. A third check, of potential mis-file locations earlier in time and later as well as different spots in the alphabet, gave her the same nothing that Anthony had gotten. "Well, that's not right."</p>
<p>"See?" Anthony huffed. He took the list back and scowled at it. "I must have been given the wrong dates or something. Or they're filed under different names? Even if the files were declared to be Official Secrets there'd still be a tag showing that File Number So-And-So was an Official Secret. There's sixteen of them just in this block of files alone."</p>
<p>Umbridge huffed and swelled up as she glared at the lack of files. "You're quite right. I'll have to tell the Minister about this. Such poor record keeping can't be allowed. Come with me and we'll take care of it right away."</p>
<p>Anthony grimaced. "Thank you but, um, I'm kind of wondering if I have the correct information. I mean, this is the Ministry. The files wouldn't have just disappeared. That doesn't happen here. I must have gotten bad info."</p>
<p>No, thank you, he was not going to go talk to that waste of flesh Fudge. Umbridge scowled at him and then shook her head slowly. Then she nodded, once gently, and then a second time sharp and hard and pleased.</p>
<p>"That must be it," Umbridge declared. "Do let me know if you discover that you have the correct information after all. We can't allow such slack record keeping."</p>
<p>"Of course," Anthony said. He put on his best grateful idiot smile. "And thank you so much for your help. I appreciate your taking the time out of your day."</p>
<p>Umbridge simpered at him, making Anthony's stomach roil as he desperately tried not to back away. "You're quite welcome. I must be going. The Minister needs me."</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am," Anthony said. He waved goodbye and then shuddered. Seriously, Silverclaw couldn't have made a mistake like this. Could he?</p>
<p>Nothing for it; he was going to have to go back to Silverclaw and admit that he couldn't find the files. Whether they'd been declared secrets and disappeared entirely or they just didn't exist, it was a disturbing road-block in their efforts to get Sirius out of Azkaban.</p>
<p>Harry was going to be so disappointed.</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>Every single time Harry went to Diagon Alley it was a different experience. With Hagrid, it had been magical and overwhelming. He'd barely been able to think for all the amazing things all around him. With Aunt Petunia, he'd seen the bigotry and the scary way that people only respected the amount of power you had. Literal, magical power.</p>
<p>This time with Remus?</p>
<p>It felt like they were hunted as Remus hurried the two of them towards Gringotts. They'd arrived in a little square just off the Alley itself. It was a busy place with people apparating in and out, but none of them paid attention to either Harry or Remus. Remus seemed to be glad about that because he kept his head down and his eyes low as they hurried away from the apparition point.</p>
<p>Out in Diagon Alley itself, Harry noted that no one paid them much mind. He kept his hand firmly in Remus' grip. As short as Harry was, he knew he looked much younger, maybe nine. Certainly not ten. He'd had people assume that he was only eight before, but that was when he was wearing Dudley's hand-me-downs instead of the clothes he'd bought that fit him. People seemed to take in his size, his holding Remus' hand and then Remus' aggressive lack of eye contact and looked away immediately.</p>
<p>No one wanted to know.</p>
<p>Harry blinked as Remus pulled him up the stairs into Gringotts. No one wanted to know what was wrong. They didn't want to get involved. They'd rather pretend that they saw nothing rather than have to get involved.</p>
<p>Was that what happened during the wizarding war Remus had mentioned? People saw stuff happening and then pretended they didn't so that they didn't have to do anything? If he was right, that was horrible. They'd be letting atrocities happen just because it was easier for their lives. To heck with anyone else as long as they had theirs.</p>
<p>It was an ugly realization that Harry wasn't sure what to make of, not that he had the time to fuss over it because they swept into Gringotts and found a teller immediately. Harry smiled, mouth closed the way goblins always did, up at the teller.</p>
<p>"Excuse me," Harry said, "I'd like to see my account manager Silverclaw. It's a matter of some urgency or I would have made an appointment."</p>
<p>Remus blinked at Harry as if surprised that he'd use that sort of phrasing. Or that Harry took charge, maybe. It did seem very formal but that was the sort of thing Aunt Petunia was always on Harry and Dudley to say if they needed to interrupt an adult who was working. And it was how people talked on the afternoon mysteries Aunt Petunia loved so much and those were very much like wizarding society so…</p>
<p>He shrugged mentally. If he was too formal, so be it. People seemed to like formal, polite kids, especially in the magical world.</p>
<p>"One moment please," the teller said. He dropped a note in his box, sending it off.</p>
<p>Just a moment later, no more than fifteen seconds, a goblin appeared and waved for them to follow him off into the depths of the bank. Silverclaw's office was still down a flight of stairs, through a long hallway and behind six vault doors. It had a great many account books piled high in the corners of the room and across Silverclaw's desk.</p>
<p>He scowled when the door opened but then straightened up to see Harry there with Remus. "Mr. Potter. Mr. Lupin."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry to interrupt you, sir," Harry said with his best polite tone of voice, "but a couple of problems have come to light and two of them are very urgent. I would've sent for an appointment it if wasn't so important."</p>
<p>"Please do explain, Mr. Potter," Silverclaw said. He gestured for them to come in and sit down opposite his desk which Remus did as if desperately uncomfortable to be there.</p>
<p>Harry said and frowned at the account books. "First, is this all for the audit?"</p>
<p>"It is indeed, Mr. Potter," Silverclaw said with a frustrated growl. "There are a great many irregularities that we're having to track down manually. The previous goblins assigned to the accounts have been… disciplined for their lacksidasical record keeping."</p>
<p>"Well, it might not be all their fault," Harry said. "You see, Remus has discovered that Sirius Black never received a trial. Someone shoved him in prison without any of the proper protocols being covered and without the slightest bit of common sense being used."</p>
<p>Remus chuckled, finally. "That's certainly true. You see, Sirius swore a blood oath as Harry's godfather. He also took Harry as his legal and magical heir. If he'd betrayed Lily, James or Harry, he'd have dropped dead on the spot. Someone else betrayed their location to You-Know-Who."</p>
<p>Silverclaw stared at them both for a very long while, his claws tapping against the tabletop. He finally scribbled a long note that flashed away in his box. Then he turned to Remus.</p>
<p>"Tell me everything," Silverclaw ordered.</p>
<p>"We do need to address the second and third issues, too," Harry interrupted. He bit his lip at Silverclaw's glower. "They're related. I think. Probably."</p>
<p>He explained about the weird shimmer to Remus' eyes and the way he'd behaved differently. The description of a twinkle had Silverclaw cursing in Gobbledygook, the goblin's very strange, very harsh language, that made Remus lean back in his chair as if he very much wanted to leave. Right then. Or maybe ten minutes ago.</p>
<p>"The other issue," Harry said when Silverclaw finally wound down to incoherent growls while making furrows in the top of his desk, "is my wand."</p>
<p>Explaining that whole thing, including the weird way he'd reacted to it and the fact that his response to the wand and it to him had changed after the shard of Voldemort's soul was removed, reduced Silverclaw to mumbling with his face buried in his hands.</p>
<p>"Is the boy always like this?" Silverclaw finally asked Remus.</p>
<p>"I'd assume so," Remus said. His laugh was a little strained but not too much. "His father always was. And Lily was worse. The things she got into, always without getting caught."</p>
<p>Silverclaw sighed. "Very well, Mr. Potter. We are currently working with Healer Smethwyck and Mr. Black to locate the other shards of You-Know-Who's soul. There appear to be multiple, perhaps as many as six more. We have healers on staff who can examine Mr. Lupin to ensure that he has not been compromised in any way."</p>
<p>"While I'm doing that," Remus suggested as if he really didn't want Harry to be there for it, "why don't you go see if you can find a better wand in the Potter vaults? If they don't have one that works, the Black family vaults will certainly have one, but you'll want to make sure that your escort goblin goes in with you. The Blacks have a lot of cursed items that they store at the bank."</p>
<p>"We agreed to store them for a very nice fee," Silverclaw agreed. "Is that agreeable, Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>"It is," Harry said. He paused before standing up. "Um, if something does happen or the goblin protects me from something, is tipping appropriate? I just got to that chapter in the book I got on working with goblins, but I haven't finished it yet so I'm not sure."</p>
<p>Silverclaw raised one eyebrow before smiling his tight, scary smile at Harry. "It is indeed, Mr. Potter. It is customary to offer a five knut tip for an uneventful cart ride, a sickle for prompt attendance in a vault and up to a galleon for each defense against unexpected cursed items."</p>
<p>"Thank you, sir," Harry said with his own tight-lipped smile as Goblins never seemed to show their teeth while smiling. "I appreciate your advice."</p>
<p>Remus patted Harry's shoulder as they were led out into the hallway by two separate goblins. He really would've rathered stay with Remus, but Remus looked so very relieved when Harry went the other direction that he didn't say anything. He'd just have to ask later if Remus was okay. For now, there was a new wand to find and another roller-coaster cart ride to take. Hopefully he'd end up with a wand that he actually liked after this.</p>
<p>The ride down into the depths of the bank was just as much fun this time as last time. Harry didn't whoop when they went over a particularly steep drop, but he did laugh and cheer when they whipped around a series of corners that slung them left, right and left again. The goblin laughed with Harry, so he didn't feel too bad about being improper.</p>
<p>"That's amazing. I love your carts!" Harry enthused once they arrived at a different Potter vault than his trust vault. This one was deeper than before, the air hot and humid around them like they were so deep that the heat from the core of the earth was warming the tunnel up. Or maybe they were near the forges?</p>
<p>"You are a wizard of discernment," the goblin said. He didn't look especially pleased, but he had a bounce in his step as he led the way up to Harry's vault. "This the main Potter vault. You will find furniture, paintings, books, trunks and a selection of wands inside."</p>
<p>"Perfect," Harry said. "Thank you very much. Um, can I bring the books out with me?"</p>
<p>"It is your vault, Mr. Potter," the goblin said. "You're free to remove whatever you choose. There are several library trunks on the inventory. You can use any of them with a simple tap of your wand."</p>
<p>"Ah, find a wand first, then get trunk, then books," Harry said.</p>
<p>The correct key all but leaped out of Harry's wallet when he opened it. It was the one with the picture frame embossed on the head of the key. Harry's escort goblin turned the key and pushed the door open. Harry expected to see something like his trust vault, just with piles of furniture and books rather than piles of gold.</p>
<p>What he got was neat ranks of furniture that looked like it was hundreds of years old though none of it was dusty, stacks of trunks off to the right and a table in the center of the huge room with an account book on it. The goblin nodded towards the book.</p>
<p>"Place your hand on it and request wands," the goblin said. "They will be delivered to you."</p>
<p>"Wow," Harry said. </p>
<p>The inside of the vault was considerably dryer and cooler than outside. His skin prickled at the abrupt change of temperature. The book was bound in old red leather, but it didn't look very worn out. Harry shrugged and put his hand on it as a cart screeched to a stop behind him.</p>
<p>"All the wands, please," Harry said.</p>
<p>"Harry!"</p>
<p>He started and turned, smiling at Anthony who ran up to the door as if he wanted to rush in and pull Harry right back out of the vault. His goblin and Harry's both glared at Anthony as if he was being incredibly rude.</p>
<p>Harry had barely a second to take that in because wands began flying in from vault, arranging themselves in a neat line in front of Harry. They all looked to be in good condition though the one on the far left looked like it'd been polished so many times that the wood was getting fragile. He'd seen Aunt Petunia refuse to buy an antique cedar box once that had just that same appearance.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" Anthony demanded. "They could be dangerous!"</p>
<p>"This is the Potter vault, not a Black vault, wizard!" Harry's goblin snapped. "None of the artifacts contained here are dangerous to a wizard Mr. Potter's age. The Potters wisely segregated all dangerous artifacts into a separate, highly protected, vault."</p>
<p>Harry blinked. "The Black vaults are that dangerous? Why wouldn't they… no. That doesn't matter. Why are you here, Anthony? I thought you'd be at Grunnings, working."</p>
<p>Anthony sighed and ran his hand through his hair, cheeks going red. "I was here because of the whole soul shard issue. I've taken a leave of absence since this is far more important. Remus came through and told me you were going down to the vaults so I um, got worried. You're the Heir. It's my duty to keep you safe. Though I can't exactly get in here. I'm not invited."</p>
<p>Harry frowned. He still had his hand on the account book and, well, it'd worked before with the genealogy chart.</p>
<p>"You're invited into the vault to help me pick a wand, choose a trunk for books and retrieve the books," Harry said, trying to put some intent behind the worlds. "Not otherwise, just this time. I'll consider it for other times later."</p>
<p>There was a flash of light at the door and suddenly Anthony stumbled forward. He stared at the door and then at Harry, shaking his head while laughing softly. Harry's goblin raised one eyebrow but nodded for the other goblin to go on his way.</p>
<p>"Please make sure that you take the cart ride fee from my account," Harry told Anthony's goblin. "Thank you for delivering him to me so promptly."</p>
<p>That softened both goblin's scowls. It also got Anthony frowning at him. Harry ignored the frown in favor of looking at the array of wands that other Potters had left in the vault.</p>
<p>"This one looks very old," Harry said.</p>
<p>It was a lovely reddish wood that felt warm and loving in his hand, but he could feel the way the magic flowed through it was inconsistent. There was a little bit of fluff at the tip, too, which sparkled with the magic.</p>
<p>"Ah, not that one," Anthony said. He held his hands firmly behind his back but nodded at the tip. "It's broken."</p>
<p>"The magic feels off, too," Harry agreed. "But it likes me. It's very warm. Like a hug, really."</p>
<p>The next three didn't do a thing when he picked them up. Not hot, not cold, not anything. All of them were from a silvery wood. That left him with four more wands to look at.</p>
<p>"Fleamont Potter's wand," Anthony said, pointing to a long wand with a kind of knobby handle made out of golden wood. "Euphemia Potter's wand. Your grandparents on James' side. The next one is James Potter's wand. And this final one on the right is Lily Potter's wand."</p>
<p>"How do you know that?" Harry asked. He stared up at Anthony who just grinned at him.</p>
<p>"People notice what sort of wand you have," Anthony explained. "It's a point of discussion. The wood has meaning. The cores, any foci you've added. There's whole books on what it all means in terms of power and personality, not that I'm sure any of its really meaningful. And your parents were famous. Their wands are mentioned in every biography and news report on them."</p>
<p>"Huh."</p>
<p>Harry frowned over that. That might mean that everyone was going to expect him to use the wand he'd gotten from Ollivander. He wasn't sure he wanted to explain why he wasn't. The less people knew about it, the better at this point.</p>
<p>Still, knowing that these four wands were so closely related to him made his stomach do flips as he picked his grandfather's wand up. Magic swept up his arm, powerful and commanding. It was a grown-up wand for a man who was prepared to fight battles, command people and do great things. Harry set it back down, panting.</p>
<p>"I'm not big enough for that one yet," Harry said. "Maybe I'll try again when I'm grown up."</p>
<p>His grandmother's wand was equally powerful, but he could feel… It felt like chicken soup when you were sick and cuddling under blankets. Like taking care of people and helping them be strong and healthy. Harry's breath caught as he put it down, dashing away sudden tears.</p>
<p>"Was she a healer?" Harry asked Anthony who'd put a hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p>"She was," Anthony said. "It's a healer's wand. They use different foci and cores."</p>
<p>"I can tell." Harry laughed because he wasn't going to cry. </p>
<p>He wasn't. He felt like his grandmother's wand would teach him all about taking care of people, healing them and making them stronger. Harry just wasn't sure that was what he wanted to do with his life.</p>
<p>His father's wand settled in his hand like it wanted to stay there forever. It was strong and mischievous, but the magic just didn't flow well between the wand and Harry. It was like they were slightly at different angles, so things didn't quite match up.</p>
<p>"Close but no," Harry said. "Remus said Dad was a prankster. I can feel it in his wand."</p>
<p>His mum's wand, Lily's wand, settled in with his magic and his hand like a sigh of relief. It felt as though it was always supposed to be there. As if it was just the right thing for Harry. Not necessarily forever. He could almost feel edges where it wouldn't always work right, bits where the magic wasn't a smooth fit, but right now?</p>
<p>It worked.</p>
<p>"That's good," Harry said. "Not perfect but I like it. I think it likes me, too."</p>
<p>"Say 'accio wand holsters'," Anthony instructed, showing Harry how to make a little swishing motion with his mum's wand.</p>
<p>Harry did it and a half dozen leather arm braces swooped out of the vault to settle on the table. Anthony smiled as he set to work sorting through them. He settled on one that seemed far too large for Harry, but it resized as soon as Anthony wrapped it around his arm. It fastened with leather straps around silver buttons in such a way that Harry could do it himself if he had to.</p>
<p>"A wand holster is the best way to carry your wand," Anthony said. "This one will hold up to ten wands so if you want to take more than just your mother's, you can."</p>
<p>"I'll definitely take Mum's wand," Harry said as he carefully holstered Lily's wand and then practices the little flick of the wrist Anthony showed him to release it. "Certainly, my Dad's and grandparent's, too. Maybe I'll take the silvery ones. I'm curious what they're made of and why it doesn't work for me. Still, I do want to go to the Black vaults. After I get books. There's so many things I want to learn and there's library trunks here that I can use in here."</p>
<p>"You think you need another wand?" Anthony asked with a worried frown that seemed to be all for Harry.</p>
<p>"…Yeah," Harry said, staring at Lily's wand in his hand. "This works for now but… It's like there's ripples at the edges of the magic that don't quite match up. It's close but it's not perfect. I can start with it. Mum's magic is in me, around me, so it works. But not forever."</p>
<p>"The Black vaults it is," Anthony said as if that was doom and destruction, a grim fate and a horrible trek into the darkest realms.</p>
<p>Harry really was curious about those Black vaults but if they were that bad, he was glad to have both Anthony and the goblin with him for it. After he had a library trunk and as many books as he could gather. More books was always going to be better as he learned about his new world.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Narcissa leaned against the master bedroom door, fingers shaking where she'd pressed them hard against her lips. Days of this. Days of Lucius feverish, throwing up, struggling with the pain of the Dark Mark to the point that he screamed or passed out as his magic lashed out at everyone in the room.</p>
<p>It could not go on. He'd lost so much weight in such a short amount of time, not that Lucius had ever been heavy in the first place. Now he was nearly skeletal and she just didn't know if he could survive the day, much less tonight.</p>
<p>The pain of the Mark was always worst at night.</p>
<p>No pain spell worked. Every potion she'd tried had burned off in minutes. The charms and healing medallions that had been in the Malfoy family for generations sparked lightning whenever she attempted to bring them close to Lucius.</p>
<p>If something didn't change, Lucius was going to die. That damnable mark his father had inflicted on him was going to kill him as surely as if the Dark Lord had killed Lucius himself. Narcissa shook her head.</p>
<p>"There has to be something," Narcissa whispered, glaring at nothing, at everything, at the dark wood paneling opposite her. "Somewhere. There must be something that we can do to save him."</p>
<p>"Mother?"</p>
<p>Narcissa started, turning to find Draco staring at her from the stairwell. He was nearly as pale as Lucius. She'd had to forbid him from seeing Lucius yesterday when Lucius' magic had struck out at Draco. Or maybe it was Draco's magic striking Lucius? There had been a surge of Malfoy magic between them, so violent and overwhelming that Draco had passed out and Lucius had screamed his throat raw.</p>
<p>"Darling, it's not safe for you to be here," Narcissa said. She laughed so that the tears hovering in her eyes wouldn't fall. "Honestly, it's rather unsafe for me, too. Go back downstairs, please. Or to your rooms."</p>
<p>"Mother, I've been through the entire library," Draco announced, not moving from the stairs but standing much more like a man than any eleven-year-old boy should. His shoulders were square, confident, chin raised and pale eyes flashing sapphire blue with his sincerity.</p>
<p>"Have you?" Narcissa asked. She dashed away the tears, gliding to his side to stroke his hair and cup his cheek. "All of them?"</p>
<p>"I had the elves help," Draco explained. His cheeks blushed back to a healthy shade only to fade back to sickly-pale the next moment. "Dobby helped me check even the Dark ones from Grandfather and Father. There's nothing here. Nothing at all. I don't understand why the Family Magic is attacking him."</p>
<p>Narcissa opened her mouth to comfort him, uselessly, only to freeze as his words registered. "The Family magic is attacking him."</p>
<p>"Yes?" Draco said, blinking up at her as if confused as to why she didn't know that. "That's what's happening. It's tearing him apart. I can feel it."</p>
<p>Narcissa bit her lip and then nodded. "We need to go to the bank. Right away. The Malfoy vaults don't have any books in them. Your grandfather always insisted on keeping the library here. But the Black family vaults have… well. There may be more resources there that can help. Go put on your traveling robes, darling. I need to settle your father and get the elves to take care of him. Be ready to go in ten minutes."</p>
<p>Draco's smile was like the sun braking through thunderclouds. "Yes, Mother! I'll be waiting for you in the floo room!"</p>
<p>He dashed off, already calling to the elves to get his robes ready. Narcissa allowed herself to gnaw on her lip. This had to help. There must be something, some clue of what they could do, how they could save Lucius.</p>
<p>If not, Narcissa didn't know what she'd do. She was far too young to bury her husband, presuming she survived the sudden ending of their magical marriage. Given the bond they'd always shared, she might very well not.</p>
<p>"Dobby," Narcissa called. She smiled, as gently as she could when Dobby appeared in front of her, hands twisting in the ragged dirty smock that was the only thing Lucius would allow him to wear. "Dobby, I need to make sure that Lucius is under control while Draco and I are away. It may take all the elves to accomplish it. Also," she sucked in a shuddery breath, "I need to make sure our wills are up to date in case I fail to save Lucius. I cannot allow Draco to go to his relatives. Bring me the will and warn the others."</p>
<p>"Yes, Mistress," Dobby said. He hesitated before he left, looking up at her with soulful eyes but not saying anything.</p>
<p>"Go," Narcissa said. "There's no time. No time left at all."</p>
<p>He went, finally. So did Narcissa, back into the master suite to see if she could do anything at all to soothe Lucius enough that he would change their will so that Bellatrix and the Lestranges would never gain custody of Draco, should they ever escape or be released from Azkaban.</p>
<p>That, she could never allow to have happen, no matter what it took and no matter how that ass Dumbledore muttered about 'family loyalty' and 'like to like'.</p>
<p>++</p>
<p>Anthony grinned at Harry as they followed the goblin up the path towards the main Black vault. Two and a half hours spent finding, organizing and packing up the books in the main Potter vault had been gloriously fun. While Harry was willing to take every single book they found, Anthony had very firm opinions about which books would be useful for Harry to take.</p>
<p>It nearly reached Aunt Marge's level of Very Firm Opinions on Appropriate Breeding but not quite. Harry had been able to argue Anthony into one trunk of Outdated and Outlandish Books to Read Only for Amusement, one truck of Potentially Dangerous Ideas That Could Get One in Trouble (especially if used for pranking) and one truck of books that were Very Useful and Helpful for Young Men to Read As Soon As Possible.</p>
<p>Each of the trunks was actually about the size of a big leather-bound novel, maybe ten inches by twelve inches. They were made of wood, deeply carved with flowers or vines and thistles for the prank trunk and had latches that you didn't actually need to open to get at the books inside. All you had to do was put your hand on top and think of the book and it would appear. Same for filing one. The only thing that made them trunks was that they all had a leather handle on the 'spine' of the 'book'.</p>
<p>Not that it got used much. All three of them would automatically shrink orenlarge so Harry could just put them in his pocket.</p>
<p>That the prank trunk had all come from his dad tickled Harry. The very useful ones came from all sorts of ancestors with a bunch of them from his mum. Each of the library trunks had an automatic provenance spell that told you exactly who acquired the book, when and could provide a nice library card-like report on what the subject of the book was. That'd made Harry bounce with excitement because it was so useful. </p>
<p>All three trunks were now shrunken down and in Harry's pocket where they were safe.</p>
<p>The Black family vaults were all in a block. The main vault was at the far end of a long tunnel. Side vaults and trust vaults and special ones that Harry was more than a little nervous about because they felt dark and dangerous lurked on either side of the tunnel. It felt like the torches were dimmer in front of the more dangerous vaults which might have been Harry's imagination but both Anthony and the goblin walked closer whenever they passed one so maybe not.</p>
<p>When they turned the final corner, Draco was standing with a lovely blond woman who frowned at her key as if confused. Anthony growled. Harry frowned at him and then waved at Draco who started and stared.</p>
<p>"Draco!" Harry called.</p>
<p>"Harry?" Draco said, staring at him. "What are you doing here?"</p>
<p>"That is such a long story," Harry said, groaning and rolling his eyes. "Seriously, it'd take forever to explain properly. Basically, I’m here to look for a wand."</p>
<p>He stared up at the woman pointedly enough that Draco started and bowed slightly with his hand over his chest. Both Anthony and the woman smiled at him for it. Harry really needed to ask Remus about the bow thing. Maybe there were specific mannerisms for proper bows?</p>
<p>"Please excuse me," Draco said. "This is my mother, Narcissa Malfoy nee Black. Mother, this is Harry Potter."</p>
<p>"It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Potter," Narcissa said though her expression and the cold grey cast of her eyes didn't look pleased at all.</p>
<p>"Thank you, ma'am," Harry said with as much delight as he could muster which must have been a lot because both Narcissa and Draco stared at him, lips twitching. "I didn't know that Draco and I were distant relatives when I met him. May I introduce your cousin, Anthony Black, son of Marius Black? He and his sisters were just returned to the Black Family magic and he's appointed himself my guard today."</p>
<p>Anthony laughed and ruffled Harry's hair. "I suppose I did at that. It's a pleasure, Mrs. Malfoy. I've heard about you, but never thought that we'd get the chance to meet."</p>
<p>Narcissa opened her mouth and then curtsied just like someone on Aunt Petunia's afternoon dramas. "Indeed. I felt the shift in the Black Family magic but had no idea it was something so momentous. Welcome home."</p>
<p>"So," Draco said, drawing the word out, "why are you here again?"</p>
<p>"Long story but I need a wand," Harry said. "The one that Ollivander sold me doesn't quite work because… stuff. So much stuff. My mother's wand works mostly. Not perfectly. It was suggested that I try the Black Vault but only with escorts because it's dangerous."</p>
<p>"Quite," Narcissa agreed. She stared at Harry for a long moment. "Though the locks are being difficult. They've refused my key twice so far. I'd suggest caution before attempting to open the vault."</p>
<p>Harry blinked. He stepped close and delicately touched one fingertip to her key. The magic that surged through him made him stagger backwards. Anthony was there to catch him while Draco and Narcissa both caught his arms.</p>
<p>"Oh." Harry panted. "Wow. And I thought the Black Family magic was angry before. Wow. It's… it's furious, Mrs. Malfoy. There's… a betrayal of some sort? I think. It was desperate before but now its enraged and well, um."</p>
<p>It took a bit of effort to get his feet back under him. Harry bit his lip as he studied Narcissa. She looked terribly worried which he could quite understand. He understood now what Remus had meant about magic being almost alive. The Black Family magic had changed, almost like it had woken up, when Anthony and his sisters and Lacey were added to it.</p>
<p>Now it was paying attention and there was something it didn't like at all. Something tied to Narcissa. And maybe her husband, too. It was hard to tell.</p>
<p>"Draco, can I try touching you?" Harry asked. "It's… I don't know. I need to check something."</p>
<p>"My magic, you mean?" Draco asked already holding his hands out, palms up. "Of course. We've all felt something going on the last couple of days. Father's… he's rather ill because of it. That's why we're here."</p>
<p>Harry nodded. He put his hands atop Draco's and very gently, very tentatively let his magic reach out towards Draco's. The surge was there but it was far gentler. The magic wasn't angry at Draco. Just the opposite. It wanted to protect and shelter Draco from everything that might hurt him.</p>
<p>His dad was one of those threatening things. Or, oddly, it was his father's arm. Harry frowned, gently letting the Potter magic and the Black magic touch the Malfoy magic he felt moving through Draco.</p>
<p>The image of a tattoo, no, a magical mark, of a skull with a snake coming out of the mouth appeared in his mind. It felt like the shard that had been in his scar, like the wand that he no longer wanted to use. It made all three family magics rage so hard that both Draco and Harry staggered.</p>
<p>Draco nearly fell, though Narcissa caught and held him up. Harry collapsed back into Anthony's arms, shaking.</p>
<p>"It's that mark," Harry said. "The family magic wants it gone. The Malfoy magic is willing to kill to get it out of the well. And the Black magic won't…" He looked at Narcissa who'd gone bone white, so pale that the blue network of veins in her face stood out. "The Black Family magic won't accept you if you accept it, Mrs. Malfoy. You have to choose, your husband or your family magics. And um, he's going to die if it isn't removed."</p>
<p>"But it can't be!" Draco exclaimed. "Father's tried and tried and tried, ever since grandfather forced him to take it."</p>
<p>Harry stared at him, listening to the Potter magic and the Black magic. Both of them wanted Draco. And Narcissa. And even her husband, too, if he could be freed. The Potter magic wanted them as allies against their real enemy. The Black magic just wanted them back. He hummed thoughtfully.</p>
<p>"I think…" Harry turned to the goblin who'd been quietly watching the whole thing with complete calm, as if dramatic revelations and raging family magic was as interesting as a bug crawling across a leaf. "Is there a secure room that we could use to meet in, sir? Gringotts is the most secure place we have, and I think that the family magics will help remove it. If we work together, that is."</p>
<p>The goblin nodded. "There would be a fee but yes, it can be arranged. Would secure wards and healing be required as well?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry declared. "I'll pay for it. Half from the Potter vaults and half from the Black vaults. Please arrange for it to happen. Mrs. Malfoy, Draco, go get Mr. Malfoy and bring him back to the bank. Right away. I'll hurry in here. Then we'll see if we can save your husband from that thing."</p>
<p>Narcissa shuddered, hugging Draco who squawked and flailed just like Dudley did every time Aunt Petunia hugged him by surprise.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Mr. Potter," Narcissa said. "We will be back within the hour."</p>
<p>She pulled Draco to his feet and then hurried up the hallway even though Draco kept looking back at Harry with a confused, amazed expression on his face. Harry sighed once they went around the corner, setting his head on Anthony's shoulder.</p>
<p>He probably shouldn't have made the offer, but the magic was so angry. All three magics wanted to do it. Harry couldn't deny them, not when it was to save someone the way he'd always wanted to be saved.</p>
<p>"That wasn't the brightest thing ever," Anthony said when Harry sat up and stretched, "but the magic seems a lot happier than it was."</p>
<p>Harry nodded as he tentatively touched the magic flowing inside him. "Yeah, it does. Come on. Let's get this wand hunting over with so we can check on Remus and then help Mr. Malfoy. I feel like he'd be a really important ally though I don't know why."</p>
<p>"Politics. The Malfoys are incredibly powerful politically," Anthony said immediately. He helped Harry up and then smiled as Harry gave the proper key to the goblin who pushed the vault door open. "Well, that's about what I expected."</p>
<p>"Yikes," Harry said, staring at the jumbled mess of money, trunks, books, furniture and bits of dusty fabric that lay on the other side of the door. "That's what I expected in the Potter vault. Darn. I was hoping this would be easier. Um, is there a way to organize it all before we try to search for things, sir?"</p>
<p>The goblin stared at Harry for a long moment before nodding once. "As the acting Patriarch of the Family, you can request that we organize the vault for you. Or you can do it yourself. If we find specific Dark artifacts, which I can provide a list of at a small fee, they will be seized and a weregild will be charged to your account for their destruction."</p>
<p>"That could get expensive," Anthony observed. He peered into the vault. "Might be worth it, though."</p>
<p>Harry nodded. "Okay, I'll take that list and discuss having the organization done with my Aunt. We'll let you know the decision later. Right now, it's not too urgent. Oh, except, um, do you know if anyone's searching the vaults for any more of those soul shards? Or the Black properties? Because if you're not, you probably should. I mean, if that's possible?"</p>
<p>The goblin smiled his tight-lipped smile, straightening up a bit as if he approved of Harry's suggestion. "We can but only with Patriarchal permission."</p>
<p>"You've got it," Harry declared. "The goblins of Gringotts have my permission to search all the Black vaults, all the Black properties and anything else Black-related to find any shards of Voldemort's soul. And any Potter properties, too, if there are some. I haven't had time to get to that part of the account books. Just do please be careful about it. I'd hate for any of you to get hurt in the process of finding them."</p>
<p>The goblin stared at Harry. So did Anthony. He really had to finish that book on goblin society. There had to be a reason why treating them properly was so noteworthy. Harry turned back to Anthony who blew out a breath and shook his head as if to clear it.</p>
<p>"Ready for more wand hunting?" Harry asked Anthony.</p>
<p>"No," Anthony said with a grimace at the vault. "But we might as well get this done. Let's go. The sooner you have a second wand that works, the sooner we can get out of here and deal with what the family magic wants."</p>
<p>Harry nodded. He carefully stepped into the vault with the goblin and Anthony on either side of him. He let the Black magic well up inside of him and pulled out Lily's wand.</p>
<p>He took a moment to focus his mind on finding the best wand for him to use right now, one that would help him learn and grow until he was strong enough for his grandfather Fleamont's wand, knowledgeable enough for his grandmother Efemenia's wand or whatever he became. Then he made the swish.</p>
<p>"Accio wands!"</p>
<p>The piles of stuff rumbled and shifted, sparks coming in places. A few moments later a wand whizzed out of the depths of the vault. Then a second and a third, all of them with warm reddish wood. They hovered in front of Harry with magic glimmering around them as if the Black Family magic was holding them for him until he could try them out.</p>
<p>"They're all holly," Anthony observed, eyebrows going up. "Huh. That's actually really rare. And only three of them. There's got to be more wands here, though."</p>
<p>"The wand Ollivander sold me was holly," Harry said. "Holly with a phoenix's feather core. I guess he might have been onto something, after all."</p>
<p>The wand to the left was warm and rich and powerful. It was more than Harry could handle yet, but it felt like something he might grow into. He tucked that into one of the empty slots in his wand holster. The middle wand was a softer wand, the magic delicate and light.</p>
<p>"It's… delicate," Harry said, blinking at the wand.</p>
<p>"Hm." Anthony took it and then grinned. "Charms. It'd be spectacular for charms."</p>
<p>"Huh, that's good. I have that class," Harry said. That one went into his holster, too.</p>
<p>The third wand sent a rush of magic through him that was like sweeping away all the cobwebs and throwing open the curtains after a long gloomy winter. It was walking out into a bright sunny day after hours drudging away at cleaning. It was laughter among friends, support from allies when you were in trouble, hope for the future that you knew you could accomplish. </p>
<p>He gasped, laughed and stared at the third wand, nodding.</p>
<p>"This one feels right," Harry said. "Perfect. There's no ripples or strangeness at all. It's like it's part of me and my magic."</p>
<p>"Then that's your dominant wand," Anthony said. He grinned and patted Harry's shoulder. "Ready for another ride in the carts?"</p>
<p>"Am I?" Harry exclaimed with so much joy that both Anthony and the goblin laughed at him. "What are we waiting for? Let's go! I gotta show Remus my new wand!"</p>
<p>He ran out of the vault and then ran back to get the key from the goblin. It made him blush to have forgotten it but really, who could remember a key when there was a ride in those carts coming? There was just no comparison at all.</p>

  <p>"Damn him," Remus wheezed before lowering his head over the toilet for the fourth time to throw up.</p>
<p>One would have thought that there was nothing left in the werewolf's stomach. Silverclaw, of course, knew better. The purging draughts would ensure that every potion remnant in Remus' system were drawing into this stomach where they could be properly and fully expelled from his body. Better that style of draught than the ones where the potions came out the other end. Wizards who foolishly opted for that version generally spent several hours huddled around their cramped belly as the draught worked everything through their entire digestive system.</p>
<p>At least the previous phases of his purification had gone well. For a regular wizard, it would have taken days. Werewolves naturally shrugged off control charms and mind-control spells. Silverclaw would have done quite a lot to find out how Dumbledore had managed to make the spells Remus had been under stick as well as they had.</p>
<p>"One more should do it," Silverclaw commented as Remus came up wheezing, eyes tearing.</p>
<p>"Oh, bloody hell," Remus whined. "I'm going to tear his bollocks off and eat them. I'm going to feed them to him, shove them down his sparkly throat, the utter bastard. I'm--"</p>
<p>Before Remus could go into a truly epic rant, unfortunately, the last round of the draught overtook him and he was bent over the toilet again. By the time that round of vomiting was done, Remus' whole body was drenched with sweat and his face was grey.</p>
<p>"Well done," Silverclaw said as he gently wiped Remus' face clean. "Let's get you into a bed. A bit of rest before the boy returns should help."</p>
<p>"He's…" Remus swallowed, harsh as his ravaged voice. "You have to keep him away from Dumbledore. You have to. He wants to know everything that happens to Harry. He won't let anyone control Harry but him."</p>
<p>"Dumbledore?" Silverclaw asked as his claws glowed with a cleansing spell and then a levitation spell that easily carried Remus out of the toilet and into the small, dark room that they used for recover from purging draughts.</p>
<p>"Yes," Remus whispered. He sighed once settled on the bed. "Oh."</p>
<p>"Mrs. Dursley has already ensured that Dumbledore will have little sway over the boy," Silverclaw said while settling the blanket, a nice weighted one that always soothed clients after purging. "We will ensure his safety as well. So will you, I'm certain."</p>
<p>"You don't understand," Remus whispered. His eyes barely slitted open. "It's so much more than that. He wanted me to keep Harry from learning anything. I couldn't help but tell him about Harry's books, about what he's learning. Keeping Sirius locked up, keeping Harry isolated, it's all part of his plan. He's… he's up to something."</p>
<p>Silverclaw nodded. "I do understand. Very well. We've seen Dumbledore's plotting, more of it than you have. Rest. You can't help if you don't rest, Remus. Sleep now. The boy's down in the vaults. That won't occupy him forever."</p>
<p>Remus groaned, rolling onto his side. "Gonna need a Pepper-up."</p>
<p>"Already prepared," Silverclaw said with more than a little snippiness for the stubbornness of wizards who couldn't accept that other species not only could think ahead but carry out a perfectly logical and frequently requested procedure without micro-management.</p>
<p>Remus opened one eye and then snorted at Silverclaw. Thankfully, the next moment he finally fell asleep. Good. Ragnok was going to want to know all about this and Silverclaw needed to record all the bits and pieces that Remus had gasped between bouts before he forgot the details.</p>
<p>"Or Mr. Potter does something ridiculously dramatic and world-shaking," Silverclaw muttered as he headed out into the other room to the waiting desk with his partially written report. "Takes after his whole family, that one, condensed down into one ridiculously curious and determined child."</p>
<p>Hopefully, he could get the whole report written before Mr. Potter came back. That would be a saving grace because Silverclaw could feel in his claws the way magic moved through the bank. Something momentous was coming and Mr. Potter was right at the center of it, once again.</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>Remus lay on a low couch, covered with a thick black blanket. His eyes were shut, and his skin was clammy and pale. Every breath seemed to be an effort for him, but he didn't so much as twitch a finger when Harry slowly entered the low, dark room he'd been placed in.</p>
<p>"Remus?" Harry whispered.</p>
<p>"Hey, pup," Remus whispered back without opening his eyes.</p>
<p>Pup. Something, very, very deep down, responded hard to that. Harry didn't intend to do it, but he found himself clambering onto Remus' couch, curling up with him. Remus gave a little ghost of a laugh and wrapped one arm around Harry. He set his nose in Harry's hair and just breathed for a while.</p>
<p>"Why do I smell Narcissa Malfoy on you?" Remus asked.</p>
<p>"Your nose is really good," Harry said. He grinned when Remus finally opened his eyes. "She and Draco were at the main Black vault. Mr. Malfoy's mark is killing him. Well, no, the Malfoy family magic and the Black family magic are killing him because he has the mark. She and Draco have gone home to bring him back to the bank. The Potter family magic wants to work with the Black and Malfoy family magic to try to remove it."</p>
<p>Remus stared. "You know, when I said that family magic is sort of alive, I didn't mean that literally."</p>
<p>"You should have," Harry said. Anthony laughed from the doorway. "Because it is. It really is."</p>
<p>This time Remus frowned before slowly pushing himself upright. Harry helped, supporting him as Remus groaned and wheezed and then finally managed to push the blanket off so that he could swing his feet down to the floor. He still had his shoes on.</p>
<p>"Need a Pepper-UP?" Anthony asked Remus.</p>
<p>"That would help, yes," Remus said. He swayed even with Harry's help, though he was still sitting down.</p>
<p>"What happened?" Harry asked. "You were fine."</p>
<p>Anthony passed Remus a little vial of potion that Remus grimaced at. "There are spells and charms and potions that will… sculpt your behavior, Harry. They can change the way you think and the way you act. But there's other spells and potions, a couple of very powerful and very expensive draughts, that can free you from them. And protect you from being affected for a period of time. I asked the goblins. Remus has been under loyalty and control spells since he started Hogwarts."</p>
<p>"My age," Harry said, staring at Remus.</p>
<p>Remus nodded before swallowing the potion down. Smoke billowed out of his ears, startling the heck out of Harry. By the time the smoke stopped, though, Remus was sitting up on his own and no longer clammy or panting.</p>
<p>"It won't last forever," Remus told Harry as he tucked the vial away into a pocket, "but it should let me get home. I have about two hours before I need another one or I need to sleep."</p>
<p>"That was wicked and scary, both," Harry said. "I want to know what those spells are, the ones that'll protect you from being controlled. I want to buy ones for me and you and Anthony and Lacey and my family and everyone else. Narcissa and Draco. Just… everyone!"</p>
<p>"You'd spend a ruinous amount of money," Remus protested, looking profoundly uncomfortable with the idea.</p>
<p>"Remus," Harry said. He took Remus's hand and waited until Remus met his eyes. "Money is just money. I need people. People I can trust who care about me. The family magic wants you. You're mine and I'm yours. I think I always was. Money is so much less important than you are. A dozen galleons, a hundred, even several thousand? That's nothing compared to keeping you safe as best I can. I mean, I can't do much since I'm still little, but spending money so that you're not going to be controlled again? Pfft, that's easy and I'm doing it."</p>
<p>The hug came out of nowhere. Harry squawked, just like Draco and just like Dudley, but instead of flailing Harry leaned into the hug. It felt wonderful and Harry wanted to stay there hugging Remus forever. Unfortunately, Silverclaw cleared his throat at the door, prompting Remus to let go.</p>
<p>"The Malfoys are here, Mr. Potter," Silverclaw declared. "We have them in a room with a healer. Mr. Malfoy has very little time left if the mark cannot be removed."</p>
<p>"Right," Harry said. "Come on, guys. I'll probably need your help. Silverclaw, Anthony says that there's ways to make sure that no one can control Remus again. Charms or something? Can you please arrange to purchase a full set of those appropriate for me, Aunt Petunia, Dudley, Uncle Vernon, Anthony, Lacey, Remus and, oh, how about another fifty or a hundred beyond that? I know it's going to be shockingly expensive, but I think it's important. It feels really important to me."</p>
<p>Silverclaw pulled out a tiny pad of paper, noting down his order while nodding. "It will be done, Mr. Potter. By ordering in bulk, you will receive a discount. Do you want them to be spelled to be unnoticeable and unremovable?"</p>
<p>"That's possible?" Harry said and then nodded because duh. "Yes, please. I really need more time to read up on all of this. Is there a way to make it so that the person wearing it gets apparated somewhere safe, say the bank, if the charm's overwhelmed?"</p>
<p>Silverclaw's smile said that oh yes, it certainly was but it was expensive.</p>
<p>"Good," Harry said. "I want that, too. If you can do, um, what does Uncle Vernon call it? A Quote! If you can write up a Quote for the Work Statement, I'll go over it when we're done. Depending on the cost and my accounts I might needs to um, what was it? Phase in the delivery schedule? You know, get some now, more later kind of thing?"</p>
<p>Silverclaw's smile was amused now but he nodded quite happily. "We can certainly do that, Mr. Potter. My complements on your efforts to learn proper business. It's a rare wizard who tries."</p>
<p>"That's Uncle Vernon. He's a Vice President at his company, Grunnings," Harry said as he followed Silverclaw out of Remus' little room and through a series of very finely chiseled hallways to a room with another bed, Narcissa, Draco and a very, very, very sick-looking man.</p>
<p>"Harry!" Draco exclaimed. "Please, can you help?"</p>
<p>"Oh, it won't be me alone," Harry said. "It's all of us. We have to channel the family magic. You and your dad are the keys, I bet. He's a Malfoy so the Malfoy family magic has to reject the mark on its patriarch. You are the patriarch, aren't you, Mr. Malfoy?"</p>
<p>Mr. Malfoy stared at Harry before nodding once. His white-blond hair was long, past his shoulders, and his breathing was so wobbly that Harry was surprised he was still conscious. Narcissa gently pushed him back onto the bed.</p>
<p>"Do you have any idea what you're doing, Mr. Potter?" Mr. Malfoy asked.</p>
<p>"Mm, a little?" Harry admitted. "It's more just listening to the family magic and then trying my best to follow what it wants. Okay, so, Draco. He's your dad. He's your patriarch. You're his heir. You want him but not that mark. Mr. Malfoy, you have to reject not just the mark but, well," Harry thought about it as he gently let the Potter and Black family magic swirl inside of him. "You didn't want it before. The Malfoy family magic doesn't want it. The Black family magic is ready to kill you dead right now because of it. So, you have to reject the orders that made you take it and accept the family magic as right and good and more important than anything else."</p>
<p>It sort of made sense in his head. Heart. That place inside of Harry where the magic swirled and surged and wanted with a fierce and demanding love that might just burn the whole world down if it was denied.</p>
<p>"I haven't… felt the Malfoy magic since it was placed," Mr. Malfoy admitted after a long, long moment of staring at Harry.</p>
<p>He frowned and came over to put his hand on Mr. Malfoy's arm. The snake in the mark shifted under his fingers like a real snake. Harry frowned even more. Had Voldemort forced a real snake into Mr. Malfoy's arm? Was that what was blocking him?</p>
<p>But no, it wasn't a real snake. It was like a snake, sort of, enough like a snake that Harry crawled onto the bed next to Draco and Mr. Malfoy. He waved for Remus and Antony to sit at the foot of the bed with their hands resting on Mr. Malfoy's ankles. Narcissa sat on his other side, clutching Mr. Malfoy's free hand to her chest while tears slowly and silently crept down her cheeks.</p>
<p>"Stop blocking his magic," Harry told the snake in the mark as if it was a real snake.</p>
<p>It hissed at him, angry and defiant.</p>
<p>Harry scowled and pulled on the Black magic, the Potter magic, too. "Stop blocking his magic right now!"</p>
<p>The Malfoy magic surged in Draco as the Black magic poured over from Narcissa and Anthony. The magic from Remus was wild and fierce, something completely unlike everyone else's but it helped in ways that Harry didn't understand. It made him grit his teeth and push harder and harder with his magic against the snake mark.</p>
<p>"Stop it, stop it, stop it!" Harry yelled at the mark.</p>
<p>The pressure built and built until Harry's ears popped and the room started to rattle. The bed shook underneath them, and Draco started yelling, no words, just sounds, as he gripped Mr. Malfoy's hand and bend his head. Draco's eyes were shining blue like the headlights of a car on bright. Narcissa and Anthony's eyes blazed silver-grey and Remus threw back his head as his eyes went gold and claws appeared on his fingertips.</p>
<p>Harry's hands were green from the light shining out of his eyes.</p>
<p>"Let it go!" Draco shouted at Mr. Malfoy. "Father, let it go!"</p>
<p>Mr. Malfoy, who'd lay there perfectly still, panting, jerked and bowed upwards as he then screamed defiantly. The blue, blue light in Draco's eyes swept down his hands and across them to Mr. Malfoy's arm. The light flickered in Mr. Malfoy's eyes and then blazed as a dark shadow bloomed under Harry's hands.</p>
<p>It lifted up, shaped like a skull with a snake coming out of it. The snake snapped at Harry, hissed at Draco and the others, and then screamed as Silverclaw suddenly darted in with a small crystal globe that he thrust right into the center of the shadowy spell snake.</p>
<p>The globe sucked the mark in. The world popped. So did Harry's ears. All the magic suddenly subsided, draining away faster than pulling the plug in a tub. It whooshed away like the time Dudley had broken the wall on the above-ground pool his friend Piers had set up in their backyard. It was there and then it was gone, washing gently around their feet like gentle waves on a shore.</p>
<p>Harry fell face-first into Mr. Malfoy's chest. Draco collapsed on top of him. He felt more than saw Narcissa, Anthony and Remus collapse, too. Behind him, Silverclaw chuckled.</p>
<p>"You are an amazing young wizard, Mr. Potter," Silverclaw said. "You've accomplished the impossible. We will be crediting your accounts for showing us the method of this. I'll have the healers come to tend to you all. I suspect it will be Pepper-up potions all around."</p>
<p>Harry groaned. It was meant more as a laugh, but he felt as tired as he had when he woke up after having the soul shard removed so it didn't come out that way. He did manage to open his eyes when Mr. Malfoy caressed his hair with a shaking hand. Draco curled around his back, hugging Harry and that was just as nice a hug as the one he'd gotten from Remus.</p>
<p>"I owe you a debt that can never be repaid," Mr. Malfoy whispered.</p>
<p>"Mmm, don't know about that," Harry said, smiling at him and then wrinkling his nose when Mr. Malfoy's eyebrows went up. "There's stuff. You need to know it. Later. Too tired now."</p>
<p>Mr. Malfoy laughed the barest hint of a laugh, letting his eyes drop shut. Later. After they all rested. Then Harry would tell the whole long thing, for the millionth time, and get Mr. Malfoy's help to make sure he and his family all stayed safe.</p>
<p>Later.</p>

  <p>Silverclaw stood under Ragnok's crystalline dome, shaking. His claws rattled together. There was nothing that he could do to stop it. He'd managed to keep his reaction under control until Mr. Potter and the others were tucked into the guest quarters in the healing ward but that was it.</p>
<p>After that, Silverclaw had had to sit down and let himself shake from pure reaction to what Mr. Potter had done.</p>
<p>"Sit down!" Ragnok snapped, standing and hurrying around his desk to escort Silverclaw to the chair facing his desk. "What in the name of our Lady of Magic is happening up there?"</p>
<p>Silverclaw didn't intend to laugh like a maniac but that's certainly what happened.</p>
<p>"Send for my spouse!" Ragnok shouted, to who Silverclaw wasn't certain.</p>
<p>It was so hard to think. Honestly, Silverclaw felt rather profoundly drunk. Terrified and overjoyed and floating with the sheer amount of magic that Harry Potter had unleased to save Mr. Malfoy from his father's stupidity.</p>
<p>"He's power-drunk." </p>
<p>Silverclaw blinked at Bannet, Ragnok's spouse. "You're simply not attractive enough to be consort. You've not even groomed your hair properly."</p>
<p>"Power-drunk and stupid," Bannet said with a snort of amusement and a needle-sharp teeth-baring smirk.</p>
<p>"Our Lady of Magic touched the world today," Silverclaw declared, very aware of how both Ragnok and Bannet froze, staring at him. "She reached Her hand out to a young wizard, two young wizards, who begged Her help in a formless ritual to remove the Dark Mark from a patriarch's arm."</p>
<p>Ragnok gasped, clutching Bannet's shoulder so hard that his claws cut right through to Bannet's flesh. Bannet didn't appear to notice as blood stained his healer's smock. Neither did Ragnok, astonishingly.</p>
<p>"It worked?" Ragnok asked.</p>
<p>"Yes," Silverclaw said and started laughing again. He held up his hands, staring at the magic still sparkling along his claws. "It did. It worked perfectly. The Mark was driven out. The Mark blocked Mr. Malfoy from sensing his Family Magic, from it interacting with him. I wouldn't have credited such a thing but Harry Potter-Black did what no one, not even the Goblin Nation, has been able to do: He removed a Dark Mark and purified a wizard's soul today."</p>
<p>Ragnok staggered back around his desk to collapse into his chair. "We have the Mark contained?"</p>
<p>"We do," Silverclaw said. "I had it moved to the Highest Security Vault so that it could be placed with the other shards of his soul. Mr. Potter…" He shook his head and chuckled, almost giddy. No, truly giddy. So much magic in his body and soul right now.</p>
<p>"Focus," Bannet said, drawing a bit away so that Silverclaw could function at least briefly.</p>
<p>"My thanks," Silverclaw said. "Mr. Potter authorized us to search everything Black and Potter, here in the bank and elsewhere in the world, for any other shards of Voldemort. While asking that we take all precautions that we are not hurt."</p>
<p>Both Ragnok and Bannet stared at him. Then stared at each other. Really, such an unremarkable goblin to be consort to their king. Best healer in the Nation or not, Bannet was so… plain. His claws were barely longer than his fingers and his hair was always such an utter bedraggled mess, blooming in feral curls around his head.</p>
<p>"I'll need a full report," Ragnok finally said.</p>
<p>"Not until he's rested and discharged this energy," Bannet insisted as if he was king, not Ragnok.</p>
<p>"As you say," Ragnok agreed. "Go. Rest. Do something… pointlessly dramatic with your extra gifted magic until you have a handle on it. And then write me a report on this one-time miracle."</p>
<p>Silverclaw laughed, throwing his head back and letting his peals fill Ragnok's crystalline dome.</p>
<p>"It's no one-time event," Silverclaw finally managed to say around the giddiness and the glee and the rising exhaustion. "He's showed us the method to remove Dark Marks, Ragnok. He's shown us how to save our clients from their own stupidity. And best of all, he's given us freedom to do it without paying him any percentages or royalties for using his method."</p>
<p>"…What does he want then?" Bennet whispered when all Ragnok could do was stare, open-mouthed.</p>
<p>"To save everyone we can from Voldemort and Dumbledore," Silverclaw replied. "That's all."</p>
<p>The silence stretched until Silverclaw's glee caught both Bennet and Ragnok up, too.</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>The goblins had actual guest rooms under the bank. Harry hadn't expected it. At all. They were so prickly and formal and all that he'd assumed that they would have to leave and go somewhere else to get some rest. But no, after the goblin healers declared them too magically exhausted to be moved, Silverclaw had had them all magically carried to guest rooms where they could be treated and then recuperate in comfort.</p>
<p>A lot of comfort. Harry's bed was like sinking into a cloud. He'd fallen asleep almost immediately but woken up several times because it felt like he was going to suffocate in all the softness. The third time he'd woken up gasping and flailing, the goblin who was watching over him finally asked what was wrong.</p>
<p>All it took was a muttered word in the Goblin's language and his bed firmed up until Harry sighed with relief and dropped off like a rock thrown into a deep pond.</p>
<p>It was only after he woke up again that he noticed that the bed had rich velvet drapes and a comforter so plush and thick that he hadn't needed a single blanket. The room had a desk with an ink well and paper waiting for someone to use them, carpets laid out that were so thick that his feet sank into them and enough beds for him, Anthony and Remus.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy had the connecting room with Draco. The door was open. Where Harry's room was in deep blue and purple tones, the Malfoy's room was all in sea green and yellow. Draco was awake when Harry peeked in. He smiled at Harry and came to whisper with him in the connecting doorway.</p>
<p>"They're still sleeping," Draco said so quietly that Harry could barely hear him even though they were nose to nose.</p>
<p>"Anthony, too," Harry agreed. He looked and yes, Remus' eyes had opened a slit but when Harry waved at him, Remus settled back down again. "Hungry?"</p>
<p>"Starving," Draco said. "Do you think they'll allow us food?"</p>
<p>Harry grinned. "If we pay for it, yes, of course. Come on. We'll ask."</p>
<p>Their bedrooms led to an outer room that was like a combination living room / office. There were sofas and desks, bookshelves and a nice coffee table with account books on it. Lots and lots of account books. Silverclaw peeked over the top of the stack, frowning at Harry and Draco as Harry shut the door behind him.</p>
<p>"You should be sleeping, Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy," Silverclaw said. He pushed the stack of account books in front of him to the side so that he could see them properly.</p>
<p>"We woke up because we're hungry, sir," Harry said. "Would it be possible to have food brought in? I'm sure the grown-ups will wake up soon. They'll be hungry, too."</p>
<p>"It looked like Mr. Lupin was already waking up," Draco agreed.</p>
<p>He stayed behind Harry, looking very hesitant about approaching Silverclaw. Maybe he needed to read Harry's book on goblin etiquette? Not that it mattered. Harry knew Silverclaw was on his side.</p>
<p>"I will have meals sent for, Mr. Potter," Silverclaw said. </p>
<p>He wrote a note and set it in a little tray that he'd perched on the cushions next to him. It flashed away. Which reminded Harry.</p>
<p>"Sir, would it be all right if I wrote a note to Aunt Petunia and had you send it?" Harry asked. "She has to be worried about me since I haven't come back."</p>
<p>Silverclaw smiled his tight but actually amused smile, the one that wrinkled up his eyes. "She has already been informed of your feat, Mr. Potter. Your Aunt Marge is apparently rather appalled that you've been kept overnight by 'the authorities' for questioning regarding Mr. Black's imprisonment."</p>
<p>"Oh dear," Harry said. He tried not to laugh but failed. "She must be on an epic rant if Aunt Petunia put that in a letter. I'll have to send a note back saying that it was more a matter of helping out a friend of the family."</p>
<p>He turned to Draco who stared at them both like they'd lost their minds, at least until the friend of the family bit. Then Draco's eyes went wide, and they shone sapphire blue as he grinned.</p>
<p>"I think Mother and Father would be delighted to be considered friends of your family," Draco said.</p>
<p>"It might mean getting invited to dinner while Aunt Marge is there," Harry warned Draco with a grin of his own. "Trust me. It's not a fun thing. She's behaving a lot better since we found out my father had a Duchy on the muggle side of things but she's still very pompous, very status-conscious and terribly overbearing on the best day."</p>
<p>"I think she's rather like Madame Longbottom," Remus said from the doorway.</p>
<p>"Oh, no," Draco breathed with so much horror that everyone but Harry laughed. "Really?"</p>
<p>"Who's Madame Longbottom?" Harry asked. "No, wait. First, are you hungry?"</p>
<p>"Starving," Remus said with a wry smile. "Anthony's stirring. Draco, I heard your mother call you. Very quietly but she did call you."</p>
<p>Draco immediately ran to the door to his bedroom, slipping inside. About ten minutes later, everyone was up, and they were all eating at the dining table that Silverclaw had made appear up out of the floor. It was shiny black stone, literally grown from the stone itself with a spell in the Goblin's language.</p>
<p>The food was amazing. Harry wasn't sure if it was that he was starving or if it really was that good. Either way, he ate eagerly though he did try to use proper manners. Aunt Petunia would've been really upset if Harry acted like a disaster in public, especially with allies. Or friends.</p>
<p>"I think I may survive," Mr. Malfoy said once they'd all had seconds and were now nursing their varying types of coffee or tea. His tea was almost exactly like Harry's just with a spritz of cinnamon on top that Harry was desperately curious about.</p>
<p>Mrs. Malfoy had sighed at the 'excessive' amount of milk Mr. Malfoy had used and then snorted when Harry did the exact same thing.</p>
<p>"Me, too," Harry said. "Are you guys ready for the very long story of what's happened and what we're doing that we need help with?"</p>
<p>"I think you need to apply capital letters to that," Mr. Malfoy said, eyes wrinkling with amusement. "Perhaps with Copperplate script."</p>
<p>Harry grinned. "I probably do. It deserves it."</p>
<p>"By all means, educate us," Mr. Malfoy said.</p>
<p>It took almost an hour and a half, with all the questions, side discussions, testing for compulsions and control spells, to get the whole thing out. At different points, Mrs. Malfoy's eyes blazed silver and blue. Pretty much every single point of it made Mr. Malfoy get grimmer and grimmer. By the time Harry finally got to the bit about the goblins searching for shards of Voldemort's soul in every Black vault or property, Mr. Malfoy stiffened and nodded.</p>
<p>"I believe I can help with that, Mr. Potter," Mr. Malfoy said. "Dobby!"</p>
<p>A skinny little person wearing a grubby pillowcase popped into place in front of Mr. Malfoy. He cringed and then froze, staring at Mr. Malfoy with wider and wider eyes until Mr. Malfoy pulled up his sleeve to expose where the mark had been.</p>
<p>There was a twisted, ugly scar but the mark was gone.</p>
<p>Dobby gasped. "Master has been freed! The elves felt a change, but we did not dare believe. Master has been freed at last!"</p>
<p>He flung himself into Mr. Malfoy's lap, sobbing loudly while Mr. Malfoy awkwardly patted his back and tried to get him to let go. Harry frowned, turning to Remus who had one eyebrow up as he sipped at his coffee.</p>
<p>"Who's that?" Harry asked Remus.</p>
<p>"That's a house elf," Remus explained. "They're bonded to families, sharing magic with their masters. Your parents had elves but when they went into hiding with you, they sent their elves to live with other families so that they would be safe. I don't actually know what happened to any of them."</p>
<p>Harry sighed. "Another set of books I need to read. I really need another six months or so before school starts just to get caught up to where I should be."</p>
<p>"Sadly, time turners will only give you six or so hours, Mr. Potter," Silverclaw said. "They are not recommended for children, however. Especially not for people whose magic is a turbulent as yours. You'll simply have to study as hard as you can in the time you have available."</p>
<p>Harry grumbled, set his tea down, went to one of the desks and got some paper and a quill so that he could take notes on all the things he needed to study. When he looked up, Draco was grinning at him and Mr. Malfoy looked quietly amused.</p>
<p>"Sorry, but I'll forget if I don't make a note," Harry said. "Why did you need Dobby?"</p>
<p>"Dobby, the black diary in my private office," Mr. Malfoy said. "Please go get it and bring it here."</p>
<p>"It feels nasty, Master Malfoy," Dobby protested. "Dobby doesn't like it."</p>
<p>"No, neither do I," Mr. Malfoy said. "That's why we're going to give it to goblins to dispose of it."</p>
<p>Dobby's ears perked up. He disappeared in a little pop and returned a moment later in a large pop, holding a simple black diary held as far away from himself as his arms would allow. Mr. Malfoy pinched it between his thumb and forefinger, passing it to Silverclaw who snarled at it in a surprising display of sharp teeth like a cat's. Or a shark's.</p>
<p>Huh. Maybe that was why they always smiled without showing their teeth. It was kind of like a dog or a cat. Teeth meant threat, not friendliness.</p>
<p>"I was 'given' this by You-Know-Who," Mr. Malfoy said. He scrubbed his hands with his napkin once Silverclaw took it. Dobby scrubbed his hands against his pillowcase in just the same way. "I believe that it is a horcrux. If you're gathering them, please be aware that Bellatrix received one in the shape of a cup. It should, if she hasn't moved it, be in her trust vault. There is another that I'm aware of, Salazar Slytherin's locket, but it went missing over a decade ago."</p>
<p>"The locket has been located at one of the Black properties," Silverclaw said. "This will be added to the others. The cup may be the last, but I suspect there's one more beyond it. Please excuse me. I will be right back."</p>
<p>He marched out with the diary. The instant the door closed it was like the air was suddenly cleaner. Harry blew out a breath, surprised that he'd been half holding his breath. It was like being around the diary made it hard to breathe or think or move.</p>
<p>"That hardly seems like a fair repayment of what you've done for me and the Malfoy family, Mr. Potter," Mr. Malfoy said with a little frown.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's not what I wanted," Harry said. "You see, I don't think that Voldemort is my real enemy. I mean, yeah, he's obviously an enemy. Maybe one who could harm me but he's dead. Mostly dead? Sort of dead. He's not the one who put me in a house that'd been cursed to make everyone treat me badly. He's not the one who refused me all proper medical care and education. He's not the one who threw my legal godfather in prison without a trial. And he's really not the one who loyalty charmed Remus to not ask or not care what happened to me or Sirius."</p>
<p>"Dumbledore," Mrs. Malfoy breathed with her cheeks pale and her eyes wide. "You believe Dumbledore is your enemy."</p>
<p>"Well, he's certainly not my friend," Harry said with an annoyed little snort that would've made Aunt Petunia roll her eyes. "He set everything in my life up to make me desperate for any sort of connection while denying me all sorts of knowledge. The things he spelled onto Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon's house were hurting them. The healer who worked with my cousin Dudley said that it would've slowly acted like a series of severe brain injuries on him, taking him from a normal kid to one who could never work or think or hold a proper job."</p>
<p>"He exiled my entire branch of the Black family from the magical world," Anthony said. "My wife's family is in the same condition though their connection to me is helping. They might be able to reconnect with their relatives soon. Maybe."</p>
<p>"He…" Remus shook his head and sipped at his coffee. "I'm questioning every single thing in my life. Trust me. Harry's not wrong about who his true enemy is."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, patting Remus' elbow. "Your magic already knows. Open yourself up to it and it'll tell you."</p>
<p>Mr. Malfoy finished his tea. He set the cup down and then took Draco and Narcissa's hands. Dobby put on hand on his arm and smiled as if Mr. Malfoy was hugely brave. And maybe, actually, he was after being cut off from his family magic for so very long.</p>
<p>Harry held his breath as Mr. Malfoy bend his head, eyes shut. He could feel the magic swirling on the far side of the table, but it wasn't his magic. They were closer, maybe allies, but he wasn't a part of it.</p>
<p>Blue light flared over all three of the Malfoys, sweeping out to scour Dobby clean. Dobby's pillowcase transformed into a neat royal-blue uniform with military boots in sapphire.  When Mr. Malfoy lifted his head, his eyes shimmered between cornflower, sapphire and a deep, deep blue that was almost black.</p>
<p>"You're right," Mr. Malfoy said. "You're entirely right. What do you want?"</p>
<p>"Allies," Harry promptly said. "Allies and help getting Sirius out of prison, getting Dumbledore's power cut down, and help finding more people that I can help, that I can save, that I can make friends and allies out of. That's what the Potter and Black family magics want most of all."</p>
<p>"But what do you want?" Draco asked with a thunderous frown at Harry.</p>
<p>Harry grinned and shrugged. "Friends. Friends and to know everything I possibly can before I go to Hogwarts. It's all going to get dangerous once I'm there under Dumbledore's thumb. I need whatever I can get to be prepared and I want friends at my side when I do it."</p>
<p>"You've got it," Draco declared. "I'll help any way I can. Right, Father?"</p>
<p>"Very right, Draco," Mr. Malfoy said with as proud of a smile as any Uncle Vernon had ever used. A lot less puffing up like a pigeon though. That was nice.</p>
<p>"I'll make a list," Mrs. Malfoy said. She smiled and it was as nasty as any Harry had seen from the goblins. "We'll arrange for you to meet them somewhere secure. Soon."</p>
<p>"There's a bunch of exiled descendants of squibs that I know of who want to reconnect with the magical world," Anthony offered. "Maybe we can get them back with their families."</p>
<p>"We'll have to check everyone for charms and compulsions, though," Remus said.</p>
<p>Harry leaned back in his chair, taking in the grown-ups plotting and planning how to make it all happen. He exchanged a look with Draco who seemed surprised. Honestly, Harry was a little surprised, too. But if it worked, if they could be trusted and his magic said that they could be, then Harry was that much safer now.</p>
<p>And, hopefully, they'd be able to keep it from Dumbledore until the very last minute. If not, things might get nasty sooner than Harry wanted.</p>

  <p>Anthony's mirror vibrated in his pocket. He frowned, nodded to the goblins he'd been working with to record everything that had happened with Mr. Malfoy and slipped away from them to get a modicum of privacy. Not real privacy, of course. It was Gringotts. The only true privacy was the sort you paid the goblins for.</p>
<p>"Hey Lace," Anthony said, flicking his mirror open and smiling at her. "Something come up?"</p>
<p>"Oh yea," Lacey said so grimly that his smile faded. "I've fielded eight calls from Grunnings in the last two hours. They're all up in arms about your leave of absence. The last one was from the president. He kept going on about needing you back, big negotiations, very important, but he wouldn't explain why you, personally, were needed."</p>
<p>Anthony frowned. "Did you detect anything on him?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>The simple answer drew a wince. Lacey shook her head. Nothing to say over the mirrors for fear of someone, somehow, listening in. Great. And when they'd just started making progress.</p>
<p>Probably because they'd started making progress, honestly.</p>
<p>"Right, well, I'll need to drive Harry back to Privet Drive," Anthony said. He grinned when Lacey raised an eyebrow at him dubiously. "Remus has depositions to give and he's barely recovered from the… event. Besides, I drove my sports car today. I think he'll get a kick out of it."</p>
<p>"He's an eleven-year-old boy," Lacey said, suddenly amused. The wrinkles around her eyes as she grinned were the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen. "He'll be delighted. Fine. Next time they call, I'll tell them you're on your way. Eventually."</p>
<p>"Thanks, Lace," Anthony said.</p>
<p>He made a kissy face at her and got a series of quickly flicked signs in British Sign Language. Not their usual way to conveying secret information but certainly faster than Morse Code tapped out on the mirror lids and transmitted magically.</p>
<p>Their 'shiny' problem was very aware that Anthony was all up in the magical world. He'd brought his unnatural powers of persuasion to bear on the Grunnings president to ensure that Anthony had to go back to work.</p>
<p>"Problem?" Clefttooth asked once Anthony returned to them.</p>
<p>"Yeah, Dumbledore is aware that I'm working on this," Anthony said. "I have to go back to work in the Muggle world or it will draw too much attention. Once Silverclaw gets back and Remus is up and about properly, they'll have to take over the efforts to free Sirius. I might be able to get away a few hours at a time or in the evenings, but that will be it. I can send Lacey, if that will help."</p>
<p>Clefttooth nodded. "Her assistance would be welcome. For a witch, she's moderately skilled at curse breaking."</p>
<p>Anthony let that go, because there was no point to getting in an argument about just how skilled Lacey actually was with a goblin who wasn't just about to listen, and went in search of Harry. He wasn't going to fight Lacey's battles for her. If Lacey wanted to argue with Clefttooth, she absolutely could fight him herself. Besides, he didn't want Lacey sending him to the couch for acting like she couldn't protect herself.</p>
<p>Anyway, he had more important things to take care of.</p>
<p>Like Harry, who was curled up on a couch in the guest rooms with Remus' arms wrapped around him. The poor kid looked like he wasn't sure what to do with the open affection. Those damned curses the entire family had been under must've done a number on him. It was like he didn't know how to handle people being loving towards him.</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" Harry asked.</p>
<p>"Mm, nothing too much," Anthony said. "I've got to get back to work at Grunnings. Lacey's going to take my place here. Remus, I'd appreciate it if you'd work with her and the goblins on the Sirius issue while I'm at work."</p>
<p>Remus smiled and nodded even though he looked exhausted. "I'll do that. Thank you for doing as much as you have."</p>
<p>"Eh, he's family," Anthony said. "You ready to head back, kiddo?"</p>
<p>"I suppose," Harry said. He hugged Remus, wheezing when Remus squeezed him back hard. "Are we going to floo or apparate?"</p>
<p>"I thought we'd take my Jaguar, actually," Anthony said.</p>
<p>Remus started laughing as Harry gasped and bolted off the couch like he wanted to run right out that very instant. He was so excited that he nearly dashed right past Anthony, without his notes, library trunks and his jacket.</p>
<p>"Hold your horses," Anthony said, chuckling as he caught Harry and redirected him back to his things. "Don't leave all your stuff behind. We spent too much time gathering it. I know you're going to want those library trunks."</p>
<p>"Oh." Harry stared at them and then smacked his palm into his forehead. "Oh yeah! Right. Let's get them and then go. I wanna see your car!"</p>
<p>Anthony grinned and nodded to Remus who looked hugely amused as Harry scrambled to gather up all his stuff. It was kind of nice to see him just being a kid. Now if only they could keep him safe so that he could actually grow up properly instead of whatever Dumbledore had in store for him.</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>Anthony's car was a zippy red sports car with barely room for two adults. For one adult and one kid, though, it was quite reasonable. Amazing, even. Harry would say brilliant and did about ten times as Anthony drove him home. </p>
<p>Harry waved goodbye to Anthony who revved his engine and then took off at a perfectly sedate and respectable speed up Privet Drive. He'd been driving like a race car driver up until Privet Drive so Harry watched and then laughed when Anthony whooshed around the corner as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>"Young man, who was that?" Aunt Marge demanded the instant Harry was in the door.</p>
<p>"That's Anthony Black," Harry said, grinning at Dudley who looked completely green with envy at Harry getting to ride in Anthony's car. "He's my godfather's cousin. He was involved with the whole in jail without a trial thing and since Remus had to give a bunch more depositions and stuff, Anthony volunteered to drive me home. He's really nice. He works with Uncle Vernon at Grunnings but he's taking a leave of absence to deal with Sirius' situation."</p>
<p>He babbled his way into the kitchen were Aunt Petunia was washing the teapot and a stack of teacups. Dudley followed Harry like he was attached to Harry's elbow, draping an arm over Harry's shoulders once he stopped by Aunt Petunia's side. Aunt Petunia snorted but she was smiling at the two of them together, unlike Aunt Marge who glowered, so it was okay.</p>
<p>"Aunt Petunia," Harry said, grateful that he and Draco had already worked out how to explain this little invitation, "Sirius's other cousin Narcissa Malfoy was there dealing with a problem her husband had, along with her son Draco. I was wondering if it'd be okay for Draco to come over to visit? I let Narcissa see some of the books my parents left behind in their vault," he turned to Aunt Marge, putting on his best big innocent eyes, "he was very sick from being exposed to something toxic on an antique his father left behind. My Mum had books that dealt with proper treatments because the toxin was apparently very, very old but still viable, despite being just traces picked up from an antique. The books are so fragile that they can't be handled freely."</p>
<p>Aunt Marge nodded as if that all made perfect sense which, given some of the books she'd bought and only handled while wearing white gloves and a breathing mask, she probably did. At the same time, Aunt Petunia nodded so maybe Draco's story was more believable than Harry had thought.</p>
<p>"Anyway, Draco's going to my school," Harry continued, facing Aunt Petunia again. "His mum and dad wanted to visit here before allowing Draco to visit or before allowing me to visit him at their place. Draco's going to be having a party in about a week and he wanted to invite me, but his mum said that she had to meet you first and his dad wanted to talk to you and Uncle Vernon beforehand, so would it be all right if they came to tea tomorrow or the next day?"</p>
<p>Aunt Petunia sighed. She finished drying the last teacup and wiped her hands on her dishrag. The frown was one of those really forbidding ones that said she wanted to say no, so Harry made his best 'oh please' eyes while Dudley did the same, apparently just to back Harry up. Or maybe to get a chance to ride in Anthony's sports car. Who knew?</p>
<p>"Who did you say they were again?" Aunt Petunia asked with a roll of her eyes that made Aunt Marge snort and cross her arms over her very full bust.</p>
<p>"Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy," Harry said. "Lucius and Narcissa, actually. They asked that I call them that, but it still seems weird to do so. Their only son is Draco. I think he's a little bit lonely since he's an only child."</p>
<p>Aunt Marge gasped. Aunt Petunia straightened up, eyes wide.</p>
<p>"The Wiltshire Malfoys?" Aunt Marge demanded.</p>
<p>"Um, I think so," Harry said. "They did say it was a bit of a drive to their estate."</p>
<p>"Well, it's good to see you finally making some proper connections, young man," Aunt Marge declared. "You'll want to get the good china ready, Petunia. We'll set to work cleaning the house. I don't know what we'll do about the tea treats, though. A day? Two days? What are we going to do?"</p>
<p>"I'll figure something out," Petunia declared. "Start cleaning, you two. I want this house spotless before Vernon comes home."</p>
<p>"Right, I'll just go change into work clothes, then," Harry said.</p>
<p>He ducked away from Dudley who scurried after him to whine with his face buried in Harry's pillow as Harry changed. Hedwig stared at Dudley with complete disdain. She perked up considerably when Harry petted her and then wrote a quick note for her to take to Draco.</p>
<p>"It's an invitation," Harry told Hedwig. "Draco and his parents will be visiting for tea in two days, so it has to be there as quick as possible."</p>
<p>Hedwig nipped his finger, just barely closing her beak before letting go. She hooted softly and stood still for him to attach the letter. Then she flew out the window without waiting for Harry to open it. Harry stared. He hadn't watched her go before so he hadn't realized that the spell Remus set up made it so that the window didn't exist for her.</p>
<p>"Thought I was going barmy when I saw her do that before," Dudley said from his stomach-down sprawl on the bed.</p>
<p>"I hadn't seen her do it yet," Harry agreed. "Had no idea it worked that way. Anyway, the party is all magic stuff and politics, so I don't know if you'll be able to attend or not."</p>
<p>Dudley shrugged. "I'll go if it means I can get away from Aunt Marge. She's been drilling me nonstop on proper posture, diction and breeding. You know how she gets about breeding."</p>
<p>They shared a groan and then hurried back downstairs when Aunt Petunia yelled. The rest of the day and into the night was spent cleaning the house from top to bottom. Harry spent an extra-long amount of time on the downstairs half-bath that the Malfoys would use. If they used the loo at all. By the time he'd cleaned it to Aunt Petunia's satisfaction, his fingers were prunes, his hair smelled like bleach and the loo gleamed.</p>
<p>There had to be spells for that. Especially the bit about cleaning under the toilet rim. Harry made a mental note to look for one. Maybe his mum's books had notes on that.</p>
<p>Over dinner, Harry, Dudley and Uncle Vernon all ate quietly while Aunt Petunia and Aunt Marge put their heads together to figure out a tasty, properly formal but not too pretentious menu for the tea. Harry really wasn't sure what the difference was between strawberry-rhubarb scones versus blueberry scones with almonds, but it was apparently Very Important Indeed not to give Mr. Malfoy anything with almonds.</p>
<p>The evening was spent with Aunt Marge drilling Harry on proper tea etiquette. He did get to have tea to practice with though it was lukewarm before he got to sip any of it. Aunt Petunia had already taught Harry most of the rules before. Not well enough, though, because Aunt Marge seemed to have an infinite supply of Don't Do That things that Harry was to avoid when having tea with Very Important Personages.</p>
<p>Surprisingly for a wizard, Mr. Malfoy was known to be a very rich financier of Political Issues of Great Import on the muggle side of things. Reclusive, prone to working through proxies, but still Very Powerful and Known at a Certain Level of Society, the level that Harry was going to have to step into as an adult. Aunt Marge wanted everything to go perfectly. So did Aunt Petunia.</p>
<p>Harry just wanted to survive long enough to get to go to bed and do a bunch of reading. He had so many things he wanted to study and so little time before school started.</p>
<p>Dudley spent most of that lesson sitting on the couch upside down, legs in the air and hair brushing the carpet. He'd tried to eat all of the biscuits but the first crumb that fell out of his mouth to the carpet had Dudley shoving the whole biscuit in his mouth and not grabbing any more so he wouldn't get yelled at for messing up the house.</p>
<p>About nine, Aunt Marge finally decreed Harry's skills at tea to be acceptable for a novice. He and Dudley were allowed to go to bed. At last. </p>
<p>Harry promptly ran up the stairs, Dudley on his heels. They jockeyed for the sink in the bathroom and then both closed the doors to their rooms to hide from everything adult related. Harry could hear Dudley's computer start right up even though Aunt Petunia told them to go right to sleep. He sure wasn't going to tell on Dudley as Harry wasn't going to sleep, either.</p>
<p>Hedwig wasn't back yet.</p>
<p>Which was a pity. Harry would've loved to have her sit on the headboard and groom his hair as he read until he fell asleep. It wasn't quite the same not having her there as he read. Hedwig seemed to enjoy it when he told her about the things he was learning or when he read aloud to her. And, honestly, it made the reading more fun to be doing it with someone. Even if Hedwig was just an owl.</p>
<p>Oh well. Harry would just tell her all about it later, when he could. He settled into bed with six different books stacked around him. There were so many things he wanted to learn but he was almost through the goblin book, so he started there. Then he moved onto the one about the War of the Roses from wizarding society's point of view that Remus had suggested.</p>
<p>Both the Black family and the Potter family featured very prominently in that one. He hummed and made a note to ask Remus about the Longbottom family. Apparently, they'd been allies and whatever shield brothers were since the War of the Roses when the two heirs of the families had saved each other's lives on the battle field.</p>
<p>It was past midnight when Harry finished that one and set it aside. He yawned and grumbled. If it weren't for everything going on, he'd keep reading until dawn, but then Aunt Marge and Aunt Petunia would be annoyed with him.</p>
<p>Dobby popped into the room, beaming at Harry as he held out a note. "Dobby has a reply for Master Harry Potter!"</p>
<p>"Oh, thank you," Harry said, grinning as he took the note from Dobby who squirmed happily. "You look better. Did getting rid of the mark help that much for you?"</p>
<p>"Master Harry Potter has helped more than he can ever know," Dobby declared. "All the Malfoy elves have been very, very sick because of the mark. Nasty You-Know-Who was poisoning the Malfoy magic. The bad diary and the mark both made it bad."</p>
<p>"I'm so glad that it's better, then," Harry said. He sighed and yawned, rubbing his eyes. "I wouldn't want any elf to be hurt because of all of this. I haven't had time to read up on house elves yet but it's on my list of things to do."</p>
<p>"Master Harry Potter is a very good wizard," Dobby said, patting Harry's elbow. "Dobby is telling all the elves that, especially the Black elves. They is not being able to find you and is not able to talk to anyone but the Patriarch or the heir. The old Mistress Walburga Black forbid it and there is no one to cancel the order."</p>
<p>Harry stared at him, horrified. "Are they all right? Have they got food? Are they safe? Oh, my goodness, who do I need to talk to? I gotta be sure they're okay, Dobby!"</p>
<p>Dobby stared at Harry and then clutched his hands to his chest while smiling at Harry like he was the most wonderful thing Dobby had ever seen. At the same time, tears crept down his cheeks. It was the creepiest thing other than that horrible mark on Mr. Malfoy's arm.</p>
<p>"Master Harry Potter is a very good Master," Dobby crooned. "A very, very, very good Master. Kreacher is the only elf who is hurting. He was trying to destroy one of the soul shards and was not able to do so for years and years and years. He is very sick."</p>
<p>"Um, can you tell him I want him to get medical care?" Harry said. He frowned at the stir in the Black family magic. "Or can I tell him? I can totally tell him, can't I? How do I call him? And where do I send him to get treatment?"</p>
<p>Dobby patted Harry's elbow again. "Master Harry Potter just says Kreacher's name. That will call him here. Saint Mungo's has a House Elf wing. Kreacher can go there."</p>
<p>"Right," Harry said, pushing back the blankets and then catching his books before they tumbled to the floor. "Let me put these… away. Oh. Okay, thank you, Dobby."</p>
<p>He stared as his books floated into his Important Reading trunk and then shook his head.</p>
<p>"Kreacher!"</p>
<p>The elf that popped in was bent over, sullen, grey-skinned and shaking. Harry gasped and dropped to his knees in front of Kreacher so that he could hold Kreacher up. The poor old elf looked sicker than Mr. Malfoy had, and he'd been about to die.</p>
<p>"Oh, wow, you're so sick," Harry said as the Black family magic poured out of his hands and into Kreacher. "I'm so sorry no one knew to take that thing away. It's okay. It's being dealt with now. The goblins have that and almost all the other pieces of Voldemort's soul. They're gonna destroy it all and catch Voldemort's shade and it'll be fine. Don't you worry. You just rest and we'll get you to Saint Mungo's in the morning so that they can check you out. I don't know if I can take you, but Anthony can. He's a Black, too. He has sisters and his wife has sisters, too. I'm finding all the Blacks and saving all of them that I can. Not the ones with the Mark. The family magic is really mad at them and it won't accept them but the others, yes."</p>
<p>The more Harry talked, the more magic he poured into Kreacher, the better Kreacher looked. Dobby bounced on his toes next to Harry, looking so delighted that Harry was surprised he wasn't clapping his hands and dancing in place. By the time Harry managed to stop babbling, Kreacher was standing on his own as he stared at Harry.</p>
<p>He smelled terrible and his pillowcase was even filthier than Dobby's had been.</p>
<p>"Um, are you okay?" Harry asked when Kreacher didn't say anything.</p>
<p>Kreacher sighed and glowered at Dobby who finally did clap his hands and do a little dance of joy.</p>
<p>"Kreacher is better with Heir Harry Potter's help," Kreacher said. He grumbled under his breath. "Master Sirius would be happy if Kreacher died. Master Sirius never liked Kreacher, not like good Master Regulus."</p>
<p>"Well, if Sirius is too stroppy, I'll take you as my elf," Harry declared. "I'm not letting anyone get hurt. But, well, from what Remus and Anthony and Narcissa and Lucius all said, Sirius is probably in just as bad of condition as you. We're trying to save him. I'm trying to save everyone. You can help, if you'd like?"</p>
<p>Kreacher started, straightening up so much that he didn't seem quite so old. Still filthy but not decrepit.</p>
<p>"What can Kreacher do?" Kreacher asked.</p>
<p>"Well," Harry said, "I don't know what condition the Black properties are in. They all probably need to be cleaned. And the Black main vault, just by itself, is a horrible mess. It needs to be organized and all the dangerous things in there need to be sorted out so that no one can get hurt when they go in. You obviously know how to handle dangerous things. I mean, you handled that soul shard for ages and ages."</p>
<p>"Kreacher did," Kreacher said proudly. "It hurt but Kreacher did."</p>
<p>Harry took Kreacher's hand, vowing to wash after this. "First, I want you to get cleaned up. Then I want you to get a uniform like Dobby's, just in the Black family colors. Then, after that and maybe some sleep and food, you can clean the house you were in. Then the other houses, if they need it. I mean, there might be other elves? I don't know how to tell, yet. But there's certainly cleaning to do. Once that's done, come back, and we'll talk about how to set up the vault so that it's nice and neat and organized and not a disaster area."</p>
<p>By the time Harry stopped, Kreacher was smiling and nearly as happy as Dobby who looked envious of all the things Kreacher had to do. A wave of silvery Black magic swept over Kreacher and he was clean, wearing a neat butler's uniform in silver and black that was made out of tea towels.</p>
<p>"Kreacher will do," Kreacher said. "Master Harry will call if he needs Kreacher."</p>
<p>"I will," Harry promised. "I need to sleep now. Make sure you rest and eat and take care of yourself, Kreacher. That's very important to me."</p>
<p>Both the house elves patted him like he was cute, but they disappeared, leaving Harry to lean back against his bed and sigh. Yeah, he really needed to read a book on house elves now. Maybe several. So much for going to sleep.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Lucius sighed as they stepped out of the floo and back into the safety and security of Malfoy Manor's wards. Yes, he'd been safe in Gringotts. It was, after all, the safest place in Britain. It simply wasn't home.</p>
<p>He'd been warned that everything would feel difference once he got home. That was expected given how severely the Dark Mark had blocked him from the family magic. Lucius had known that his sensitivity was reduced. Dramatically. So much so that he couldn't access or change the wards without major effort and blood rituals that verged towards illegal. He hadn't expected that he'd been that blocked.</p>
<p>The moment when he woke after the removal had been rather like gasping a lungful of air after swimming desperately towards the surface of the pond behind Malfoy Manor.</p>
<p>Damn his father for deciding that it would be the proper way for Lucius to learn how to swim when he was barely five. No child should ever experience near-drowning that way, even if Father had laughed and said that he could always sire more children if Lucius had died.</p>
<p>He chuckled. Grandmother's curse to his bollocks had taken care of that threat quite nicely. Pity that she'd ended up dead three months later in suspicious circumstances once Father realized that there was no removing the curse.</p>
<p>"What is it, Darling?" Narcissa asked.</p>
<p>"Mm, just remembering my grandmother," Lucius said. "She was… strong-willed. Lovely and smart and ferocious. Did I ever tell you that she was the one who cursed Father?"</p>
<p>Both Narcissa and Draco's eyes went wide for that. Lucius laughed, almost giddy from how wonderful he felt. The difference was amazing.</p>
<p>He could feel everything. His own magic, Draco's blooming power, Narcissa's steady strength. The elves as they moved about the manor, cleaning and maintaining the building and the magic. And the wards.</p>
<p>The wobbly, lopsided, completely messed up wards that should be protecting them far more than they were. Lucius could feel huge gaps in the wards around the property. Quite possibly, someone could walk straight through the Muggle-repelling wards rather than being directed away by them. Worse, in places they'd keep a Muggle in if they came through a hole and then tried to go back out where the wards were still in effect.</p>
<p>Weather wasn't being handled well. Flooing in and out was completely uncontrolled. Apparation was still properly prevented but only barely.</p>
<p>How lovely to see what was wrong, but goodness, he had so much to fix.</p>
<p>"Hm, I think I'm a bit drunk on power," Lucius observed as Narcissa took his elbow. He looked around. "The wards are… rather a mess, though."</p>
<p>Narcissa sighed and nodded. "I know. I've brought it up before but you were quite irrational about bringing anyone in to check them."</p>
<p>"Not anymore. I'll have to do a proper assessment and then call the goblins in to fix everything," Lucius said. He smiled as Draco took his free hand. "It's nothing more than sitting in my office and meditating, Draco. I won't exert myself at all doing it. I'd need to do it anyway given how dramatically different my magic is now."</p>
<p>"You'll be meditating on your magic for at least several months," Narcissa said with a stern look and a little sniff of disapproval. "I'll not have you straining yourself when it was so… so close."</p>
<p>Lucius pulled her into his arms and then smiled as Draco hugged them both. He couldn't remember ever getting hugs from Draco. Or giving them to Draco. If he could hire a necromancer to bring his father back, Lucius would simply so that he could kill his father several times over, just for that.</p>
<p>Making time for the meditation took until early evening.</p>
<p>There were elves to re-bond with, a huge amount of food to eat and family members to reassure. How stunning it was that Lucius could finally do that.</p>
<p>His office turned out to be horribly uncomfortable. The remaining dark magic, dark artifacts, and dark books made the place overtly hostile. The library was little better. Lucius meandered through the manor, his mind drifting through the magic that suffused the house and the wards. So many things felt off.</p>
<p>Eventually, he ended up in the kitchen. It was a place he'd never been, even as a child. Father would have had vapors if he'd seen Lucius here. Lucius settled into the heavy oak chair next to the fireplace with a smile as Dobby brought him a cup of tea with plenty of lemon and sugar. He even got a biscuit half the size of his head.</p>
<p>Lovely warm place. The magic here was quieter, gentler. There was a care to it, a harmony that nothing else in the manor had except in shards and worn strands. This felt like a home, unlike everywhere else.</p>
<p>He might as well be in Hogwarts for how homey the rest of his manor felt.</p>
<p>Lucius froze with the tea halfway to his mouth.</p>
<p>"Master?" Dobby asked. All the other elves had stopped and turned to stare at him, too.</p>
<p>"Dumbledore," Lucius whispered. He sipped the tea and set it down so that his shaking hands wouldn't spill it all over his trousers. "The manor feels like Dumbledore and Hogwarts. Not my office or library. Those feel like the Dark Lord. Everything else, though, it feels like Dumbledore."</p>
<p>Dobby blinked at Lucius, fidgeting as he tugged at his ears and danced in place.</p>
<p>"Tell me," Lucius ordered. "I need to know what you can't tell me, Dobby. No matter who gave you the order not to speak, tell me now!"</p>
<p>He reached out and seized Dobby's hands, pushing magic into Dobby with abandon. Of all the Malfoy elves, Dobby was the oldest and strongest and best trained. He was halfway wild, able to act freely in ways that the other elves could only dream of. They'd not yet grown enough in their magic to win bits of freedom away from the Malfoy magic that had been so horribly tainted by his father and the Dark Lord.</p>
<p>Dobby gasped, bowing his head as he started to glow. It took a startlingly large amount of power before Dobby's head snapped up as he stared into Lucius' eyes.</p>
<p>"Dumbles changed wards," Dobby said. "When yous asked for sanctuary, he came. He spelled old Master Malfoy to sleep and then changed the wards. Old Master Malfoy couldn't feeling them, not with bad Mark on arm. He came again and again after yous was Marked. I tries to keep him out, keep the magic safe but Dumbles was too strong. His wand didn't letting me say no. No one can say no to Dumbles when he uses that wand."</p>
<p>"I'll need you to show me everything he did," Lucius said as he relaxed the flow of magic and then clung to Dobby's hands. "Every single thing. I'll have to pay the goblins to come fix it and we'll need to make sure every trace of his power is removed. As soon as possible, it has to go. All of it!"</p>
<p>Dobby nodded, eyes intent and angry as Lucius couldn't afford to be right now. His control over his magic was too tenuos and his health too fragile for Lucius to indulge in a rage. Dobby held Lucius' hands until the terror-shakes subsided enough for Lucius to stand and head back to his tainted office so that they could start writing it all down.</p>
<p>Fixing this couldn't happen soon enough.</p>
<p>He couldn't allow Dumbledore to have access to Draco. Or Harry Potter.</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>"Kreacher?" Remus asked for the third time.</p>
<p>His shocked disbelief hadn't faded at all despite Harry explaining the whole thing twice. Remus seemed completely befuddled by the idea that Kreacher had needed help. That he'd agreed to let Harry help. And the idea that Kreacher was even now cleaning the Black properties up as Harry'd ordered.</p>
<p>Which he was. Harry could feel it, way back in the still-angry Black magic. There'd been ripples from the house elves all along, but Harry hadn't been able to figure out what they were. He'd honestly just assumed that magic moved around and did stuff on its own until he met and connected to Kreacher.</p>
<p>Now he could feel the six Black house elves' magic mixing with and stirring up the Black family magic. It was kind of like eddies in a slow-moving river. Each of the elves pulled magic into themselves, swirled it around inside of them and then let it go free again.</p>
<p>The weird, and super-brilliant, part was that the magic that went through an elf got changed. It was cleaner. Stronger. Healthier. It was like they somehow made the family magic stronger than it had been before.</p>
<p>Even Kreacher who was doing much, much better now that Harry was paying attention to him and pushing a thread of magic his way every half hour or so.</p>
<p>"That's…" Remus shook his head, turning to Anthony who snickered at him. "I don't know what to say."</p>
<p>"Hooray?" Anthony suggested. He laughed out loud when Remus glared at him. "Seriously, it's making a difference. Harry's awareness of the elves has already brightened up the family magic. I mean, it's still furious about Bellatrix and one of the cousins who's in France. They're both marked. But other than that, it's better than it was."</p>
<p>"All right then," Remus said. "I guess I can just accept it and move on. Now, what about this party?"</p>
<p>"Well, Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy are coming for tea to properly meet my guardians," Harry said. "Draco's coming because he didn't want to stay home alone, which I completely understand. Then, a couple of days after Aunt Marge leaves, Mrs. Malfoy is going to have a 'going away to Hogwarts' party that I think, probably, is for the parents to rejoice and lament over their precious little darlings going off to school."</p>
<p>Harry rolled his eyes when Remus grinned. Anthony lounged against the window frame of Harry's room, next to Hedwig who seemed distinctly unimpressed with him, but she leaned into his fingers as he idly scratched her head. She'd come back early in the morning, waking Harry up from his face-down sprawl on his third book on proper care and feeding of house elves.</p>
<p>"I have a hard time believing that Narcissa Malfoy is that sort of mother," Remus said. He paused and then laughed quietly. "Then again, she's exactly that sort of mother. I'm sure Lucius will be even worse, especially now."</p>
<p>Harry grinned at him. "That was my impression, too. I already accepted our invitation and requested that Neville Longbottom be invited. From that book on the War of the Roses you gave me, the Potters and the Longbottoms have been allies forever. I'd like to meet him before the train if I can."</p>
<p>"Good plan," Anthony said as Remus nodded his agreement.</p>
<p>"In the meantime, I'd really like it if you guys could help me learn the bare minimum of stuff I should've known already about magical society," Harry said. He waved at the stacks of books on his bed and on top of the Important Books trunk. "I'm kind of overwhelmed here. There's just so much that I keep running off into weird research paths and losing track of what I should've been studying."</p>
<p>Remus smiled. "I can't tell you how many times Lily did exactly that. I still have the study guide she created for herself. I'll bring it over tomorrow for you to work from. Well, after I update it. There's a bit that she should've had on it and didn't."</p>
<p>"Lacey's already building a plan for you." Anthony nodded to Remus. "Probably not far off what you've got, Remus. I had one I put together, but it was really haphazard so it's no use to copy from it. Lacey's already taken the good bits from it. We'll get you set up."</p>
<p>They chatted together about all the subjects that Harry needed to know. Oddly, they left out all the noble stuff and everything about the Wizengamot. Harry made a note to ask Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy what he should learn on that. It was important, so he'd need to know all that whether they remembered it or not.</p>
<p>Over the next several hours, Anthony was in and out as he fielded calls from the solicitors he had working on freeing Sirius. He got even more calls from Grunnings, all of which Anthony replied to by promising to be back later that day. Aunt Marge had dragged Dudley off to a museum when he'd complained about all the lectures being too dry to remember without something visual.</p>
<p>Harry was pretty sure Aunt Marge lecturing at you in museums was worse than lectures at home with Aunt Marge. At least at home there were biscuits and you didn't have to have your best manners on all the time. Dudley'd been enthusiastic about it, though, so obviously he must disagree. He certainly came home about two much more cheerful than he'd been in the morning.</p>
<p>Either way, four o'clock hit with everyone in their best clothes, the house absolutely perfect and Ripper sitting at Aunt Marge's feet like the best trained dog in the entire world. Harry really needed to remember to ask Remus how he did that so he could do it in the future.</p>
<p>It wasn't until Aunt Petunia glanced at the clock just shy of four that Harry wondered whether Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy would want to come by magic or by car. Magic made more sense, right? Except that they'd said in their acceptance that they'd arrive conventionally, so car made more sense. Hopefully. The last thing Harry wanted was Aunt Marge to get obliviated and then be even worse than she normally was.</p>
<p>"Whoa," Dudley breathed from his place at the front window. "They've got a Bentley, Dad!"</p>
<p>Uncle Vernon and Aunt Marge both rushed to the window to stare out at the big black car that pulled up in front of Privet Drive. Harry could just barely see it through their elbows and wow, the entire neighborhood was going to be gossiping about this for the next decade. No one had driven a car like that on this street before. Maybe ever.</p>
<p>When the driver opened the passenger door, Mr. Malfoy stepped out and then carefully helped Mrs. Malfoy out. He was in a very nice, very Muggle charcoal grey suit with a pale silver shirt and an ascot. Mrs. Malfoy had on a lovely pale silver and blue dress that looked like it'd been made specifically for her out of clouds and rain.</p>
<p>Draco looked like Draco but with big awed eyes, a delighted grin and a silver and green shirt under his charcoal grey suit jacket.</p>
<p>"Vernon!" Aunt Petunia hissed and that was all it took for everyone to remember what they were supposed to be doing.</p>
<p>Uncle Vernon was perfectly polite inviting the Malfoys in. Mr. Malfoy was a little too pale and a little bit wobbly but not as bad as he had been so that was reassuring. And, as they all settled in the sitting room for tea and strawberry-rhubarb scones with honey butter and chocolate biscuits, Draco kept edging a little closer to Harry and Dudley as the grownups talked about politics, the terrible economy and the Difficulties in the Labor Market Right Now.</p>
<p>Harry poured when he needed to. He did his best to look like he was listening. But wow, all the grownups seemed really invested in the discussion about the economy and once the scones and biscuits were gone, both Dudley and Draco started fidgeting. Well, so did Harry but he was going to blame them for starting it if anyone asked.</p>
<p>"Goodness, listen to us go on," Mrs. Malfoy said with a fond look at Draco who sat very straight and very still the instant her eyes turned his direction. "Why, we must be boring the boys silly."</p>
<p>"I could show Draco my room," Harry suggested. "Or the garden?"</p>
<p>"Go on upstairs, boys," Aunt Petunia said. "Try not to make a mess and do keep the noise down, please."</p>
<p>Dudley was off the couch like a shot with Draco right on his heels. Harry followed them, giving the adults a little half bow, hand over his chest just like Draco always did and like Anthony had said was proper and formal and appropriate for a tea party like this. All the adults smiled at him for it, even Aunt Marge.</p>
<p>Then Harry ran up the stairs and gladly shut his door against all the adult nonsense.</p>
<p>"She's horrible," Draco breathed, eyes wide.</p>
<p>"Aunt Marge?" Harry asked.</p>
<p>"Yes!" Draco exclaimed from his perch on top of Harry's school trunk. "I had no idea anyone Muggle could be that bad. She dropped every single important ancestor she had into the conversation sixteen times. I counted!"</p>
<p>Dudley snickered from his sprawl on Harry's bed. "Yeah, she's always terrible. Sad part is that just who she is. I mean, Mum, Dad and I were all cursed to be terrible. Aunt Marge just is terrible."</p>
<p>"Cursed?" Draco asked, turning to Harry.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Harry agreed. "It's all fixed now. Lacey, Anthony's wife, fixed it for us. She's a curse breaker."</p>
<p>"Good," Draco said. "So, why'd you ask for the Longbottoms to come to the party? My mother wasn't entirely certain on that."</p>
<p>"Oh," Harry said as he pulled out his Important Books library trunk and summoned the book on the War of the Roses that Remus had given him. "It's in here. See, the Potters and the Longbottoms have apparently been shield brothers since the War of the Roses."</p>
<p>"No way, you have ancestors who were in the War of the Roses," Dudley exclaimed because, oh yeah, Harry hadn't had time to tell Dudley about that. </p>
<p>The three of them ended up on the floor, books spread out around them, debating and discussing all the history of the various families in the Sacred Twenty-Eight and how they all intertwined and mingled with Muggle nobility. Dudley had way too much fun poking at Draco's pride in his family's history even though the Malfoys had apparently gotten themselves into five or six different blood feuds, one of which was still going on.</p>
<p>"What in the world happened with the Weasleys?" Harry asked once Draco admitted that yes, his father was still fighting a rather modern and low-key feud with Arthur Weasley. "Why would you guys be doing that?"</p>
<p>Draco grimaced. "Dad says that it was all because one of the Malfoy daughters married into the Weasley clan and ended up dead because of an arranged marriage that the Weasleys refused to give up even though she'd fallen for someone else. My mother says, privately, that it's because both the Malfoy and the Weasley men have um, too much temper and not enough sense."</p>
<p>Both Harry and Dudley laughed at that one, even though it made Draco glare at them with snapping cobalt blue eyes and a furious flush across his cheeks.</p>
<p>"I think you Mum's right," Dudley said when Draco looked like he was going to hold a grudge for them laughing. "You guys do have too much temper."</p>
<p>"And not much sense," Harry agreed. He raised an eyebrow when Draco opened his mouth to protest. "Your dad stood still and let himself be marked, Draco. I would've run to the other end of the world instead of allowing it."</p>
<p>"You can't just… leave your family," Draco said, shifting position uncomfortably. "The family magic pulls at you. You have to feel it."</p>
<p>"I do," Dudley said so immediately that Harry stared at him. "Really, I do. I mean, not at first but once the curses were gone and the blocks that kept me from learning were removed, yeah. It's there, always tugging at me."</p>
<p>"Is that why you're always hugging me and stuff?" Harry asked.</p>
<p>"Mmm, kinda," Dudley said while thoughtfully staring at the ceiling and wiggling his toes as if he wanted to pace but didn't want to get up. He shrugged after a second. "I mean, I feel bad about the bullying. That's part of it. But the magic is part of it. I want you to be happy and healthy and strong and stuff. You do better when you get hugs. And it's nice, anyway. We should've been like twins and that Dumbledore made it so that I hated you for no good reason."</p>
<p>Draco frowned at them. He shook his head as if he wasn't going to ask the questions that hung in his eyes. Instead he waved at the books between them.</p>
<p>"Is there anything more?" Draco asked. "Mother is always after me to study more but I never do. The books we have are, well, biased. And kind of horrible, really. Father couldn't buy books that disagreed with You-Know-Who, even after he was killed. Mother tried to bring things in for me, but most of the time Father would fly into a rage and burn them the instant he found them. I never got to read more than a chapter or so of any of them."</p>
<p>Harry stared at Draco, appalled. Dudley snatched up several books, clutching them to his chest.</p>
<p>"Not anymore!" Draco huffed at Dudley. "Father's promised Mother that she can completely redo the wards on our estate and update the library once I go off to school."</p>
<p>"That doesn't do you any good," Harry said.</p>
<p>"Exactly," Draco agreed. He frowned at the books. "I know I need a lot of these but I'm not sure what exactly to ask for."</p>
<p>"Remus and Anthony and Lacey gave me a study guide," Harry said. "It covers most everything they think I need to know for the… well, for the rest of my schooling and into university. Why don't we make a copy for you and then you can take it your parents? You can get a library trunk like mine and you'll be ready for school."</p>
<p>"I want a library trunk," Dudley complained. "It's not fair that I don't get one."</p>
<p>"Squibs can't use library trunks," Draco said so completely dismissively that Harry frowned at him.</p>
<p>Dudley snorted and grabbed Harry's Only For Amusement library trunk, putting his hand on it and summoning out a book. "It works. I'm not allowed to have one at school, that's all. Which is totally unfair because these are amazing, and I want to read all the things. It's fun reading when you can actually remember stuff and the words stay still for your eyes."</p>
<p>Draco's jaw dropped open. "How…?"</p>
<p>"Squibs have magic," Harry explained. "If an artifact is set up right, they can use it without a wand. Library trunks don't need wands. They just need intent and attention. You need to want to put a book in or take it out and you need to pay attention so that you summon the right book. There's a lot squibs could do if they were allowed to be part of magical society."</p>
<p>"Harry and me've been testing it," Dudley agreed, sitting up a little straighter with pride. "We've been taking notes on it and everything. Proper scientific testing. We've run trials. There's loads of little things I've been able to do that are magic."</p>
<p>Draco frowned, leaning forward to put his elbows on his knees as his eyes went silver-blue and very, very bright. "Show me. Show me everything."</p>
<p>Harry grinned and did just that. Who knew? Maybe Draco would have some more ideas of what they could test. Harry didn't have the power to change the laws regarding squibs yet, but when he was older, he would. It'd be good to have evidence to back up his desire to change those stupid laws.</p>
<p>Besides, it was fun testing things with Dudley. A lot more fun than endless lectures on genealogy and history and proper behavior. Adding Draco to the testing was great. They got another data set and that was sure to be helpful.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Silverclaw hummed as he examined the wardstone buried deep under Malfoy Manor. It was a lovely stone, as tall as he was with a beautiful smoky white swirl the spun up the lavender length of it. The Malfoy ancestor who'd created the wards had spent a fortune on them.</p>
<p>"Pity the wards are so badly degraded," Silverclaw commented. "Generations have gone by since they were updated and maintained."</p>
<p>"My father claimed that he'd had it done," Lucius said from his spot by the heavily warded door into the wardstone's room. "He would never tell me what was done. Grandfather claimed that he'd had an expert work on them."</p>
<p>Silverclaw snorted. "Expert. A rank amateur with delusions of grandeur, you mean. I've seen his mark on wardstones many times before. He hasn't a clue what he's doing. Every single ward scheme he's touched is riddled with holes."</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>The grimness of Lucius' tone turned Silverclaw away from the wardstone. Pure fury suffused the pale face, making his eyes snap sapphire blue to ice blue and back again. The wardstone barely responded to him which was just another sign of how badly degraded the wards were. It should have been crackling with Malfoy magic, responding to its patriarch's fury.</p>
<p>"Dumbledore," Silverclaw said. "The fool fancies himself a ward master."</p>
<p>Lucius' breath caught. He shut his eyes, visibly counting to ten. Then twenty. Fifty. He finally opened his eyes at one hundred.</p>
<p>"Don't assume that the holes are accidental," Lucius said, words clipped as he glared at the unresponsive wardstone.</p>
<p>Silverclaw stepped away from the stone. Tapped his claws together and then gestured for Lucius to follow him back out of the wardstone's room. They returned to the surface, then went to Lucius' office which was, thankfully, much improved by his team's work purging the place of dark influences. It would only be fully repaired by the wardstone work, but it was much better than it had been when they'd arrived.</p>
<p>"Deliberate," Silverclaw said after he'd sent the team to go work on the library next.</p>
<p>"I have to believe that it is," Lucius said. "Dobby gave me a full report."</p>
<p>He passed a stack of neatly written records, then went to get them both a glass of firewiskey. Silverclaw nearly stared at the wizard as Lucius passed him one of the two glasses. Never in all his years working for the bank had a wizard shared his alcohol with Silverclaw.</p>
<p>Mr. Potter had in fact worked miracles, it seemed.</p>
<p>Silverclaw only made it through two pages before he threw the firewiskey down his throat. Dobby reported a clear pattern of destruction. Every time Dumbledore visited the Manor, the wards were dismantled, bit by bit by deliberate bit. The Malfoy family magic must have slowly lost their grip on them until Dumbledore had more power over the house than its owners did.</p>
<p>He'd seen this before.</p>
<p>Several times. More than a dozen times, actually. Worse, he'd gone back to the Longbottom manor at least six times after fixing them for Madame Longbottom, and every time the wards had degraded dramatically. Madame Longbottom had scoffed at his warnings, claiming that she had nothing to worry about when it came to Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Many of the others had claimed the same.</p>
<p>"How many places has he destroyed?" Lucius asked after finishing his glass. He looked blackly furious, eyes snapping and hair stirring on his shoulders with his magic's fury.</p>
<p>"At least a dozen," Silverclaw said as he scanned through the rest of the reports. "The Chieftain will want to see this. A copy, compensated of course, would be appreciated."</p>
<p>"That copy is intended for you," Lucius said. He smirked as Silverclaw's head snapped up. There was very little humor in those blue, blue eyes. "The only compensation I require is getting the wards fixed and the manor purged of dark artifacts, spells and books before the day's end."</p>
<p>Silverclaw raised an eyebrow. "That quickly? We usually spend a week preparing. The work itself can take longer."</p>
<p>"Harry Potter and his family will be coming to tea tomorrow," Lucius said.</p>
<p>Silverclaw nodded, folded the report and tucked it into his pocket. "If I may use your floo, I will call the bank and have three full teams come to ensure that it's done before nightfall. The Chieftain is… quite interested in ensuring Mr. Potter's safety."</p>
<p>"As are we all," Lucius said. He set his glass down with a decisive click on his desk. "Follow me. The sooner it's done, the happier I shall be."</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>Malfoy Manor was a great huge mansion. Somehow, Harry had not expected that. They'd all driven to town, Uncle Vernon frowning over the directions that Aunt Petunia read off for him. Harry had kind of expected that they'd drive all the way there, but the instructions had them stop at a little village and park their car.</p>
<p>"Harry!" Dudley had hissed, elbowing Harry hard enough that he nearly knocked Harry off his feet with an incoherent wave of his magic that, thankfully, didn't show to eyes at all. "Oops, sorry. Look! Remus has a horse-drawn carriage!"</p>
<p>He'd pointed across the village square to a real, live, actual carriage like what Aunt Petunia loved to watch in her period mysteries in the afternoons. Remus waved to them, laughing when Harry and Dudley dashed over to him. Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon followed way slower. Grownups. They never knew when the really brilliant stuff was happening.</p>
<p>"That's amazing!" Harry had told Remus. "Are we riding in this?"</p>
<p>"Yes, we are," Remus had said, grinning at them both. "Mr. Malfoy sent it for us. Cars don't run well around Malfoy Manor. Around most magical places, really. The wards interfere. And yes, that's in your study guide, Harry."</p>
<p>"Brilliant," Harry had said while Dudley checked out the carriage and asked the driver a thousand questions that the driver had just smiled at without answering.</p>
<p>The ride had been smoother than even Anthony's car. Remus had explained to Uncle Vernon that there were special cushioning charms that made the ride smooth no matter what condition the road was. Explaining how they couldn't be used for cars and Muggle roads had taken until Dudley had exclaimed and pointed out the window at Malfoy Manor.</p>
<p>Huge. It was enormous, four stories, big and black with a Gothic feeling that Harry thought only existed on the telly and not in real life. The grounds were surrounded by a big black stone wall topped with black iron spikes.</p>
<p>He felt the wards when they crossed them. There was a moment of wariness and then Harry felt the Malfoy magic recognize him and welcome him in. Remus had started at the shift of the magic. So had Dudley.</p>
<p>Aunt Petunia just pursed her lips and sighed through her nose like it was irritating to be wrapped in warmth and the faintest hint of blue.</p>
<p>Her dress was pink, so maybe the blue was annoying. Harry was never sure when it was Aunt Petunia. Even without the spells that had messed with his ability to understand people and their ability to like and care about Harry, he had a terrible time understanding Aunt Petunia.</p>
<p>"They have peacocks!" Dudley exclaimed once the carriage stopped in front of Malfoy Manor's grand, imposing staircase. "They're white, Harry. Pure white."</p>
<p>"Wicked," Harry breathed, leaning against Dudley so that he could peer out the window and see the peacocks.</p>
<p>"Boys, it's time to go," Aunt Petunia said in her 'move along now, no dawdling' voice.</p>
<p>Draco and Mr. Malfoy stood at the top of the steps waiting so yeah, it was time. Harry grinned at Draco who grinned back for just a second before putting a serious face back on. Mr. Malfoy smiled at them just a hint distantly, but it was a lot like Aunt Petunia's slightly distant smiles when people tried to ask rude or impertinent questions about Uncle Vernon's position at Grunnings or why Harry's hair was always a complete disaster.</p>
<p>"Welcome to Malfoy Manor," Mr. Malfoy said much more warmly than his expression might have promised. "Please, come in. The other guests have only just begun to arrive. Most are apparating in or taking the floo."</p>
<p>He scanned the driveway as if expecting trouble. It was like he thought they might be attacked at any moment. When they were all inside, Mr. Malfoy sighed like he was relieved and then nodded for Draco to lead them out of the imposing entryway with all its marble and granite and onyx towards a side room that turned out to be a very nice parlor about the size of their entire house. No one else was there yet but Harry could hear voices heading their way from another part of the manor.</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" Harry asked Mr. Malfoy quietly. </p>
<p>Remus had stayed by Harry's side which was odd given that Remus really didn't do that all that much when they were around people he trusted. Harry knew Remus trusted Mr. Malfoy.  Mostly. They'd talked about the things Mr. Malfoy had been forced to do and how he'd fought to keep Mrs. Malfoy from getting sucked into all the awfulness.</p>
<p>Mr. Malfoy's father had been even worse than Uncle Vernon at his worst under the curses. A lot worse.</p>
<p>"There have been… comments made," Mr. Malfoy said so cautiously that Harry's magic stirred inside of him. "About my activities. About Mr. Lupin's. Your Anthony's activities as he attempts to get Sirius out are drawing quite a lot of attention we might not want. I made a point to invite the Bones family and the Weasley family, though the Weasleys have yet to reply with an acceptance or a refusal. Amelia and her niece Susan will be here. They are people you should cultivate."</p>
<p>"Amelia Bones is very important in the Aurors," Remus agreed. "We're going to try to talk to her about Sirius at some point today."</p>
<p>Harry nodded, then frowned. "I want to talk to her, too. It feels important."</p>
<p>Both Remus and Lucius looked unhappy about that, but Harry just met their eyes as seriously as he could without putting much magic at all into his eyes or his hair or letting it dance on his skin. It did feel important, very important. One way or the other, he knew he needed to talk to Ms. Bones. If he had to, Harry was absolutely going to be all pushy and loud with his magic about it but not unless it was necessary. That'd be rude.</p>
<p>Mrs. Malfoy appeared at the door on the opposite side of the parlor. She had a very nice ice-blue floor-length dress that looked very much like it'd come from Aunt Petunia's historical dramas, complete with plunging neckline and puffy sleeves. With her was a very stern looking blond woman with a black dress, black boots that looked like they could stomp through the floor if she wanted, and a young girl about Harry and Dudley's age who was just as blond but much, much more hesitant about entering the room.</p>
<p>Harry waved at her and then went over to join them.</p>
<p>"Ah, Harry," Mrs. Malfoy said as if surprised that he'd come over right then. "May I introduce Madame Amelia Bones and her niece Susan? Susan will be in your year at Hogwarts. Amelia, Susan, this is Harry Potter."</p>
<p>"It's so nice to meet you!" Harry exclaimed, offering a hand to Madame Bones because while he really wanted to make a good impression it was important that he got a feel of her magic and how angry it was. "The Potter magic has been poking me about meeting the other heirs to the founders' magic. I'm so glad that you came."</p>
<p>Madame Bones' mouth dropped open, but she gamely took Harry's hand. "A pleasure, Mr. Potter. I can't say that I expected… to meet you. Today."</p>
<p>She stared at his hand where his magic and her magic were swirling and sparking and making popping noises, all without Harry doing a thing. Aunt Petunia sighed and put her hand on Harry's shoulder.</p>
<p>"Harry, do let go," Aunt Petunia said.</p>
<p>"Um, sorry, but… oh, there we go," Harry said when the magics let go of them. "Wow, that was odd. That's never happened before. Huh. I suppose that's yet another thing for me to research. I wonder if I have any books on the founders and their magic?"</p>
<p>Harry shook his hand, flexed his fingers, and only then dared to look up into Madame Bones' eyes. She was pale. A little angry looking, but it didn't seem focused on the here and now. She turned to Susan who had gone very, very pale indeed and clutched her hands to her chest like she was afraid for Harry to touch her.</p>
<p>"Don't fuss over it, Susan," Madame Bones said. "The magic had something to tell me and it was… loud… about it."</p>
<p>"I didn't know magic could do that," Susan protested.</p>
<p>"Well, my cousin Dudley and I have been doing some tests and it seems like family magic is much more aware than people think," Harry said. He gestured to Dudley who bowed, properly with his hand over his chest like Draco had taught them. "It's really amazing. I mean, if you want to hear about what we've found."</p>
<p>"Squibs have far more magic than most people think," Draco agreed, doing the bow thing, too. He gave Harry a dirty look for not having bowed.</p>
<p>Harry rolled his eyes at Draco and waved towards the buffet set against the windows that overlooked the garden with its formally cut hedge maze and strutting white peacocks.</p>
<p>"There's food, too," Harry said. "I think there's more kids coming, and I know the grown-ups have a bunch of stuff to talk about. Come join us?"</p>
<p>Susan pursed her lips but nodded. She loosened up when Draco started putting tiny pastries and itty little tarts on a plate for her, commenting on which ones were his favorite but choosing the ones she liked best once she expressed an opinion. Pretty soon the four of them were curled up together in one of the window seats discussing all the things that Dudley could do that squibs were absolutely, positively not supposed to be able to do.</p>
<p>"Another for your group, Harry," Mrs. Malfoy said, startling all four them. "Neville, this is Harry Potter, his cousin Dudley, my son Draco and Susan Bones. Everyone, this is Neville Longbottom. His grandmother is ah, rather busy talking with Madame Bones, Remus and my husband at the moment or I would introduce her as well."</p>
<p>Harry craned his neck to peer past her and wow, 'rather busy' seemed to be Narcissa Malfoy code for cursing someone out while threatening to brain them with her very imposing umbrella. She had a huge, enormous, ridiculous hat topped with what looked like an entire taxidermied vulture. It didn't at all go with her Edwardian-style purple dress that made her bust look six times bigger than it should.</p>
<p>"Um, thank you, Mrs. Malfoy," Harry said. He gulped when both Remus and Mr. Malfoy took big steps back from Neville's grandmother. "I appreciate the offer of introductions."</p>
<p>"And the privacy spell," Susan said, staring at the confrontation with just as much fear as Harry.</p>
<p>"Do stay here until… oh, my," Mrs. Malfoy went stiff as Aunt Petunia straightened up and glared at Neville's grandmother in that going to strip paint from the walls with her glare sort of way she had when she was really, really irate. "Do excuse me, children."</p>
<p>"Stay out Aunt Petunia's way," Harry advised.</p>
<p>"Yeah, Mum will set her to rights," Dudley agreed. "Might wanna get Dad out of the way, but Mum will be fine."</p>
<p>Mrs. Malfoy stared at them both for a long moment but turned and hurried back to the other side of the room. As soon as she left, their little corner seemed to develop a kind of curtain between them and the rest of the occupants. They weren't invisible or anything, just hard to see. It was as if there was a white gauze curtain between their window nook and the rest of the room.</p>
<p>Harry frowned. He really wanted to poke it and see what it was made of, how it was done, but Neville looked as though he was about to pass out.</p>
<p>"Come sit down," Harry told Neville. "It's all right. There's a bunch of stuff going on that'd make anyone lose their temper."</p>
<p>Dudley barked a laugh. "Oh yeah, Mum actually cursed a week or so ago. I'd never heard her use those words before. My dad just about fainted when she did."</p>
<p>Neville stared at them both. He was a bit pudgy but in the not quite grown into his size way that Dudley had had a couple of years ago. Harry was pretty sure that in a couple of years Neville would be very big and very strong, though maybe not as big as Dudley and Uncle Vernon.</p>
<p>Either way, he sidled closer, sitting on the very edge of the window seat until Harry pulled him closer. They both gasped at the way their family magic danced between them. Harry found himself leaning against Neville's side, laughing quietly as the Potter green and Black silver made ribbons of light around them with the Longbottom teal-yellow-green. It kept changing colors like leaves in the autumn which was brilliant.</p>
<p>"Wow," Neville whispered.</p>
<p>"That's amazing," Susan agreed.</p>
<p>Draco nodded, frowning at Harry as if jealous.</p>
<p>"The Longbottoms and Potters have been shield brothers since the War of the Roses," Harry explained.</p>
<p>"Yeah, we got a book on it!" Dudley exclaimed. He waved for Harry to pass over the library trunk which Harry did. "Several of them. This one's the best, though. Lots of interesting stuff in there about both families. I think the Malfoys and the Bones are in here, too, but we didn't spend much time reading up on them since we didn't know you then."</p>
<p>"Oh, really?" Susan asked with much more interest.</p>
<p>By the time they'd gone through all the books that Remus had given Harry on the War of the Roses, the books on history Lacey had insisted that they needed to read, the books that Harry's mum had had in her library, Draco lost his jealous expression and sat on the floor with Susan who pored over the books while Dudley happily explained all the things he'd learned about both Muggle and Magical important families and how they tied together in a zillion ways.</p>
<p>Harry stayed with Neville who seemed more than happy to just watch and listen.</p>
<p>"You all right?" Harry asked Neville.</p>
<p>"I… guess so," Neville said. He sucked on his bottom lip, shrugging one shoulder. "Just. I always thought I was a squib."</p>
<p>"No, definitely not a squib." Harry laughed. "The way our magic reacted says that. Aunt Petunia and Dudley are both squibs. Magic works really different for them."</p>
<p>Neville sighed. "It's just. My grandmother gave me my dad's wand and it doesn't really work for me. I thought it was me."</p>
<p>"Dudley, I need the trunk," Harry said. </p>
<p>Dudley didn't hear him, too deep in his explanation to Susan of all the testing they'd been doing. Thankfully, Draco did. He grinned and passed the trunk to Harry who pulled out the book on wand lore he'd been studying before bed the last couple of nights. It wasn't really on the list of subjects for him to study, but Harry found it fascinating, so he'd made time for it.</p>
<p>"Well, this says that sometimes a family member's wand can refuse to work for you," Harry said, flipping to the right section. "And, actually, my dad's wand isn't right for me at all. My mum's wand is pretty close but not perfect. Anthony and I went through the Potter and Black vaults to find wands that would work. I found one that's perfect, but I still don't know whose it was. Maybe you just need a different wand."</p>
<p>"Oh," Neville breathed as he read over Harry's shoulder. "I don't know that Gran would allow it but that'd be nice."</p>
<p>Aunt Petunia was still glaring at Madame Longbottom but neither of them was talking. All the talking was being done by Madame Bones, Remus and Anthony, all three of whom looked like they wanted to go punch someone in the face.</p>
<p>"Let's do it before she notices, then," Harry said with a huge grin that finally caught Dudley's attention.</p>
<p>"Do what?" Dudley asked.</p>
<p>"Test different wands for Neville," Draco explained. "His dad's wand doesn't work very well for him."</p>
<p>Harry started pulling wands from his holster, passing them around so that all of them could try them. His primary wand didn't work for anyone at all though Dudley got a little bitty shimmer of magic from it that didn't do anything at all. It was more like Dudley's magic was saying hello to Harry's wand as it passed through his hand. That was the only wand that did anything at all for Dudley.</p>
<p>His other holy wands kind of sparkled for Susan but weren't right at all. His grandmother's wand blazed happily in Draco's hand. He stared at it with a kind of awe that Harry completely understood. None of the adults noticed, though, so Harry kept passing out wands.</p>
<p>The first silver-finished cherry wand worked for Susan and Draco, enough that they both kind of nodded that it was acceptable. Before Neville even touched it, the magic was swirling between him and the cherry wand. Harry grinned.</p>
<p>"Looks like cherry is your wood," Harry said while Neville gaped at the wand. "I've got two more. See how they work."</p>
<p>"I don't, I can't, um," Neville spluttered but he set down the first cherry wand and took the second.</p>
<p>Magic soared around him, through him. It blew away the privacy spell that had been secluding them and set a green-teal-gold breeze full of sparkles shaped like leaves around the parlor. All the adults froze, Madame Longbottom staring at Neville with so much shock that she looked like a fish out of water despite the vulture on her head.</p>
<p>"It's perfect," Neville breathed.</p>
<p>"Then it's yours," Harry said, putting the third cherry wand and the first back into his holster.</p>
<p>"I can't take this!" Neville protested. "It's yours!"</p>
<p>"Neville," Harry said with a little laugh as he pushed the wand back against Neville's chest. "It's your wand. It doesn't work for me at all. I only took it out of the vault because I was curious how it was made. Take it. It's clearly right for you and that's all that matters."</p>
<p>Neville shook his head even though he clutched the wand desperately as Madame Longbottom stalked over.</p>
<p>"The Patriarchs of our families have been shield brothers for generations," Harry declared before Madame Longbottom could open her mouth and forbid it, which she looked like she wanted to. "Our dads fought together. So did our grandfathers. We don't have any battles to fight yet, but I can have your back on this. Take the wand. It's made for you. It's meant for you. It's yours. I mean it, I want us to be friends and allies just like our families have always been. It's a little enough thing on my side, just a wand I can't use, that I didn't even have to pay for. But it's big for you and, really, I want you to have it. Please accept?"</p>
<p>Both Draco and Susan's eyes went very wide when Harry said the shield brothers thing. Madame Longbottom stumbled to a stop, Aunt Petunia standing stern but approving at her side. Behind them, the other adults watched Neville more than anyone else.</p>
<p>Neville sucked in a breath as he studied the wand, running trembling fingers over it. After a moment he nodded even though Madame Longbottom made a little protesting sound in her throat. Then Neville smiled, bright and happy, despite the tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>"I'd like that," Neville said. "Thank you for the wand, Harry. I'll do my best to be your friend and your shield brother, no matter what happens in the future."</p>
<p>"That's all anyone can ask," Harry said. "Friends, too?"</p>
<p>"Friends," Neville agreed.</p>
<p>He offered his hand and Harry took it, grinning as the Longbottom and Potter magic swirled between them with the Black magic spiraling around them both. Harry laughed and then hugged Neville who hugged him back with as much strength as Dudley at his most determined. Another ally. Another friend. Good.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Amelia Bones rarely found herself infuriated.</p>
<p>Well. </p>
<p>That wasn't true. Society was ugly, stupid and brutal, full of people who would be better off if they ceased breathing. The upper echelons of society would be greatly improved if over half of them were thrown in prison or executed outright. She'd spent most of her career in a constant state of fury over the stupidity and abuse that the weaker and more innocent members of magical society endured.</p>
<p>The day that the Wizengamot, under Albus bloody Dumbledore's twinkly-eyed approval, had disbanded the Magical Child Welfare department had been the last time she'd been so angry that she couldn't breathe or see straight.</p>
<p>Today? Was worse.</p>
<p>"You're sure that it was Dumbledore?" Madame Longbottom asked for the sixth time. Her hands shook so badly that she'd put down her tea and clenched them in her lap while sitting so straight that her back and neck had to ache.</p>
<p>"Yes," Lucius said again.</p>
<p>There was no doubt in his voice, nothing but venom and fury in his eyes. Thankfully, all the children were outside because the sheer fury swirling in the room had the plaster peeling from the walls and the carpets slowly shredding under their feet. Neither Narcissa nor Lucius looked terribly upset about that. They were both doing the most damage, as was appropriate given that it was their home and their wards.</p>
<p>"The wards were repeatedly undermined by Dumbledore," Lucius repeated. "Dobby gave us a very detailed accounting of it. He's hundreds of years old, the strongest elf we have, and he was able to resist the worst of Dumbledore's memory charms. He couldn't break the conditioning entirely, but he could remember what happened. And he could report on it all in detail once I ordered him to tell me."</p>
<p>"Silverclaw has seen the same pattern of ward destruction," Narcissa continued as Lucius shut his eyes and worked to control his temper before he broke the couch underneath them. "He's seen it in at least a dozen cases. According to the reports from the bank, they've seen it in every single household of the Sacred Twenty-Eight."</p>
<p>"I'll string him up by his bollocks," Madame Longbottom snarled, green and gold magic swirling so violently around her that it made that ridiculous vulture on her hat flap like it was going to take flight to hunt Dumbledore down.</p>
<p>"That won't accomplish anything," Petunia Dursley said in such a calm, cold voice that it shut down Amelia's magic, Lucius' and even Madame Longbottom's.</p>
<p>"What'd'you think we should do, Pet?" Vernon Dursley asked with a look that could fairly be described as worshipful. And besotted.</p>
<p>Amelia's lips twitched at the two of them, despite the rage and the betrayal and the entirety of her family magic screaming for her to claim the Hufflepuff legacy. When Harry shook her hand, it woke something so deep, so powerful, that she'd nearly dropped to her knees.</p>
<p>If he was raised by Petunia Dursley, no wonder he was such a powerhouse. And so surprising.</p>
<p>"Remus," Petunia said. She smiled as Remus sat up straighter, tugging his vest down as if he was worried he wasn't presentable. "Anthony. We will need to know exactly who's been affected by His meddling. They'll need to be notified of it somehow, preferably in a way that will keep That Man from finding out about it. I doubt that we'll keep it a secret for long but really, we just need to keep things quiet long enough to deal with Voldemort."</p>
<p>"…You're so very casual about that," Amelia observed, breathless with shock.</p>
<p>She flinched as Petunia's pale eyes turned her way. There was so little magic in her, not enough to change her eyes or her voice or her hair. And yet, it felt like facing down the strongest Archmagus, like battling a whole hoard of Death Eaters.</p>
<p>Whatever magic Petunia Dursley had, large or small, she'd honed it to a razor's edge. Amelia had no doubt that Petunia Dursley could use her small talent in ways that would terrify any sensible wixen.</p>
<p>"Casual about what?" Petunia asked with one eyebrow raised. She looked like the perfect ivory sculpture of a woman, poised and calm on her couch with her massive husband fidgeting next to her.</p>
<p>"Using the Dark Lord's name," Amelia replied because she was not, ever, showing weakness around this woman. The casually calm way that she ordered everyone about and they snapped to attention was not something that Amelia was prepared to admit that she admired.</p>
<p>And envied.</p>
<p>Petunia snorted, curling her lip. "Lily told me once that she suspected that 'Voldemort' was a pseudonym. You do realize that it literally means 'flees from death' in French, don't you? Hardly the name of someone to fear."</p>
<p>"No, actually, I didn't realize that," Amelia said far too faintly. </p>
<p>She blew out a breath, looking at Narcissa who nodded thoughtfully, Lucius who sneered as if hearing Voldemort's name was offensive to him now, and Madame Longbottom who scowled, white-knuckled, at the floor where the carpet had been well and truly shredded into fluff.</p>
<p>"Now you know," Petunia said, turning back to Remus and Anthony. "Do make sure that you get to work on it as soon as possible after this is over. I'd rather the children didn't know. They've enough to worry about with school and That Man."</p>
<p>She turned to Madame Longbottom who raised her chin but nodded approvingly once, as if she was looking forward to whatever orders Petunia had to give.</p>
<p>"I would strongly suggest getting the goblins in to repair your wards and scan every single member of your family for spells, compulsions and charms," Petunia said. "You'll need to be checked as well. I'd suggest that for you as well, Madame Bones."</p>
<p>Amelia snorted. "My entire department is getting it. If I have my way, the entire Ministry will be as well, though that idiot Fudge will probably protest the expense."</p>
<p>"Politicians." Petunia shook her head and sighed. "We'd best plot out how to get around his stupidity, then. Who has suggestions?"</p>
<p>Amelia leaned back in her chair as Vernon, Lucius, Anthony, Remus and Madame Longbottom immediately started throwing ideas into the hat. How long had Petunia worked to be able to command people this way? She'd known Lily back in school. Despite their obviously family resemblance, Lily was nothing like Petunia at all. Where Lily was bright and carefree, Petunia was cool and controlled.</p>
<p>In another life, if they'd met when Amelia was much younger and Petunia was unmarried, Amelia could have followed Petunia around like a love-struck puppy. She was halfway there already and that was just ridiculous at her age.</p>
<p>"No," Amelia said as Anthony began building castles in the sky about a simple policy change. "I don't have the authority to tell any other department to do anything. I can order my aurors to get tested and purged. I can't do that to anyone else. Try again."</p>
<p>Anthony looked to Petunia before sighing and giving up on his wild scheme.</p>
<p>Really, what was her gift and how had she become such an effective leader?</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>"Quidditch is stonking great fun," Dudley wheezed from the spot on the ground where he'd landed after being thrown from his borrowed broom during their game.</p>
<p>"He's mad," Draco hissed at Harry.</p>
<p>"Uncle Vernon's a rugby player," Harry said with a shrug. "It runs in the family."</p>
<p>They'd all headed outside after lunch, mostly to escape the endless politics the grownup were fussing over. Between Madame Bones' fury over Sirius being imprisoned for nothing and Madame Longbottom's spluttering outrage that she'd abused Neville by forbidding him to have a wand that worked for him, Remus and Anthony and Lucius had been talking about votes and power blocs and changing laws while clearly avoiding something Inappropriate For Young Ears to hear.</p>
<p>All of which Harry knew as Very Important Indeed. His magic said so. Everything he'd read said so. Aunt Petunia said so outright while scolding all the kids for being restless.</p>
<p>The problem was that it was boring. </p>
<p>There was nothing Harry could do about it for years and years and years. It wouldn't help him deal with Dumbledore when he went to school. It wasn't going to protect anyone he cared about. And, really, the manor was gorgeous and huge and the gardens were right there!</p>
<p>So, Mr. Malfoy had suggested that the kids go out and play Quidditch to burn off some extra energy. Quidditch turned out be the wizarding version of rugby with more balls, fewer rules, played while flying on brooms. Dudley fell in love with it instantly, especially once he discovered that if Harry activated a broom for him, he could totally fly on it.</p>
<p>The two of them were menaces in the air, so proclaimed first by Susan who was fast and nimble but a little hesitant. Then by Neville who was a disaster in the air and knew it. And then by Draco who was very, very good but not as good as Harry and Dudley together.</p>
<p>Didn't matter how good you were on a broom when you took a play bludger to the chest that knocked you right off the broom though.</p>
<p>Harry grinned and offered Dudley a hand up.</p>
<p>"Let's do it again!" Dudley exclaimed only to scowl when Susan and Neville started laughing. "What? That wasn't nothing. I'm not even winded."</p>
<p>"He should play pro Quidditch," Neville said. He actually grinned, a bright, sunny smile that made Harry happy to see.</p>
<p>"That'd be so brilliant," Dudley said, staring at the hoops overhead. "I love this game. It's way better'n Rugby."</p>
<p>"I don't even know what 'rugby' is and I think you're crazy," Draco complained.</p>
<p>Uncle Vernon made a horrified noise from behind Harry. "Not know what rugby is? That's terrible!"</p>
<p>"Is it time to come in, Uncle Vernon?" Harry asked before Uncle Vernon could launch into his standard impassioned speech about how Rugby was The Best and Most Important Sport in the World.</p>
<p>"Yeah, it is, Harry," Uncle Vernon said. He ruffled Harry's hair and then helped brush Dudley off.</p>
<p>Dudley did his part for avoiding the inevitable speech by explaining Quidditch as excitedly as Uncle Vernon always did rugby. It worked for about ten paces and then Uncle Vernon launched his speech when Dudley took a breath.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Neville, Susan and Draco all found it fascinating. They asked dozens of questions as they walked from the Quidditch pitch back to the Manor and then through a bunch of very formal, very posh hallways to get back to the parlor. Dudley shrugged at that. Harry shook his head. Maybe it was more interesting if you hadn't heard it at least three times a week for your entire life?</p>
<p>The parlor they ended up in was a completely different room, much smaller and warmer with eggshell blue plastered walls and a mural of the sky outside that moved and shifted to match the actual weather. All the sofas and chairs were covered in sapphire blue leather that squeaked when you sat on them.</p>
<p>"I trust you behaved yourself, Neville," Madame Longbottom said while staring at Neville as if she'd never seen him before.</p>
<p>"Yes, Gran," Neville said.</p>
<p>"Dudley's crazy for Quidditch," Susan told Madame Bones. "He should be a professional Beater. He'd clean up."</p>
<p>"Can't be as good as rugby." Uncle Vernon huffed and opened his mouth to continue, repeat? His lecture. Aunt Petunia glared at him and he subsided. "Well, it can't, Pet. Rugby's the best game."</p>
<p>"Yes, Vernon," Aunt Petunia said in the rolling her eyes voice without actually rolling her eyes. "If we could get back to the matter at hand, please?"</p>
<p>Both Anthony and Remus looked hugely relieved. They'd heard Uncle Vernon's rugby lecture quite a few times so they had to be glad to have it stopped before it could get started. Lucius smiled and nodded to Aunt Petunia so graciously that he got a stern look from Narcissa who wrapped one hand around his elbow and leaned against his side.</p>
<p>Grownups. Seriously. They were both married. Like anyone would try to get between Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon or Lucius and Narcissa. That'd be rude. And stupid given how stuck they were on each other.</p>
<p>"I've had the house elves working to spy on Dumbledore's activities," Lucius said. "They discovered some… very worrisome information. It appears that Dumbledore has been systematically working to undermine the power, authority and family magic of every single member of the Sacred Twenty-Eight."</p>
<p>"He told me outright that my Neville had very little magic," Madame Longbottom said, scowling at the floor. "Said there was no point to getting Neville a wand from Ollivander's."</p>
<p>"He was the one who suggested that I use Dad's wand," Neville told Harry. "He just chuckled and patted my head when I said it didn't like me that much. It was like he thought that was a good thing or something."</p>
<p>"I… I went to Dumbledore and begged for sanctuary when my father insisted I take the Dark Mark," Lucius said. Narcissa's fingers tightened on his elbow. "He refused. Outright. I was escorted from the school directly by my father and given no chance to escape. Several years later, my father told me that Dumbledore had flooed him to inform him of my request for sanctuary. He said that Dumbledore framed it as 'keeping families together' and 'a parent's love for their child'."</p>
<p>Harry stared at him. "That's horrible!"</p>
<p>"I checked the school charter," Anthony said, tossing a battered old book onto the coffee table lurking between them. It took his nod at the book for Harry to realize that the old book was the charter. "Lacey and I should've never been denied the right to attend Hogwarts. Remus shouldn't have been the only… Ah, sorry, Remus."</p>
<p>"I have a medical condition," Remus said, glaring at Anthony with gold-flashing eyes, "and Dumbledore made it seem that he was breaking the rules by allowing me to attend. The… way we handled my monthly flare-ups was horrible and completely unnecessary. The school had specific rooms set aside for someone with my condition that were spelled to ensure that I would be safe, healthy and unaffected for the most part. He tortured me monthly while spelling me to absolute loyalty to him, personally."</p>
<p>Harry frowned. Why do all that? It didn't make sense. Everything he'd read said that Dumbledore was a good man who'd defeated an old, evil wizard. He was supposed to be the best Light wizard on the planet but nothing he'd found out since he got his letter had been the actions of a good man.</p>
<p>Maybe Light didn't equal good? Well, Dark certainly didn't equal bad because both Narcissa and Lucius were Dark wizards. Come to that, Harry wasn't entirely certain what the distinction between Light and Dark magic were. He'd have to look that up later tonight.</p>
<p>"Why?" Susan asked. "Why would he do all that?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, Susan," Madame Bones said with a scowl that matched the worst of Aunt Petunia's. "At this point, I don't care. I have enough information to get Sirius Black out of Azkaban. I'm just not sure where he can go that would be safe enough. It's no good to get him out if he immediately gets murdered."</p>
<p>"Oh," Harry said. "Kreacher!"</p>
<p>Kreacher popped in, bowing to Harry. "Master Harry wants Kreacher?"</p>
<p>Harry grinned at him. He looked so much better than he had before. His hair was fuller, skin clearer and much brighter. His clothes were perfectly pressed and absolutely clean. Even his little leather shoes were polished until they reflected Kreacher's face.</p>
<p>"I'm so glad that you're doing better, Kreacher!" Harry exclaimed. He offered his hands and Kreacher laughed as he took them. The magic swirled happily between them. "Yes, I do need your help. I know you're not happy with Sirius but we're about to get him out of Azkaban and we need an absolutely secure place for him to go that no one can get at without permission."</p>
<p>Kreacher nodded. "Black Castle is best place. Itzy is head elf for Black Castle. Kreacher goes back to organizing the vaults?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said. "Just make sure you're careful and rest and eat."</p>
<p>Kreacher patted Harry's knee fondly. "Kreacher will, Master Harry."</p>
<p>He popped away, leaving Remus and Narcissa both staring at Harry like he'd done some sort of miracle. Remus whined, waving at Harry while looking to Narcissa who delicately shrugged as if it was beyond comprehension. Madame Bones raised an eyebrow at Harry and Madame Longbottom made a gobbling goose noise while staring at him, too.</p>
<p>"He looked really healthy," Neville commented when no one else would say a world.</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah," Harry said. "He was trying to destroy something terribly dangerous and it hurt him really badly. When I found out, I summoned him and insisted that he heal and eat and sleep. And then I had him go clean up the house he'd been in. And I set him to organizing the Black vaults because they're a disaster. Just utter chaos, Neville. It was horrible!"</p>
<p>"Might have to have our elf do that with our vault," Madame Bones muttered to Susan who nodded eagerly.</p>
<p>"Anyway, I noticed after that," Harry continued, "that when family magic goes to an elf it's like they… clean it? Scrub it and wash it and then let it back loose into the family magic pool. So, I've been pushing particularly dark and ugly tendrils of magic to Kreacher and he's been cleaning them up. He's good with dark stuff like that and careful so it's helped both Kreacher and me and the family magic, too."</p>
<p>"We really have to do that, Aunt Amelia," Susan said with a very serious stare at her aunt.</p>
<p>"Gran, I think we need to, too," Neville said to Madame Longbottom.</p>
<p>"I suppose we do," Madame Longbottom said. "Well, summon your Itzy and we'll see if we can keep Sirius safe. If not, it might be better to leave him there."</p>
<p>Harry shuddered as the Black family magic raged at the suggestion. "No. That's not going to happen. One way or the other, we need to get him out and heal him. He needs help and he's the Black family patriarch. He must be saved."</p>
<p>Itzy appeared before Harry could do more than think of his name. He was a little shorter than Kreacher, wearing a similar uniform, and had longer vividly silver hair that he'd braided back into a queue.</p>
<p>"Master Harry needs Itzy?" Itzy asked. His voice was even squeakier than Dobby's.</p>
<p>Harry offered his hands and grinned when Itzy stared a moment before taking them. The magic swirled between them in gentler ways than it had for Kreacher. Harry had been so worried for Kreacher that he'd really shoved magic at him. Itzy didn't need quite that much but he definitely needed some magic given to him.</p>
<p>"Do all the elves need this?" Harry asked Itzy.</p>
<p>"Itzy thinks all Black elves would welcome it," Itzy said, ears quivering as he clung to Harry's hands. "It is good for elves. But what did Master Harry need?"</p>
<p>"Well, we're going to get Sirius out of Azkaban," Harry said. "So, we're gonna need healers for him and someone to help him deal with the emotional trauma and food and shelter and new clothes and probably a new wand but Kreacher is dealing with the vaults so he can probably find one of those."</p>
<p>Itzy nodded. "Itzy can do this."</p>
<p>"We also need a safe place for Sirius that no one, especially Dumbledore and his allies, can get into," Harry said. "I mean, I don't want him to be isolated, but he needs to be kept safe until we can get his case before the Wizengamot. He was never given a trial and that's horrible."</p>
<p>"Black Castle is best place," Itzy said slowly, frowning deeply while clinging to Harry's hands and gently tugging at strands of Black magic that were sad and lonely and hurt feeling. Harry fed them to Itzy and he sighed happily. "Needs wards upgraded, though. Will need the goblins to help with that."</p>
<p>"I'll contact them," Aunt Petunia promised. "As soon as we're home."</p>
<p>"Good," Itzy said. "Itzy will go make Black Castle ready. He will have list of healers and soul healers to choose from by morning. And yes," Itzy smiled at Harry with one eyebrow raised as if he was being silly, "Itzy will rest and sleep and eat, Master Harry. All the elves are because it matters to Master Harry. Master Harry should summon Bitsy, Zing, Lenny and Crow later. They should all meet Master Harry, too."</p>
<p>"I will," Harry promised. "Thank you, Itzy."</p>
<p>"Master Harry is welcome," Itzy said before popping away.</p>
<p>The Black family magic already felt better. Harry shook his head, laughing softly while rubbing his chest. It really was amazing what the elves do. He needed to find more books about the elves so he could find out how they ended up taking care of families. There had to be some history there.</p>
<p>"Right," Madame Bones said. "Let's figure out how to get Sirius out and to safety. That's the most important thing to get done next."</p>
<p>Harry nodded. They didn't have much time left before the will reading and going to school. Only another week. He really didn't know if they could get everything done in time but at least he could trust Remus and Anthony and the Malfoys and now the Bones and Longbottoms to help make sure that Dumbledore was stopped.</p>
<p>He'd be isolated at school. It was very good thing that he had adults who could take care of stuff while Harry was stuck under Dumbledore's thumb.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>For a man who'd spent most of his life anywhere but in Britain, Anthony was learning the Ministry building's warrens entirely too well. He followed Amelia as she stomped her way to the lift down to the Department of Mysteries. She scowled at everyone in their way, sending a couple of very junior clerks flat against the wall in terror of her.</p>
<p>Not that Amelia was half as scary as Petunia in a snit, or Lacey in a rage, but yeah, he got it. He wouldn't want to be on the receiving end of Amelia's tongue-lashing either.</p>
<p>The Department of Judgement'd been a total wash-out as far as getting an order to release Sirius. They'd freely accepted that nope, there was no record of a trial, no witness records, not even an order remanding Sirius to Azkaban. Everyone there'd agreed that it was an outright travesty of judgment.</p>
<p>They still wouldn't sign an order to release Sirius Black.</p>
<p>So Amelia'd swelled up with outrage, gone icy furious, and ripped them up one side and down the other in the most scathing language possible. Hadn't worked. Eventually, she'd given up and stomped out of the room with Anthony on her heels.</p>
<p>"You think the Department of Mysteries will allow it?" Anthony asked once they were in the lift. Alone. Two wizards and a witch had been in the lift. They'd bailed out the instant they saw Amelia's expression.</p>
<p>"If they know what's good for them, they will," Amelia grumbled. She sighed a moment later, going from furious to exhausted. "I don't know. They do nothing without expectations of something in return and I'm not sure that I have anything that would entice them enough."</p>
<p>Anthony nodded slowly. They'd decided early on to keep the knowledge of Voldemort's horcruxes as secret as possible. It was 'shards' and 'magical impressions' and 'soul leeches' every time anyone mentioned it. Amelia, in particular, had been mentioned as someone not to tell because it would cause a huge conflict of interest for her. She couldn't go haring off after the people who'd helped create the horcruxes, not when Lucius was one of them. And not when it'd just get her killed.</p>
<p>"I have something that would work," Anthony said. The lift stopped but Anthony held the 'close door' button firmly so that they wouldn't be interrupted. "I'm going to have to tell them secretly. It would… It would probably get you assassinated if you knew it and frankly? I'd rather have you become Minister for Magic instead of going to your funeral."</p>
<p>Amelia choked and went blazingly purple-red. "You say that outside the lift and I'll arrest you myself! I've no interest at all in being Minister. Horrible job."</p>
<p>"Granted," Anthony agreed as he let the door open finally. "But you have to admit, you could do a lot of good in the position. Better than any of the other candidates."</p>
<p>She glared at him like she wanted to strip the skin and flesh from his bones. Anthony grinned at her and waved for her to take the lead. The Department of Mysteries was dark, few torches at all, and seemed to be carved out of raw rock. Ridiculous given their location. Someone had invested a great deal of money and time into making it look like carved chambers when it was just more basement under the Ministry.</p>
<p>The Director of the Department of Mysteries, Croaker, wore a hood that obscured their identity completely, just like the rest of the staff. Despite the hood that hid eyes, mouth, voice, even gender, Anthony was completely certain that Croaker was studying him like he was a butterfly about to be put into a kill jar and then pinned out for study.</p>
<p>Still not as impressive as Petunia rolling her eyes at you for being an idiot.</p>
<p>"I will not sign anything," Croaker said before Amelia even opened her mouth. "Fudge has made it clear that Black is to remain where he is. So had that spangled meddler, Dumbledore."</p>
<p>"Nice to see that Dumbledore still owns Fudge," Anthony drawled. He waved at Amelia when she bristled at him. "Right, then. I've got an offer for you. I'll tell you something very significant and very secret about Voldemort in exchange for getting Sirius out of Azkaban and letting us escort him away, untouched and unspelled."</p>
<p>Anthony had the distinct impression that Croaker raised an eyebrow. They certainly leaned back in their chair, hands loosely folded together on their desk in a pose that was too stiff for true casualness.</p>
<p>"Really?" Croaker asked.</p>
<p>"Yes," Anthony said. "Madame Bones can't hear it. It'll get her assassinated. I can tell you that I learned it from Harry Potter, not that he knew or knows what it was he gave us."</p>
<p>That rocked Amelia back on her heels and Croaker so far back in their chair that it creaked dramatically. Something shifted against the wall. A shadow slipped away from the wall and resolved into one of the Unspeakables.</p>
<p>"Shall I cast a privacy spell, sir?" the Unspeakable asked.</p>
<p>"Put one on yourself and Madame Bones," Croaker said. "I'll spell myself and Mr. Black with several layers of protection."</p>
<p>Anthony waited as that happened. No surprise, Amelia looked really, violently unhappy about it until the privacy spell shrouded them in a shimmery veil. Croaker's three layers of privacy spells, two wards against listening spells, five against hidden animagus and one that simply created a dark bell overtop of the two of them and their desk were smooth, quick and so powerful that it made the hair stand up on Anthony's arms.</p>
<p>"I hope you're right about the worth of this," Croaker said. They sounded quite unimpressed but their hands were rigid inside of their black gloves.</p>
<p>"Voldemort created horcruxes," Anthony said. "Six of them. The final one was lodged in Harry Potter's scar and it wasn't a proper horcrux. When he tried to kill Harry, something went very wrong. Lily and James were prepared for him though I don't really understand the ritual they'd set up in Harry's nursery. The goblins are gathering all the horcruxes and we will be destroying Voldemort in ritual at the bank by Halloween."</p>
<p>"That's… definitely worth Sirius Black's freedom," Croaker said, visibly shaking.</p>
<p>"Oh, the really big part is that Dumbledore knew all along what Voldemort had done," Anthony said with a grim smile that hurt his face. It turned into a snarl. "He knew and he left the shard in Harry's scar. He knew and he ensured that Harry and his family were cursed to treat him horribly. He knew and he set Harry up to become the next Dark Lord after Voldemort was defeated, probably by either Harry or Dumbledore."</p>
<p>Croaker stood. Their spells fell and then the privacy spell around Amelia and the Unspeakable fell, too.</p>
<p>"You will have every bit of help we can give you," Croaker said. "Let's get Sirius Black out of Azkaban."</p>
<p>"Thank you," Anthony said. He grinned when Amelia ground her teeth and glared at him. "Just remember, you're better off alive than dead."</p>
<p>Croaker laughed, making both Amelia and the Unspeakable start. "That's certainly true. You'll have protective charms before you leave, both of you. I won't have you killed 'accidentally' before this is dealt with."</p>
<p>They strode off out of their office, leaving everyone else to scramble to keep up. The Black family magic purred inside of Anthony, utterly pleased at more allies for Harry, more allies for all of them. This what they'd needed, badly. Someone with the knowledge and skill to help them save Sirius and who could protect them all against Dumbledore's manipulation.</p>
<p>Soon, they'd have Sirius and they'd be one step closer to taking Dumbledore down for good. Anthony had no doubt who the real threat in magical Britain was.</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>Of all the places Harry had seen after he got his letter, Black Castle was the first that really felt like home. Not necessarily where he wanted to live but a place that he belonged. The wards shivered happily when Anthony apparated in with Harry and Dudley. They didn't respond at all when Remus arrived with Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon.</p>
<p>Itzy had gotten the Castle cleaned up so well that Harry wouldn't have thought that it'd been uninhabited for years. Everything was clean and fresh. The curtains had no dust. The windows sparkled they were so clear. The elves had put fresh-cut roses in vases in every room, so the Castle smelled wonderful.</p>
<p>None of which made it any easier for Harry to wait patiently for Sirius to arrive. Aunt Petunia had flatly refused to allow Harry or Dudley to have any part in saving Sirius. They were too young, too untrained and it would expose Harry far before they were ready.</p>
<p>Even if tomorrow was the will reading when everything was going to change.</p>
<p>The last week had been absolute chaos. Aunt Marge's lessons had finally moved on from history and breeding and bloodlines into proper behavior at various levels of society, politics and the framework of power that went along with being a duke.</p>
<p>Harry'd kind of forgotten that he still had the whole muggle duke thing to deal with in all the other stuff he'd had to learn. Aunt Marge had reminded him in no uncertain terms and set him six assignments, all essays, that he was to complete and mail to her while he was off at school. They were to be done before the Christmas holidays or there'd be hell to pay.</p>
<p>If Harry had his choice, he would have ignored them all to the last minute, but he'd actually read the questions, gone to his books and realized that he needed to do a lot of studying to be able to even try to answer them. </p>
<p>Darn Aunt Marge for giving him relevant, useful essays to write. He'd rather spend his time learning magic and figuring out the history of house elves. And playing Quidditch with Draco and Dudley. Learning magical plants with Neville and law with Susan. Harry sighed. He was going to be very lucky if he managed to finish even two of the essays in time. There was just so much stuff to learn.</p>
<p>"Mum, when's he getting here?" Dudley asked from his spot on the big black leather couch. He had his feet up in the air, his hair brushing the floor and his arms sprawled out like he always did if he could get away with it.</p>
<p>"If I knew, I'd tell you," Aunt Petunia snapped.</p>
<p>Harry straightened up. Dudley rolled back upright. Uncle Vernon swallowed and hesitantly rubbed his hand over Aunt Petunia's shoulder blades. They all knew that tone of voice. None of them wanted to be the one getting dressed down.</p>
<p>The fireplace flared up with brilliant green flames.</p>
<p>"Finally!" Harry exclaimed.</p>
<p>Remus stumbled out supporting a very thin, very dirty man with ragged clothes, black hair and a wild expression on his face. Anthony came out right behind him with Madame Bones on his heels.</p>
<p>Harry's heart just about leaped straight out his throat. He knew this man. Something deep inside of him knew Sirius. </p>
<p>Not just the family magic which surged and rejoiced, raged and slammed the wards tight around the Castle. </p>
<p>Harry. </p>
<p>He knew Sirius.</p>
<p>"Padfoot?" Harry asked.</p>
<p>Both Remus and Sirius froze. When Sirius lifted his head, Harry gasped because yes. Yes, he knew those eyes. No matter how filthy Sirius was, Harry knew those silver eyes.</p>
<p>"Harry?"</p>
<p>"You're here!" Harry exclaimed. He ran over only to skid to a stop just outside of touching range. "Wow, you stink. You really need a bath."</p>
<p>Remus huffed but Sirius made a little squeak of a laugh as the corners of his eyes wrinkled dramatically. Dudley came over and choked, waving a hand in front of his face while grinning at Sirius.</p>
<p>"That's terrible!" Dudley exclaimed with so much awe that Aunt Petunia put her head in hands. "You smell worse than the trash behind our school on a hot day when they served creamed spinach."</p>
<p>Sirius started laughing, rusty and terrible, but he stood a little taller, so it was okay. Harry braced himself, visibly since it seemed to make Sirius happy to joke about how filthy he was and caught Sirius' free hand.</p>
<p>"Come on," Harry said. "We'll get the elves to run you a bath. Maybe three or four baths. Those clothes are getting tossed. Did they not give you anything to wear at that place?"</p>
<p>Remus sighed as he helped Sirius follow Harry's tug. "Azkaban doesn't give its residents anything but food once a day and a toilet, Harry."</p>
<p>Harry stopped in his tracks, turning to glare at Anthony. "We're fixing that, too. Put it on the list."</p>
<p>"Yes!" Anthony shouted, punching the air. "Finally! Lacey's going to be so glad."</p>
<p>Harry grinned at him. "I don't know if anyone told you, but that's Anthony Black. He's your cousin. His father was Marius who got disowned and kicked out for being a squib. He and his sisters, plus his wife and her sisters, are part of the family now. I know there's others I need to find and bring back, but it was more important to save you."</p>
<p>He and Remus got Sirius to the suite that was going to be his, into a bathtub full of steaming water and scrubbed. Very, very thoroughly scrubbed. Remus cast a spell first, but it didn't get rid of all the stink, so Sirius used a bunch of soap and Harry helped him wash all the matts and knots and grunge out of his hair.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the tub was spelled to keep the water clean no matter how filthy you were. Otherwise Sirius would've been bathing in brown water very quickly.</p>
<p>He was painfully thin. There were bite marks on his arms like a dog had gone after him. Every time Harry stopped talking about the things he was learning or how grubby Sirius was or even just how glad he was to have met the elves and how amazing it was that they cleaned the family magic while doing stuff, Sirius got a hunted look.</p>
<p>"This is real," Sirius said once he was dried off, dressed in nice soft, warm pajamas with thick socks on his feet and a robe over top.</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said. "It is. There's so much more but not much time to explain it. I go off to Hogwarts tomorrow. We had to be careful about saving you."</p>
<p>He held Sirius' hand and let the Black and Potter magic swirl into him. Or, more accurately, Harry tried to let the magic connect to Sirius. Something blocked him, blocked the magic. Harry gasped and turned to Remus who frowned.</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" Remus asked.</p>
<p>"The magic's blocked!" Harry exclaimed. "He can't feel the family magic at all, Remus. We need to get the blocks off Sirius just like you had to get them off me."</p>
<p>"Wait, what blocks?" Sirius demanded with much more fire than before. "Who put blocks on you? James and Lily absolutely refused to put blocks on your magic!"</p>
<p>"I'm getting the healer," Remus said. He wagged a finger at the two of them. "Don't do anything. Not a single thing. You don't know what you might stir up. Remember what I had to go through, Harry."</p>
<p>"Hurry," Harry told him. "The magic isn't going to wait very long."</p>
<p>"Remus had blocks on him?" Sirius asked, trying to get up and then flopping back down to his bed again. "What the bloody hell has been going on while I was in there?"</p>
<p>"I don't know all of it," Harry said, still trying to push magic into Sirius because it needed to be done. He needed Sirius. Sirius needed Harry. The magic needed both of them and it had to happen right now. "But Dumbledore is behind it. I don't know why. I don't know what. But he's behind it all and someone's got to stop him, Sirius. He's hurting so many people all over the place."</p>
<p>Sirius stared at Harry as if he'd gone mad but as the Black magic thickened around them, the room began to shake. The Potter magic surged out through Harry's hands into Sirius', lighting him up green as it tried to cut through whatever had been done to Sirius.</p>
<p>"Kreacher," Harry said, bowing his head. "Itzy, Bitsy, Zing, Lenny, Crow! I need you. Sirius needs you."</p>
<p>Six pops sounded around Sirius' bed. Kreacher frowned and then gasped when he saw Sirius. All six elves popped up onto the bed and put their hands on Sirius, but Kreacher was the one who reached out to cup Sirius' cheek.</p>
<p>"Master Sirius was tortured," Kreacher said slow and furious. "Master Sirius was hurt worse than Kreacher. Kreacher did not realize, could not feel Master Sirius. Thought Master Sirius had rejected Kreacher."</p>
<p>"This… you're Kreacher?" Sirius whispered. "But you're so different."</p>
<p>"Healthy now," Kreacher said, nodding.  "Master Sirius has been trapped and hurt for too long. No longer."</p>
<p>It was so much like saving Lucius but instead of everyone working to reject something that'd been engraved on his body, it was Harry and the elves and then Aunt Petunia and Dudley and Anthony and Lacey who'd gotten there sometime, and their sisters even though they weren't at the Castle, all of them together pushing magic into Harry behind the wedge the Potter family magic had created.</p>
<p>Harry breathed in and then out. He nodded.</p>
<p>Kreacher hammered his magic into the back of the Potter wedge. Sirius gasped, swaying even with the other elves supporting him. Kreacher hit again, again, and then the block cracked. The Black family magic roared as it surged into Sirius, lighting him up from the inside out.</p>
<p>Harry hung on even as people shouted for him to let go, to pull back, to be safe.</p>
<p>As fast as it started, the magic subsided in a wash around the room. It was like a puddle of mercury instead of the blue of the Malfoy magic. As soon as the magic flowed properly through Sirius, he collapsed back against the pillows, panting. Harry flopped on his chest with a groan.</p>
<p>"Didn't I say don't do anything?" Remus said with a tired sigh.</p>
<p>Sirius started laughing. He hugged Harry and then turned to look at Kreacher who patted his hair before disappearing. The other elves gave Sirius a pat as well, little Crow grinning at Sirius with delight before she popped out.</p>
<p>"Remus?" Sirius asked. His voice sounded a little thin, a lot exhausted, but he didn't let Harry go.</p>
<p>"Yeah, Padfoot?" Remus asked.</p>
<p>"First, thank you," Sirius said. "I can't… thank you."</p>
<p>Remus laughed his ghost of a laugh. "You're welcome, Padfoot."</p>
<p>"Second, Amelia?"</p>
<p>"Black," Amelia said but she sounded a little stuffed up like she might have been crying. She even sniffled which Harry wanted to see but opening his eyes was just too much work right now.</p>
<p>"I'm going to need protection, continuous protection," Sirius said. "There's… Harry broke through a bunch of memory blocks. It's much bigger than you think."</p>
<p>"Done," Amelia said.</p>
<p>"Finally, Petunia?"</p>
<p>Harry did pry his eyes open then. Aunt Petunia was standing right next to the bed, one hand on Sirius' arm. She looked stern and worried, but her back was very straight and her lips weren't pressed together. Dudley was right behind her with Uncle Vernon looming behind him. All three of them kept glancing at Harry. He gave it another minute before Dudley climbed on the bed to hug Harry and make sure he was all right.</p>
<p>"Harry can't go to Hogwarts without protection," Sirius said so grimly that Harry managed to look at him, too. "You can't, Prongslet. Dumbledore will spell and potion you into oblivion if you do."</p>
<p>Harry grinned. "I already took care of that. We should have the protection amulets tonight. Everyone's getting them. Absolutely everyone."</p>
<p>Sirius blinked and then frowned at them all. He finally turned to Aunt Petunia who lifted her chin to glare at him as if daring him to get up from the bed.</p>
<p>"Tell me everything I've missed. I need to know it all."</p>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p>There were easily twenty-thousand things that needed to be done before the students arrived. Minerva's To Do list was twenty inches long and only growing as she found item after item that Albus had breezily promised was under control, only to discover now that no, it most certainly was not.</p>
<p>The children's bedrooms were not prepared. The linens hadn't been properly aired over the summer. Minerva couldn't yell at the poor beleaguered elves. They'd been ordered outright by Albus to leave it until the last minute. Floors unswept, books unshelved, food barely begun to be prepared for the feast that would happen in just a few hours.</p>
<p>"I swear," Minerva snarled as she stomped from the kitchen towards her office, "that man does less and less every single year. If this keeps up, I'll be doing the entire job myself. Both of them!"</p>
<p>"Goodness."</p>
<p>Minerva started and turned to find Filius staring up at her with concern. She sighed and waved away his unvoiced concern. He'd managed to get away from Hogwarts over the summer, visiting relatives among the goblins for a good month. Since the start of August, actually. If he'd been here, more than likely most of the too-many items on her list would have been quietly taken care of. Filius had always been helpful when Minerva was overwhelmed.</p>
<p>"I do hope that's not all things that need to be done yet," Filius said. He tweaked the list out of Minerva's control with a deft display of his mastery. "Oh. Oh my. My word. What has Albus been doing?"</p>
<p>"I wish I knew," Minerva complained as she started back towards her office with Filius and the auto-quill following along behind her, still making notes on things that needed to be done right away.</p>
<p>"My word, well, we'll have to enlist everyone to get this done," Filius said. He shook his head and passed the list back to Minerva with a sympathetic smile. "Best break out your best brandy for after the feast. I suspect you'll need it."</p>
<p>Laughter startled Minerva and broke loose. "I should! You shouldn't give me ideas, Filius. Albus isn't even here for me to yell at. If I break out the brandy, I'll spend the whole night tearing him up one side and down the other. Damn the man, anyway."</p>
<p>It felt disloyal to think such things about Albus. He was a very busy man, what with all his titles, but she couldn't help it. Not when she had an entire summer's worth of work to be done in six hours.</p>
<p>Filius stared at Minerva for a long moment, rocking on his toes. "We'll all help. It will get done. Have you been checked out lately, Minerva? I saw Quirrell on my way in. That was why I was looking for you, actually. He's lost so much weight, stones of it, over the summer. Hardly looks the same man. And that stammer!"</p>
<p>Minerva sighed and sat at her desk. "I haven't had the time, no. Too many things going on, I'm afraid, though yes, I have seen Quirrell. He does look dreadful but Albus assured me that he would be fine. I'm not so sure. I can smell just a faint hint of rot around him. I'm going to have to get Poppy to check him out after the students arrive. I think he must have been bitten by something and it got infected."</p>
<p>Both of Filius' eyebrows went up. "I'm astonished you could smell anything but garlic. The poor man seems to be bathing in it now."</p>
<p>Minerva nodded. The changes to Quirrell were… horrifying, honestly. He'd always been a powerful magic user, and one who focused on his physical development at the same time as his magical prowess. Something over the summer had transformed him from the bold, gentle, determined man he'd been into a stammering wreck with ticks, terrors and completely ruined health.</p>
<p>"I'll talk to him after the children are settled," Minerva said. "Do you suppose you can muster everyone? We'll need to work together to get everything ready. The elves can't handle it all."</p>
<p>They should have been able to. If they were properly fed, properly cared for, they would have had the castle in tip-top shape ages ago. They would have kept it in shape. But Albus had insisted that they be given lighter duties over the summer and the effect on them couldn't be clearer. Poor things.</p>
<p>"Of course," Filius said. "I'll just call everyone together in the Great Hall. We can talk, divide the duties up and get it all wrapped up before the Feast. Do you know when Albus will return? Or what he's gone off to do?"</p>
<p>Filius' eyes sparkled with curiosity as he asked. If Minerva hadn't known better, she would have thought that it was the sole reason that Filius sought her out. Nonsense, though. Filius was one of the best professors for helping the students and the teachers. He wouldn't have visited just to pump her for information.</p>
<p>In addition to other things, certainly, but not just for that.</p>
<p>"I've no idea," Minerva huffed and shook her head. "He just breezed off through the floo, declaring that he had an important errand in London to take care of. He was gone before I could even ask him what it was for or why he'd leave just before the students arrived."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm sure it was important," Filius said with a little shake of his head that implied that he didn't think it could possibly be that important. "Come. Let's get the castle polished up. It's always such fun to see the first years' expressions as they come in."</p>
<p>Minerva laughed and heaved herself back to her feet. "It really is. That's one of my favorite parts of the new school year."</p>
<p>They shared a smile and then headed off to get Hogwarts ready for the year. Wherever Albus had gone off to, it must have been important though Minerva would always believe that the school was far more important. Shaping young hearts and educating young minds was the most important thing anyone could do.</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>Silverclaw met them when they came through the floo to the bank lobby. He looked furious, lip curled up to expose his sharp teeth and claws tapping against each other as if he was counting coins. Or maybe getting ready to use those claws to tear someone to shreds.</p>
<p>"We have little time, Mr. Potter," Silverclaw declared as he waved for Harry, Sirius, Remus, Anthony and Aunt Petunia to follow him. "Dumbledore is aware of you and your guardians' actions. He will be here shortly to attempt to seal the will before we can read it."</p>
<p>"Can he do that?" Harry asked, running next to Silverclaw who walked as fast as Uncle Vernon when he was on his way onto the rugby pitch.</p>
<p>"Legally, no," Silverclaw said. He snorted. "But Dumbledore has rarely concerned himself with legalities."</p>
<p>"You do have your protective amulet, don't you?" Harry asked Silverclaw. "We all have ours. We got them last night and put them on right away. I don't want you or any of the goblins hurt during this."</p>
<p>Silverclaw smiled, tight and fond, at Harry as Mr. Swashlin joined their group at a run, a folio of paperwork clutched to his chest. </p>
<p>"We have our own methods of protecting our minds and souls, Mr. Potter. You need not worry. No wizard will compromise us ever again, not even Dumbledore."</p>
<p>The room for the will reading was rough-hewn, the walls so raw that bits of gravel and sand lay strewn in the corners of the room. The table was equally new. It was made of a brand new, unpolished slab of granite set on heavy granite legs that were just raw chunks of rock sheared flat on either end. Their chairs were stone, too, with the only concession to comfort being the shaping worked into the seat.</p>
<p>A new room, new furniture, nothing that had ever been touched by a wizard's hand or magic before. Harry bit his lip and edged closer to Aunt Petunia. He'd read the chapter about insults and warnings. This room shouted that there was no trust between the goblins and the people attending the will reading.</p>
<p>Or that they were taking every precaution to ensure that no influence could affect them all before the reading began.</p>
<p>"Um, can we seal the room with wards that make sure that no one can cast spells, Silverclaw?" Harry asked as the door opened and a very old, very brightly dressed wizard swept in.</p>
<p>That had to be Dumbledore. He was very tall and very old, with a long white beard that he must spend a huge amount of time tending to. It was far too clean and perfectly combed for him not to take great care of it. His robes were like something out of Disney, bright and shimmery with gold stars and silver comets set against a purple background. Even his hat was shiny purple with a long peak that bent just so at the tip.</p>
<p>For a second, Harry wondered wildly how much time Dumbledore had spent getting the tip to bend exactly like that because there was no way that it'd happened naturally.</p>
<p>"Oh, I hardly think that's necessary," Dumbledore said breezily while smiling at Harry as if he was desperately fond of Harry.</p>
<p>The amulet around Harry's neck vibrated and warmed. Harry didn't clutch at it. Doing so would only reveal it and he really didn't want to risk Dumbledore attacking his best method of protecting his mind and everyone else's when they'd only just met.</p>
<p>"I'll pay extra for it," Harry said while pressing against Aunt Petunia's side. "With a bonus for everyone involved in the will reading of three silvers each."</p>
<p>"Done," Silverclaw said. He glared at Dumbledore who opened his mouth "It is done, wizard. You were not invited to this will reading. Leave now."</p>
<p>"Why, I have no intention of interfering," Dumbledore said. Both his eyebrows went up like the was trying to project pure innocence only for him to freeze and stare as Silverclaw's magic swept over the room.</p>
<p>The twinkle left Dumbledore's eyes. So did the sparkle of his purple robe and hat. The stars and comets stopped moving. But that wasn't the most disturbing part. </p>
<p>Everything genial and kind disappeared from Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Now his eyes were a hard black that felt like they could cut you in half. His beard was still perfectly white and perfectly groomed, but his expression was scary instead of grandfatherly. In fact, Dumbledore looked furious and all of that fury was pointed squarely at Harry.</p>
<p>"Read the will," Aunt Petunia said to Mr. Swashlin. She turned to Dumbledore with her most ferocious glare, one almost as fierce as Dumbledore's. "You. You can stand by the door if you must, but you're not to sit at the table, to touch any of us or to speak. If you do, I'll pay the goblins to have you executed for disrupting the operations of the bank."</p>
<p>"Ooh, can you do that?" Harry asked Aunt Petunia. "I haven't gotten to the chapter on penalties in the second book yet."</p>
<p>"I started there," Aunt Petunia said with a fond little quirk of her lips at Harry. "Yes, you can. And I will. Lily's vault has more than enough money to pay the penalties and fees. And I already know that in this bank Goblin law holds, not wizarding or British law. So be quiet, stand still and don't interrupt."</p>
<p>Dumbledore huffed. When Harry glanced back at him, the glare had gone up several notches. He was looking at each of them as if he was memorizing every single detail of them so that he could destroy them later, one by one.</p>
<p>"Not one word," Aunt Petunia snapped at Dumbledore when he opened his mouth. "Triple the normal fee, Silverclaw."</p>
<p>"Done," Silverclaw agreed with such silky anticipation that Dumbledore snapped his mouth shut with an audible click.</p>
<p>"Very good," Mr. Swashlin said, gesturing for them all to take their places around the table. "James and Lily had few bequests in their will. They specified that Harry was to go to Sirius first, then Frank and Alice Longbottom if he was unavailable, and then to you, Mrs. Dursley, as the third option. They arranged for a very nice sum to be paid to you for Harry's education and keep, none of which was delivered to you despite it being disbursed properly. We are, currently, auditing to find out where the money went."</p>
<p>He glared at Dumbledore for that, as did Silverclaw. Dumbledore smiled back at them. Probably, Dumbledore meant it to be a kindly and beatific smile, like a genial old saint, but it came out as angry and snarling instead without his twinkly eyes thing. That had to be a spell. Harry was going to have to spend the entire train ride up to Hogwarts figuring out what sort of magic that was and how he could counter it. There had to be a way.</p>
<p>Mr. Swashlin read through a bunch of legal stuff about sound mind and body, before sighing and nodding to Remus. "For our dear friend Remus, we leave a trust vault of a quarter of a million galleons. We know that you'll resent it and complain bitterly, Moony, but you deserve to be happy and to buy all the books you want."</p>
<p>Remus's breath caught. Sirius caught his hand and squeezed so hard that both their knuckles went white.</p>
<p>"To our dear friend Sirius, second father to our little Harry," Mr. Swashlin continued without looking up from the will, "we leave Harry, control over the Gryffindor votes in the Wizengamot until Harry reaches his majority, and orders to ensure that Harry is raised knowing everything about his families. Both of them, Muggle and Magical. You don't need money, but you do get my library of prank books, Sirius. Use them with joy."</p>
<p>"I've got that," Harry told Sirius as he leaned into Sirius' side. "I'll give it to you after we're done here."</p>
<p>"Thanks, Prongslet," Sirius said, sniffling loudly. "Keep it for now. You might need it at school."</p>
<p>"To Petunia and Vernon," Mr. Swashlin said just a little louder so that he could be heard over Sirius' snuffling and tiny keening noises, "we leave Lily's vault, her investments and an apology. We always meant to tell you about James' position, but what with the prophecy and Dumbledore's interference, we never had the chance. We're both very sorry about that, but Lily wanted to make sure you knew that she was an idiot and a liar and she never stopped loving you. Make sure Harry gets all his positions, Petunia. We trust that you'll set both the Parliament and the Wizengamot on their ears. If you have to, get Vernon's horrible sister Marge involved. She'll cow anyone into submission."</p>
<p>"Oh, damn her," Petunia said. She took a hankie from her purse and pressed it against her mouth. "After all these years, she apologizes properly."</p>
<p>Tears hung in her eyes, but they didn't fall. Instead, Aunt Petunia sniffled once, swallowed and then nodded to Mr. Swashlin.</p>
<p>"There's no specific bequest for you, Mr. Potter," Mr. Swashlin said as he pulled out a letter. He passed it to Harry. "James and Lily only asked that I deliver this to you and that I make sure that your accounts always balanced. Silverclaw and I will ensure that they do from now on."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Mr. Swashlin," Harry said. He clutched the letter to his chest. "Is there anything else?"</p>
<p>"Only a bit more legal talk," Mr. Swashlin said. </p>
<p>He smiled rather sadly as he continued reading through a bunch more legal stuff that boiled down to Aunt Petunia and Sirius being in charge of taking care of Harry. There were three more places that said that Sirius was in charge of making sure Harry's votes in the Wizengamot were well-handled and four more that emphasized that he had votes in Parliament, too. Lily added a bit at the very, very end of the will stating that if Sirius didn't take up his position and knock the Wizengamot on its ear, she'd come back and haunt him until he did.</p>
<p>Sirius finally burst into tears at that, clinging to Remus who rubbed his back and comforted him while glaring at Dumbledore with glowing, golden eyes.</p>
<p>Every single time the Wizengamot came up through the whole will reading, Dumbledore had shifted position and grumbled. He never said anything. In fact, once the will was officially pronounced read and the wards were opened so that they could leave, Dumbledore glared at Harry once before spinning and flouncing out of the room. The sparkle came back to his robes and the strangely compelling air of kindly grandfather came back, too, not that Harry was ever going to believe it again.</p>
<p>Silverclaw sealed the wards again as soon as Dumbledore was gone.</p>
<p>This time, Harry recognized the purification and curse breaking spells. He'd been through them in his books enough times to recognize them. Silverclaw nodded and then started cursing in Gobbledygook while pacing at the far side of the room.</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" Harry asked once Silverclaw stopped cursing. "Did he put spells on us?"</p>
<p>"No, Mr. Potter, he did not," Silverclaw said. "But he knows that his plans have been disrupted and I do not like that you will be in his sphere of power. Alone."</p>
<p>"But I won't be alone," Harry said. "I have Draco and Neville and Susan on my side. Plus anyone else that I can get to on the train. That's why I wanted so many extra charms, you see. So that I can protect everyone that I decide that I can trust."</p>
<p>"It still bothers me," Silverclaw said, tapping his claws against the raw stone table.</p>
<p>"Understandably," Aunt Petunia said. She shook her head as if she wanted to keep Harry home, too, but nodded towards the letter still clutched to Harry's chest. "Do you want to open your letter now, Harry?"</p>
<p>"Um, I probably should," Harry said even though he really wanted to read it while he was alone just in case it was something mushy and loving from his parents that would make him cry as hard as Sirius who was leaning into Remus' side like he would never, ever be able to sit up on his own again.</p>
<p>"You don't have to," Aunt Petunia said.</p>
<p>"I know," Harry said. "But, well, it might be something important that you guys need to know. Better to know now so that you can work on fixing whatever it is than not."</p>
<p>He unsealed the envelope, taking care not to tear it, and pulled out a single sheet of parchment. The handwriting was very neat, very precise. His mother's writing. He'd seen it in some of her books where she'd written in the margins.</p>
<p>Harry started reading out loud, keeping his eyes on the letter so that he didn't have to watch the grownups react to it.</p>
<p>'Dear Harry,</p>
<p>James thinks I'm a bit daft to write to you this way, but I have no faith in Dumbledore's stupid plan. He was the one who told us of the prophecy. He was the one to insist that we had to hide away with you. And he was the one to convinced James that a simple fidelus with no wards or traps or even a portkey would be enough to keep us safe.</p>
<p>Dumbledore claims that there's a prophecy that states that you are destined to defeat the Dark Lord. I think it's a lot of rubbish, but James has a bit more faith in prophecy than I do. This is what the prophecy says:</p>
<p>"The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches... born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies... and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not... and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives... the one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord will be born as the seventh month dies...."</p>
<p>I'd have researched it mercilessly if I could, but Dumbledore gave us no chance to do anything of the sort. Bear in mind that prophecies are notoriously hard to interpret. Do not take it literally and do not take chances. Be careful, darling, and always know that we love you more than anything in the world.</p>
<p>Your loving mother,</p>
<p>Lily Potter'</p>
<p>Harry was fine until the last two lines. Then tears welled up and he gulped, passing the letter to Aunt Petunia who frowned as she read it over. Sirius pulled Harry into a hug that rocked them both side to side. It didn't help much. Sirius was far too bony for a proper hug. But it was better than no hugs and the Black magic soothed both Harry and the Potter magic, so it was much better than nothing.</p>
<p>"Hm," Aunt Petunia said. "I wonder who this Dark Lord is, really."</p>
<p>Dead silence.</p>
<p>Harry sniffled and turned to Aunt Petunia who was tapping the envelope against her bottom lip while staring into the distance. He took the letter and read the prophecy over again. It didn't say You-Know-Who or any of the other silly names that people gave Voldemort. It just said Dark Lord.</p>
<p>"Dumbledore is kind of dark," Harry said.</p>
<p>"That was my thought," Aunt Petunia said. She passed the envelope back to Harry who carefully tucked the letter away again. "Well, we'd best be getting you off to the train. I think we've got a good bit of work to do once you're gone."</p>
<p>"Yeah," Harry said. He rubbed his eyes with the back of his hand and swallowed down the urge to cry some more. "I think I do, too. I gotta get as many allies as I can. Dumbledore wanted me to be isolated. Ignorant. Desperate for anything he gave me. I bet… I bet that was what the prophecy was talking about. The power he knows not: true loyalty and affection. Or maybe the way family magic is sort-of alive? That could be it, too."</p>
<p>Sirius and Remus stared at Harry and Aunt Petunia as if they'd both gone mad. Mr. Swashlin looked equally dumbfounded but Silverclaw smiled his tight, hard smile that was like a knife at your throat.</p>
<p>"I believe you may be right, Mr. Potter, Mrs. Dursley," Silverclaw said. "We'd best hurry if we're to get you to the platform on time, Mr. Potter. There's not much time to spare before the train leaves. You'll have to apparate to the platform."</p>
<p>"I'll take him," Mr. Swashlin announced. "I'll be right back so that we can discuss all of this."</p>
<p>Harry stood and gave Aunt Petunia a hug that she sighed over even as she tried to smooth his messy hair. Sirius' hug messed his hair right back up at the same time that it pulled him off his feet and into Sirius' lap. Remus' hug was comforting and warm and wonderful. Then Harry hurried with Mr. Swashlin for the lobby so that he could head off on his first trip to Hogwarts.</p>
<p>Alone.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Minera started when the fireplace in the Great Hall flared green. It rarely connected with the floo network. Only Albus had the power to do it, in fact. They'd only just managed to get the tasks portioned out so Albus hadn't actually been gone that long.</p>
<p>When he emerged from the floo, scowling like a thunderstorm, Minerva had a moment where she wished that he'd stayed away for hours instead.</p>
<p>"Hagrid!" Dumbledore snapped so harshly that Minerva flinched along with Hagrid. </p>
<p>To her surprise, Filius edged closer to her and Hagrid, his hand resting lightly on the wand holster strapped to his hip. Given his size, a hip holster was a better choice than an arm one.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir?" Hagrid asked. He fussed with his beard and fidgeted exactly as a mountain of a man never should.</p>
<p>"What exactly did you do when you escorted Harry Potter to Diagon Alley?" Albus demanded.</p>
<p>"Just what you told me to do, P'fessor," Hagrid said much more nervously when Albus scowled at him. "Took 'im to the bank and got his money. Then we got 'im clothes and books and an owl. Sent him home on the train just as you suggested."</p>
<p>"Wait, you sent Hagrid to help Harry Potter get his school supplies?" Minerva said once she realized that yes, she actually was hearing this. "Albus! It should have been one of us! Hagrid, I mean no offense, but there's a whole series of questions you couldn't answer. Not to mention to difficulty for you getting him there and back again. What in the world were you thinking?"</p>
<p>She asked Albus the last bit, not that it did her a bit of good. Albus just waved a hand at her, eyes twinkling, before he strode out of the Great Hall and left them all standing their open-mouthed. Minerva strangled the need to scream, sucking a breath in and then letting it out slowly between her clenched teeth.</p>
<p>"I jus' did what he said to do," Hagrid offered while tears hovered in his eyes. "Harry seemed to be jus' fine. Got him a beautiful snowy owl, too."</p>
<p>"Oh, Hagrid," Minerva said as she patted his huge hand. "It's fine. I'm sure Albus has his reasons for being upset or concerned. Not that they matter right now. We've only got a few hours to get the school fully ready. Let's get to work and later, after the feast, I'll corner Albus to find out just what's bothering him."</p>
<p>It wasn't what she wanted to do. Not even close. But if Albus wasn't going to properly lead the school, then someone else would have to. Given that Minerva was the Deputy Headmistress, sadly, it fell to her to make it all happen.</p>
<p>Though she really was going to give him a piece of her mind once the children were settled in. A very loud, very long piece of her mind.</p>
<p>++</p>
<p>Surprisingly, the more often you went through the floo, the easier it got. Harry barely stumbled when they were ejected out of the floo on the platform 9 3/4. Granted, that was because he'd clung to Mr. Swashlin's hand as if he was a lifeline and gone through it as stiffly as if all his bones had been replaced with steel, but it worked.</p>
<p>Mr. Swashlin waved his wand and all the soot billowed away into nothingness. Once that was gone, Harry looked around the platform and boggled.</p>
<p>A steam engine. The Hogwarts Express was a steam engine. He'd never even seen a steam engine before outside of movies and the telly. If anyone had asked him before now, he'd have said that there weren't any steam engines left on the isles.</p>
<p>"You'll want to get a carriage towards the head of the train," Mr. Swashlin said. "They're the most popular because you can get off the train and on towards Hogwarts more quickly. It's the best place to meet people and make friends."</p>
<p>"Front of the train," Harry agreed as he stared at all the families crying and hugging and laughing as they said goodbye. "And why can't Aunt Petunia come again?"</p>
<p>Mr. Swashlin chuckled. "Oh, mostly because she's plotting to sue, I imagine."</p>
<p>That caught Harry's funny bone and he snickered. Aunt Petunia probably was planning on suing Dumbledore. He didn't know if she had the slightest chance of succeeding. He hoped she did. Maybe it would keep Dumbledore away from Harry, not that he expected it.</p>
<p>"You have your trunk?" Mr. Swashlin asked.</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said. "Hedwig's flying there now. I sent her before I left for the bank. I've got her perch, my things, all three of my library trunks and Dudley insisted on packing me sandwiches for the trip."</p>
<p>"There is a treats trolley," Mr. Swashlin said with a smile that wrinkled his face up dramatically. "But it's almost all candy so that's not a bad idea."</p>
<p>He put his hands on Harry's shoulders and with a start Harry realized that they looked like father and son. Their features weren't that similar but with their hair and dark skin, most everyone on the platform was looking right past them. Harry's heart hurt for it. He'd have rathered have Aunt Petunia, Uncle Vernon and Dudley with him. Remus, Anthony and Sirius would've been brilliant, too. All of them would've been the best.</p>
<p>Instead it was just Harry sneaking onto the train with Mr. Swashlin to see him off.</p>
<p>It felt very wrong.</p>
<p>"Be careful," Mr. Swashlin said softly but very, very seriously. "Use your letter box to send a message if you need anything. Don't rely on Hedwig. There's many ways letters sent by owls can be meddled with and we've yet to figure out where all your support payments went."</p>
<p>"I will be," Harry promised. "You be careful, too. He knows now. I don't want you or the others to be in danger if you can help it. And make sure that… you know, the other problem…" he tapped his forehead, "is taken care of as quick as you can."</p>
<p>"From what Anthony's said, it's only a matter of weeks," Mr. Swashlin said. His smile went grim and determined but not at all worried. "By Halloween at the latest."</p>
<p>"Good," Harry said as Neville and his grandmother came through the floo together. "Oh, there's Neville! I better get going."</p>
<p>"Yes, you should," Mr. Swashlin said.</p>
<p>He let go and Harry ran over to Neville who looked desperately glad to see him. Neville had a toad in his hands that didn't look especially pleased to be there. Madame Longbottom didn't look especially pleased to be there, either, but she smiled kindly at Harry.</p>
<p>"You've got all your things, Neville?" Madame Longbottom asked just like Mr. Swashlin and probably every single parent or guardian on the platform.</p>
<p>"Yes, Gran," Neville said. "I just… a toad?"</p>
<p>"He means well," Madame Longbottom said with a tired sigh. "If you don't wish to take him, I can return him to the garden for you."</p>
<p>"You don't want a toad?" Harry asked.</p>
<p>"Uncle Algie gave him to me just before we came," Neville explained, still cupping the toad awkwardly in his hands. It was bigger than Neville's hands together, big and squashy and very disgruntled looking. "He said I needed a familiar but…"</p>
<p>The toad rolled an eye up at Neville. Neville stared back at the toad with a befuddled expression. Harry grinned before gently touching the toad and Neville at the same time while very softly asking the family magic if it would work or not.</p>
<p>A very firm 'no' was the answer from the Potter magic. The Black magic all but rolled its eyes. The Longbottom magic sent a little huff of teal-green sparkles around both Neville and the toad who kicked once but otherwise didn't react.</p>
<p>"Ah," Madame Longbottom said. She held out a hand. "Give him to me, Neville. I'll see him home. Onto the train with the both of you. Best seats are in the front, you know."</p>
<p>She demanded a one-armed hug from Neville, got an enthusiastic one from Harry that made her blush and splutter and then smile at them both fondly. She stood on the platform next to Mr. Swashlin as Harry and Neville got onboard.</p>
<p>One of the older students showed them where to put their resized trunks for the trip to Hogwarts. Then Harry led the way up the train, dodging by chattering kids, teenagers and a single adult who looked like she'd much rather be anywhere but there.</p>
<p>The lead car was full of prefects in their uniforms who frowned when Harry opened the door.</p>
<p>"Sorry," Harry said, grinning at them. "Just seeing what everything is. You're prefects? That's brilliant!"</p>
<p>"Harry," Neville whispered behind him. </p>
<p>He tugged on Harry's sleeve, but Harry forged right in and thrust a hand at the very stern-looking redhead who studied Harry with a frown. The other prefects just smiled at Harry.</p>
<p>"It's so nice to meet you," Harry declared. "I'm Harry Potter."</p>
<p>The stern looks went away, replaced by startled stares. The red-headed prefect hesitantly took Harry's hand, giving it a quick pump. His family magic screamed at Harry from behind blocks that seemed even tighter than what Lucius and Sirius had been under. Harry didn't flinch. He just smiled up at the blocked prefect expectantly.</p>
<p>"Ah, Percy Weasley," the prefect said. "A pleasure."</p>
<p>Harry did the same with every single one of the prefects, much to the girls' amusement. All of them were under blocks though none were as strongly blocked as Percy. Gemma Farley wasn't too badly affected. Robert Hillard felt rather powerfully charmed though his family magic didn't seem too upset by it. Or maybe it was just not all that large. Gabriel Truman from Hufflepuff was cheerfully compliant with his blocks in ways that made Harry want to shake him until his teeth rattled. But all of them were affected, every single one.</p>
<p>It made his skin crawl so as soon as he'd introduced himself, Harry waved towards Neville and the door.</p>
<p>"I'm going to go meet more people," Harry declared. "Thanks so much, though. It was really nice to meet you all"</p>
<p>"Enjoy… the trip, Mr. Potter," Percy said, blinking at him in confusion.</p>
<p>Harry slung the door shut just as the train whistle blew and they started to roll. Neville staggered as the train car jerked. He grabbed at Harry's elbow so that he didn't fall down. He looked so terribly embarrassed to have stumbled, or maybe it was Harry's forceful introducing himself. Felt like he was embarrassed, too.</p>
<p>"They've all got blocks on their family magic, Neville," Harry whispered to him so that no one else in the hallway could hear him. Not that they probably would. They were too busy waving to their families back on the platform.</p>
<p>"That's why you did that!" Neville gasped. "I don't… think I can do that, Harry."</p>
<p>"Don't," Harry said. "Let's find Draco and Susan, see if we can get a carriage. I want to collect as many unblocked kids as I can. I'll send them to visit you. Then you and Draco can distribute the protection charms. I've got a hundred spares. The goblins made me lots of them, more than I expected. I should have plenty to cover all of our year and maybe more once we figure out how to help people."</p>
<p>"Oh, that I can do," Neville said with much more confidence.</p>
<p>Draco was with Susan, the two of them sitting in a carriage about halfway down the train. Both of them looked a little nervous until Harry walked in with Neville. Then Draco leaped to his feet and Susan sighed gustily like she'd been waiting for him to show up and was afraid they'd missed the train.</p>
<p>"Where have you been?" Draco demanded.</p>
<p>"Meeting people," Harry said. He waved to Neville and then pulled out the sack of charms. "I'm going to go meet more people. I'm going to go meet everyone. Every single student on the train. The ones who aren't blocked, I'll send them here. I'll tell them that I'm passing out charms to people I like. You guys give them to them. It'll protect their minds."</p>
<p>"Oh wow," Susan breathed. She bit her lip and fidgeted, smoothing her shirt over her legs. "You're really sure?"</p>
<p>"All the prefects are blocked," Neville said. "Harry started there."</p>
<p>Both Susan and Draco winced. But Draco and Neville took the charms so that Harry could head out and do the shake hands and touch magic thing. Susan came along, smiling brightly and introducing Harry to everyone that she knew. Thankfully, she knew a lot of people because of her aunt.</p>
<p>All the second year and up students had various levels of blocks on their magic. The ones from older families with more active family magic had more blocks. Those with smaller, younger family magic had less. Harry smiled and smiled and smiled until his face hurt, but he kept shaking hands and introducing himself in the hopes of finding any upper year students who weren't blocked.</p>
<p>None were.</p>
<p>All the first-year students, except for one, were unblocked.</p>
<p>"Ron Weasley," Ron said, shaking Harry's hand enthusiastically even though Harry nearly jerked his hand free because of the way the Weasley magic screamed inside of him. "You're really him?"</p>
<p>"Him?" Harry said as he finally freed his hand. "Oh, you mean, you know, The Great Harry Potter. Yeah, no, that's all fiction. They published those books without permission. We're suing."</p>
<p>Ron's eyes bugged out. "Seriously? That's mental."</p>
<p>Harry snorted. "They never paid my family's estate a penny for those things, you know. Took my name and my life, made up a bunch of rubbish, and then I'm supposed to be all happy about it? I mean, if they wanted to use my name, they should've licensed it. Paid a proper fee and royalties. That's how it works. But they didn't even bother. So yeah, we're suing. It's all tripe and we're not standing for it."</p>
<p>"Wow," Ron said. He shook his head. "Well, good luck with that. Um, you want to join my friends and me? We've got room in our carriage."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, thanks," Harry said. He nudged Susan when she opened her mouth to offer to let Ron come with them. "I just wanted to meet everyone. I've got a carriage with my shield brother Neville already. Which, you know, I should get back to him. He's really nervous about the whole sorting thing. His uncle told him all sorts of horrible stories about how it goes and he's just not calming down about it."</p>
<p>"Oh, um, okay," Ron said with a frown. He blinked several times like he was trying to come up with a response.</p>
<p>Just like Dudley used to before the curses came off.</p>
<p>"Maybe we can talk later," Harry suggested with a mental groan at himself and his magic's prodding. The Weasley magic was screaming for help. How could he ignore that? "I just don't want Neville to panic."</p>
<p>"Sure, that'd be brilliant," Ron said.</p>
<p>He headed into the carriage, scowling as a bushy-haired black girl with tears in her eyes stumbled past. She sniffled, breath hitching as she refused to meet anyone's eyes. Harry frowned because he hadn't met her, yet.</p>
<p>"Hey, are you all right?" Harry asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, sorry," the girl said as she quickly dashed her tears away. "They're just… horrible. Why does it matter that I'm Muggleborn?"</p>
<p>"Well, it's a matter of the family magic, actually," Harry said. "I've got books on it in my library trunks if you'd like to borrow them."</p>
<p>Her head came up and for a second Harry could've sworn that her hair lit up like she was electrified. Her warm brown eyes certainly went electric red-gold.</p>
<p>"Library trunk?" she asked. "What's that and why didn't anyone tell me about them?"</p>
<p>Susan laughed. "Oh, dear. You're in for it now. Harry's got all sorts of library trunks."</p>
<p>"Harry?" the girl asked.</p>
<p>Harry grinned and offered his hand. "Harry Potter. Nice to meet you."</p>
<p>"Oh," the girl said as she smiled and shook his hand properly. "Hermione Granger. So nice to meet you, too. I've read about you in Modern Magical History."</p>
<p>Her magic was bright and strong, unblocked or charmed in any way. It was new, too, full of the same sort of clean energy that the elves created as they worked with the family magic. Harry did his best not to stare at Hermione. The other Muggleborns hadn't been so strong. They'd had the same sort of clarity, the same newness, but it wasn't as obvious with less power flowing through them.</p>
<p>When Hermione had children someday, they were going to get a beautiful legacy from her magic.</p>
<p>"Don't believe it all," Harry said with a snort as he made himself let go of her hand. "We're suing the people that wrote those books. Come on. We've got room in our carriage and you're going to love library trunks. They're amazing! I've got three, each with different sorts of books in them. The Obsolete and Inaccurate Information Only to be Read for Amusement's Sake trunk is a hoot."</p>
<p>Hermione started giggling despite her puffy eyes and sniffling. Susan rolled her eyes. Hermione followed them back to the carriage and settled in happily with Harry and Draco as they showed her how library trunks worked. Giving her the charm was almost an afterthought. She did stare at the little thing suspiciously but put it on after Susan nodded reassuringly.</p>
<p>"So, tell me about family magic," Hermione said, wiggling on the seat and fixing Harry and Draco with a stern little stare. "Tell me all about it."</p>

  <p>Sirius sighed as he settled into the couch that Silverclaw had had moved into his office. As much time as he, Remus and Anthony were spending there, a better place to sit was necessary. There were also new bookshelves carved into the walls, full of paperwork, ledgers and scrolls. A new set of worktables sat against the back wall, covered with things for the ongoing audit.</p>
<p>If anyone had suggested, say Peter or James, back when they were all kids that Sirius would someday be as comfortable with a goblin as he was with them, he would have laughed in their faces. Any goblin. Their faces, the teeth and ears and scowls, had terrified him as a child.</p>
<p>Now Sirius could look at Silverclaw and see just why every goblin that walked into his office paused to stare at Silverclaw as if they'd just seen the most beautiful thing since a fully justified fee against the Ministry. It was a bit brain-bending to be able to see those long, agile claws and sharp teeth as beautiful, not to mention the heavy eyebrows and Silverclaw's pronounced earlobes and the arching tips of his ears.</p>
<p>"Do go get to work," Petunia told Anthony as she marched into Silverclaw's office as if she owned it. "We need you in place to defend Vernon and Dudley if That Man decides to strike back against Harry's family."</p>
<p>"I'm going, I'm going," Anthony said even though he obviously didn't want to. He scuffed one toe against the stone floor. "Lacey's got her sisters making sure that Dudley will be safe at school. One of them got a job teaching there. She's the new Physical Education teacher."</p>
<p>Both Sirius' eyebrows went up at the same time that one of Petunia's did. She snorted and then flipped her slender, elegant fingers at Anthony, shooing him back out of Silverclaw's office like he was as young as Harry and Dudley. Anthony grinned, nodded to Sirius and scampered.</p>
<p>His heart hurt to see Anthony go.</p>
<p>How weird was it to have relatives that he wanted to have around? Pretty bloody weird. Even weirder to look at Petunia and see someone well worth knowing.</p>
<p>Lily had never been kind when she talked about her family. Snape had mentioned, early on the train as they'd all become instant enemies due to Dumbledore's spells of manipulation wrapped around the train and the boat ride and the feast, that Petunia was older, smarter and much scarier than Lily. Where Lily was sunshine, smiles and knives in the back, Petunia was stern looks, skies as grey as her eyes and a knife sliding into your liver as she stared into your eyes. And then down at your cooling body before stepping over you calmly and coolly.</p>
<p>Now, seeing Petunia this way?</p>
<p>Snape hadn't been all that wrong about both Lily and Petunia. Lily's pranking had always been secret and vicious, mostly directed against the pure-bloods who made her and other muggle-borns' lives difficult. Sirius would pay a lot to watch Petunia tear those same grown-up asses to shreds. She probably wouldn't even break her stride.</p>
<p>"Kreacher," Petunia said.</p>
<p>"Ah, he probably won't…" Sirius snapped his mouth shut as Kreacher appeared as quickly and as apparently willingly as he ever had for Mother.</p>
<p>Kreacher frowned at Sirius, snapped his fingers and suddenly Sirius' face was clean and dry, his clothes straightened up and he was sitting up far more properly on the couch.</p>
<p>"Mistress needed Kreacher?" Kreacher turned back to Petunia.</p>
<p>"I do," Petunia said. She sat in the hard oak chair in front of Silverclaw's desk. "I need you and the other elves to watch over Harry. You shouldn't let yourselves be seen, but I want at least one of you to be on duty protecting him at all times. Take shifts to make sure that no one is overextended."</p>
<p>"Um," Sirius sighed as he moved to stand. "Petunia, they're Black family elves and you…"</p>
<p>Both Petunia and Kreacher glared at Sirius, much to Silverclaw's squinty-eyed amusement.</p>
<p>"Kreacher will do that," Kreacher told Petunia. He completely ignored Sirius' dropped jaw. "Mistress Pet wants us to guard Dudley, too?"</p>
<p>"Keep an ear out for him," Petunia said, smiling as she patted Kreacher's shoulder, "but I don't expect that he'll need as much as Harry. That boy. He gets in more trouble than anyone I've ever known short of his mother."</p>
<p>"Kreacher knows," Kreacher said with a tired, heart-felt sigh. "Crow will be watching over Master Sirius."</p>
<p>"Good," Petunia said.</p>
<p>Both of them completely ignored Sirius' splutters of outrage. He didn't need someone to watch over him. He was fine. A little sick and weak yet, but fine.</p>
<p>Petunia turned to Silverclaw and started questioning him about the audit, leaving Sirius to pout on the couch and glare at the backs of their heads. Really, you'd think that Petunia was the head of the Black family instead of Sirius. Someday he was going to figure out how she did it.</p>
<p>And then he'd figure out how to copy it, so people treated him with as much respect as they did Petunia in a snit. Better still, he'd figure it out and then teach it to Harry so that he had the joy of watching Harry set the world on its ear even more than he already did.</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>By the time they reached Hogsmeade, Harry had firm friends in Draco, Neville, Hermione, Susan, Susan's best friend Hannah, and Blaise. They'd all been horrified by all the stuff Harry told them about how he was raised and how his family had been cursed. Blaise, in particular, had cursed like Uncle Vernon when his favorite rugby team lost the finals after finding out that all the older students were affected by the blocks.</p>
<p>"We're going to this school," Blaise complained for the ninth time as they all gathered their things and got ready to leave the train. "We should be safe here."</p>
<p>"I know," Harry agreed, again, "but we're not. If you can, find a way to ask your parents for a letter box. That way no one can intercept your mail. I've got one the goblins made for me. If you need me to, I can have Aunt Petunia or the goblins mail the letter for you."</p>
<p>"I'll be taking you up on that," Draco said with a scowl as he adjusted Neville's tie and settled Neville's robes across his shoulders. "Oh, do stop that, Hermione. Let me do it."</p>
<p>"Sorry," Hermione apologized as she fidgeted her way through Draco straightening her up. "Madame Malkin didn't exactly explain the proper way to tie it. Or how to wear these."</p>
<p>"No one did," Harry said. "I had to have it explained to me, too. Which is really weird. You'd think that people would get at least an instruction book on ties. My cousin Dudley got one for how to wear his uniform for Smeltings. He was gobsmacked that we didn't get anything at all."</p>
<p>Harry led the way out into the hallway, not very excited about the whole sorting thing. He was kind of worried about the sorting, in a 'is this how Dumbledore spells people' sort of way. Not in the 'where will I end up' sort of way because whatever house he was put in would be good. Harry would make it good, somehow.</p>
<p>Draco was probably going to be Slytherin, so he'd have a friend there. Neville was convinced he'd be in Hufflepuff so that would be fine. Hermione seemed destined for Ravenclaw given how smart she was, but she was also really, really fierce so she might end up in Gryffindor. Another friend there. And Susan had shrugged and said she expected Hufflepuff given her family legacy, but would be fine with anything. Hannah had nodded along with her while Blaise had said that he'd be perfect no matter what house he was in.</p>
<p>Two tall redheaded twins were in the hallway, leaning against the wall like they were too tired to do anything like walking. Weasleys, definitely. They had the same hair and the same eyes and the same jaws and the same worn-out looking robes that were just the right side of threadbare.</p>
<p>"I don't think we've met," Harry said as he walked up to them. Neville and Susan both groaned behind him. "I'm Harry Potter."</p>
<p>"Why, bless my soul," the one of the right said with a blooming and rather nerve-wracking grin. He took Harry's hand and shook it. Enthusiastically.</p>
<p>"It's Harry Potter, as I live and breathe," the left one said as he took Harry's other hand and shook that with intense, deliberate, obvious pompousness that made Harry laugh at them both.</p>
<p>The left twin's grin was a tiny bit wider than the right twin's but both of them felt of ferocious Weasley magic and mischief, wild and wonderful in ways completely different from the elves or Hermione or the Potter magic or even the Black magic.</p>
<p>Neither of them were blocked.</p>
<p>There were shreds of blocks, bits and pieces in tatters at the edges of their magic but that was it. In them, the Weasley magic was raging, angry, defiant, clawing at the remnants of the blocks with a fury that Harry completely understood. </p>
<p>But they were free. They were the only older students who were free, on the whole train. Harry stared at them for a long moment, his grin blooming to match theirs.</p>
<p>"And you are?" Harry asked.</p>
<p>"George Weasley," the twin on the right said.</p>
<p>"And Fred Weasley," the one of the left finished. He winked. "At least for the moment. You never know. Might change any second."</p>
<p>Harry laughed. And then winced as Ron ran up, his tie a mess and his robes askew around him.</p>
<p>"Fred, George, I can't get this thing tied right," Ron exclaimed. "Oh, hey, Harry. You look good."</p>
<p>"That's all Draco," Harry said, pointing to Draco who looked so appalled by Ron's robes that Harry laughed. "Let him help. He'll twitch forever if you don't."</p>
<p>Ron didn't look happy about it at all, but he did let Draco pull him off into the compartment. Harry watched his back as he went and then turned back to Fred and George. The others were waiting but the rest of the students had already gotten off the train.</p>
<p>"You broke the blocks," Harry whispered.</p>
<p>"Ah, the Great Harry Potter sees things," George said in a very low murmur.</p>
<p>"That we did," Fred agreed. "You'll want to be careful. They're applied in the classrooms and at meals. Also during the sorting, when you're in the infirmary and sometimes when you're wandering about the halls. We've tried to figure out how it's done but haven't succeeded yet."</p>
<p>Harry nodded and pulled two of the amulets for them. "These should help. Wear them. I'm gonna want to talk to you later about how to break the blocks on the Weasley magic. It's screaming."</p>
<p>Both Fred and George winced. They put on the amulets and sucked in identical breaths. Then they bracketed Harry in very nervous-making ways while grinning far too widely at him. Neville whined behind them as Susan groaned again. Hannah hid behind Susan while Hermione and Blaise leveled narrow-eyed glares at Fred and George.</p>
<p>"Ickle Harry Potter saving everyone," George exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Who'd've thought?" Fred finished.</p>
<p>"Oh, everyone who's met me," Harry replied. He laughed when they stared. "You two are going to be fun but we should get going. The train's already empty."</p>
<p>Draco emerged just then with a much-improved Ron who looked profoundly sulky about it. Not sulky enough to undo the tie and mess up the robe but clearly not happy. Fred and George grinned, leaping on Ron who squawked and flailed to try to get free.</p>
<p>"Ickle Ronnikins!" Fred exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Mum would be so proud to see her little boy all grown up," George said, one hand dramatically pressed over his heart.</p>
<p>"Geroff!" Ron huffed and managed to wiggle free. "Why do you have to be that way?"</p>
<p>They laughed, winked at Harry and then sauntered towards the exit without answering. Harry shook his head. He really did need to talk to them but wow, it was probably going to be trouble to do so. Ron grumbled under his breath as he stomped after them, leaving Harry's party to follow.</p>
<p>Outside, the other students were talking and gossiping as if they hadn't just spent the last day on a train together. There were a couple of instructors directing the older students towards some carriages that didn't seem to have horses to pull them. Hagrid was off on the side shouting for the first years to come with him.</p>
<p>"Enjoy the sorting, Firsties!" George exclaimed as he bowed at Harry.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, it doesn't hurt much," Fred said with a mirrored bow for Ron who whined and went so pale that his freckles stood out like paint.</p>
<p>They laughed as they ran for the carriages. Hagrid shook his head at them but smiled brightly when he saw Harry.</p>
<p>"Made it all right, did ye?" Hagrid asked.</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said. He grinned up at Hagrid. "The train was brilliant. I sent my owl on ahead. I named her Hedwig. Thank you again for her, Hagrid. She's wonderful and I love her."</p>
<p>Hagrid went red in the face, shuffling his huge feet and sniffling like he was about to burst into tears. After a second, he nodded, took a gusty breath and then lead them all off to a series of small boats.</p>
<p>"Four per boat," Hagrid told them all. "Don't worry 'bout rowing. They're spelled to take ye where ye need to go."</p>
<p>Hermione joined Harry. So did Neville. Harry expected Draco to join them, but Ron pushed past him into the boat, so Draco rolled his eyes and went with Blaise, Susan and Hannah. Each of the boats had a beautiful lantern with a magical flame on it. Harry kind of wanted to poke at it but that would rock the boat and Neville looked nervous enough as it was.</p>
<p>"Oh! Look!" Hermione gasped.</p>
<p>She pointed ahead of them where Hogwarts had just appeared around a bend in the shore. It was up on a cliff, shining from within by lights that flickered and blazed and danced in ways that candles didn't and neither did electric lights.</p>
<p>"It's beautiful," Neville breathed.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Ron agreed.</p>
<p>"I wonder what it looks like inside," Harry said.</p>
<p>He had a thousand different things he wanted to say that he couldn't with Ron in the boat. It wouldn't be too smart to say them on the lake anyway, what with the way sound carried over water. But Ron's presence and the screaming Weasley magic inside of him made it all the harder. And all the more necessary to keep his tongue between his teeth.</p>
<p>It felt like before the letter came in all the bad ways that made Harry's skin crawl. He really wasn't sure that he was going to be able to do this, not if he had to watch what he said and did every single second. Not if he had to worry about all of them being…</p>
<p>"Oh," Harry said, horrified.</p>
<p>"What?" Hermione asked.</p>
<p>"I need to talk to Hannah and Blaise when we get off the boats," Harry said. "Really quickly."</p>
<p>"They're just a boat ahead of us," Neville said. "It should be easy."</p>
<p>"Why you wanna talk to them?" Ron asked with a scowl. "A slimy snake and a puff? They're not important."</p>
<p>Harry stared at him for a long moment. The stare didn't do anything to budge Ron's sullen attitude. It didn't even seem to enter his brain that they were all frowning at him.</p>
<p>"It's about the sorting," Harry said. "Something the twins said that I wanted to warn them about. See, I figure they'll call us alphabetically or maybe reverse alphabetically so Hannah and Blaise will be first. You know, if they start with A or with Z."</p>
<p>"Oh," Ron said, shifting to a much more nervous expression that still didn't seem to connect with his eyes properly. It was like watching a ball trying to roll through treacle. "You don't think I have to worry, do you?"</p>
<p>"Gran said it's always in alphabetical order," Neville offered. "You'll probably be next to last."</p>
<p>"Oh, good," Ron said with a huge sigh of relief.</p>
<p>As soon as the boat landed, Harry dashed off and caught Hannah's hand. She started and then frowned at Harry as if him holding her hand was somehow very, very improper. Harry pushed with the Potter magic, trying to warn the Abbot magic that she was about to be blocked and spelled and trapped into obeying Dumbledore.</p>
<p>He asked, in a desperate, wild sort of way, for the Abbot magic to try and break whatever it was that was going to attack Hannah. It growled like the Weasley magic did around the twins. Protective magic surged around Hannah and Harry.</p>
<p>Hannah gasped. "Oh. Oh wow."</p>
<p>"Focus really hard on the charm," Harry said. "Feel it. Feel what it does, and then try to wrap the same thing around your magic. Your mind and your heart and everything. Your magic will help you. I'll be trying to do the same thing with the Gryffindor magic. I mean, it's supposed to be my castle. Maybe I can help?"</p>
<p>"I'll try," Hannah promised even though she looked terrified.</p>
<p>"We'll all try," Susan said. "And we'll get help if you fail, I promise."</p>
<p>"The Weasley twins will help," Harry agreed. "They found a way to break free."</p>
<p>That helped calm Hannah down dramatically. She and Susan headed up into Hogwarts holding hands. Draco blew out a breath next to Harry. All the first years, other than Ron who'd already headed after Hagrid, were watching him. Ron didn't notice. He was too busy asking when they'd get to eat.</p>
<p>"The sorting does something," Harry told all the other first years. "Be careful, focus on your family magic and try to do what the charm does. In, you know, a sort of 'please work!' sort of way since its really complicated goblin magic that we won't learn for years."</p>
<p>"I hope it works," Lavender Brown said.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Neville agreed.</p>
<p>"We'll figure something out if it doesn't," Harry said. "My family's already working on it. And really, the Weasley twins did figure it out. It can be done. We'll be fine. We just have to be brave as we can and do our best. If we take care of each other it'll be good. It'll be fine."</p>
<p>He hoped it was true. Harry said it with as much confidence as he could and that seemed to be enough for the other first years. They all trooped after Hagrid and Ron, heading into Hogwarts together. Harry hadn't ever thought he'd be doing something like this.</p>
<p>Facing down spells and enemies who were in charge of his life for the next seven years. Friends with Dudley and fond of his aunt and uncle instead of afraid of them. Harry raised his chin and made his shoulders relax. He'd gotten this far. He'd make it through the sorting, too. Whether his Dark Lord enemy was Voldemort or Dumbledore, Harry would survive.</p>
<p>Probably.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Severus sniffed, his lip curling up as he sauntered by Filius' side. "I fail to see why it's a concern."</p>
<p>"Really?" Filius asked Severus with enough of a frown for Severus' pale cheeks to flush pinker. "He's lost a good two stone, Severus. Quirrell's obviously quite ill. He's stammering, flinching at shadows and Minerva swore before Albus returned that she caught a faint scent of rot around the poor man."</p>
<p>As sour as Severus always was, he did frown with some level of concern about the rot. But the sheen of mind alteration shimmered across his eyes and the sneer returned. Damn Albus for his meddling. What was to be gained by keeping people from realizing just how sick Quirrell was?</p>
<p>"It was probably Quirrell's beloved garlic going bad," Severus said. He snorted. "Though, honestly, it's likely just the garlic itself. He's always had a bit of a fondness for garlic. His new obsession with it is making it hard enough to breathe that I'd doubt even Minerva's nose."</p>
<p>Filius breathed a laugh even though he wanted to hex Severus silly. "That is true. You have to admit, his favorite korma is delicious."</p>
<p>"Well, of course," Severus said as they entered the Great Hall. "I'm just glad it isn't often served in the Great Hall. Not many of the students here can handle Quirrell's level of garlic."</p>
<p>They shared a small smile at that, almost as though Severus was in his right mind. But the shimmer in his eyes shouted that no, he wasn't all right. None of the instructors were. Filius had been purged over the summer break, as he always was. Hopefully this time the charms he'd purchased would be sufficient to allow him to keep his own mind for more than a few hours.</p>
<p>Probably not. Nothing had worked so far. If it weren't for the children themselves, Filius would quit his job and go work somewhere else. Perhaps for the Goblin Horde. Or perhaps at Beauxbatons.</p>
<p>The older students were starting to file in, chatting amongst themselves as they played out the roles that Albus had assigned to them.</p>
<p>The Slytherins sneered at the Gryffindors. The Gryffindors blustered and played mean little pranks. Nearly every Ravenclaw had a book in their hands, whether they were the bookish type of learner or not. He would have to do some careful work tonight to ease the new restrictions placed on them as they entered Hogwarts today. The Hufflepuffs travelled as a group, smiling and chatting even though Filius knew that some of them were true introverts who'd rather have quiet contemplation before facing the overwhelm that was the feast.</p>
<p>He settled into his chair at the head table, rubbing his nose against the powerful scent of garlic that lingered like a cloud around Quirrell. Really, he needed to see if he could get Poppy functional enough to check on poor Quirrell. His cheeks were sunken, his eyes had bags as dark as Severus' robes and his hands shook as he sat at the end of the table.</p>
<p>Albus smiled in his central throne like a benevolent god looking down at his worshipful subjects.</p>
<p>If he ever got the chance, Filius was going to blast Albus through a wall. He'd have to steal that wand of Albus' first, of course. No one else at the school had the gifts to see just how powerful the wand was. None of them had goblin blood.</p>
<p>Filius could see it glowing in Albus' holster, throbbing as if it had a pulse of its own. Someday. Someday, somehow, he would get that wand away from Albus and then the hidden tyrant of Britain was going to get some of his own medicine. Probably delivered by Quirrell's fists straight to the teeth and then by Minerva.</p>
<p>If he got very lucky, she might transform Albus into a rat and do it literally. It was certainly the least that Albus deserved for all his crimes.</p>
<p>He buried a smirk into a smile that he made as genuine as he could for the first years coming in with Minerva. Yes, somehow, perhaps even this year, Filius would steal Albus' wand and then he'd find a way to free Minerva so that she could tear Albus to shreds.</p>
<p>He sighed.</p>
<p>It was a lovely dream. Maybe someday he'd find a way to make it reality, though that would probably take all the founders' magics being claimed and Voldemort dying. That was as likely to happen as Hagrid deciding that he needed to wear a pink tutu to go with his umbrella while he danced with singing dragons out by the lake with the giant squid.</p>
<p>Still, Minerva tearing Albus apart would be delightful.</p>
<p>He smiled as the Sorting Hat began to sing.</p>
<p>Such a lovely idea.</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>"Abbott, Hannah!"</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall smiled tightly at Hannah as she gulped and slowly sat on the stool that had held the Sorting Hat until just a moment before. The hat was a lumpy, threadbare mess that looked and felt alive. Harry'd been quite awed by the magical mural on the ceiling at first, but the Sorting Hat had captured his attention the instant he saw it.</p>
<p>It felt blocked even though Harry wasn't anywhere near to touching it.</p>
<p>The Abbott magic shivered in Harry's hand. He'd touched Hannah, connecting her magic to his just before she went up to the stool. Dumbledore's head had come up and the twinkle in his eyes had gone hard and dark for a second, but it was too late for him to do anything because the hat was already descending onto Hannah's head.</p>
<p>Harry shoved at the blocks on the Sorting Hat while Hannah whispered something under her breath with one hand pressed against the charm that lay invisible against her throat. Sparks of light appeared in the Sorting Hat's eyes as it fidgeted on Hannah's head. Then Hannah started, grinned and started giggling.</p>
<p>"Hufflepuff!" the Sorting Hat yelled.</p>
<p>Hannah pulled the Hat off and passed it to Professor McGonagall who frowned as Hannah ran off to the Hufflepuff table. The Sorting Hat wiggled in her hand, startling Professor McGonagall so badly that she dropped it back down to the stool.</p>
<p>It seemed better. Less blocked. Not blocked? Harry couldn't tell but the Abbott magic was happy and Hannah waved to Harry so he let the Abbott magic go. He kept on doing it for everyone who was called in front of him. </p>
<p>Hermione's magic vibrated so badly through her hair that the Hat barely even seemed able to sit on her head. The Hat looked happy about that and shouted 'Ravenclaw' almost the instant it was put on her.</p>
<p>Neville gulped as he took the stool and flinched under the Sorting Hat. Harry's magic swirled with the Longbottom magic, earning another hard look from Dumbledore and a faintly concerned frown from Professor McGonagall. But none of that mattered as the Sorting Hat snorted and announced 'Gryffindor!'</p>
<p>Draco, unsurprisingly, went to Slytherin. He'd said that he was pretty much guaranteed that house and looked very happy as he settled in next to his new house mates. Harry was a little sad that he wouldn't, no matter what, have all his friends in the same house with him but that hardly mattered. They could still be friends, no matter what houses they slept in.</p>
<p>"Potter, Harry," Professor McGonagall announced finally.</p>
<p>Harry smiled at Blaise who patted his shoulder and blew out a breath as he marched up to the stool. The whole hall was quiet as he took the stool and then the Sorting Hat landed on his head.</p>
<p>"Good to finally meet you directly, Mr. Potter," the Sorting Hat said directly into Harry's head. "My thanks for breaking the enchantments on me."</p>
<p>"Oh, you're welcome," Harry muttered. He couldn't really see anything. The brim of the Sorting Hat blocked his view of the room. There was a little torn spot that was shaped just like Ireland in front of Harry's nose. "I'm glad that I could help. Do I need to worry about the others?"</p>
<p>"No, Mr. Potter, you do not," the Sorting Hat declared. "I will, of course, be enchanted again once this is over, but you need not worry about that."</p>
<p>Harry huffed at the Sorting Hat. "Of course I need to worry about it! That’s horrible. No one should be spelled and blocked and controlled that way."</p>
<p>The Sorting Hat chuckled. "Well, you'd best claim your position as the Heir to Gryffindor then, Mr. Potter. I'd suggest Slytherin given how sneaky you've been about this, but I see that it was all your aunt's doing, not yours."</p>
<p>Harry blushed. "Yeah, I'm a bit… straight-forward, I guess."</p>
<p>"That you are," the Sorting Hat agreed. "Better be… Gryffindor!"</p>
<p>Only the last word was said out loud. Harry started and lifted the Sorting Hat off his head. When he passed it to Professor McGonagall, she was smiling so proudly that he blushed harder. Then he ran off to the Gryffindor table to sit next to Neville.</p>
<p>"It was chatty," Harry murmured to Neville as the sorting continued.</p>
<p>"I know," Neville agreed, keeping his voice down so that it wouldn't carry over the sound of the continued Sorting. "I was really surprised. It was so curious about you, Harry. And how you'd known that it was spelled."</p>
<p>Harry shrugged. "It was kind of obvious and the twins warned me. Be careful about the food and classrooms, too."</p>
<p>Neville shuddered. Eventually, everyone was sorted. Ron ended up in Gryffindor. Blaise ended up in Slytherin right next to Draco. Once everyone was at their tables, Dumbledore stood and smiled at them all. It was probably supposed to look very kindly, very grandfather-like, but the hard look in Dumbledore's eyes whenever he looked Harry's way ruined the effect.</p>
<p>At least, all the first years noticed it and shivered. The teachers and other years just watched Dumbledore with blandly accepting expressions that made the hair on the back of Harry's neck stand up.</p>
<p>His welcoming speech was… odd. Just four words that Harry couldn't figure out: Nitwit, blubber, oddment and tweak. It was, at least, short. Given that their food was magically delivered by house elf magic to the table as soon as Dumbledore sat down, Harry wasn't too upset about it.</p>
<p>The food was amazing, despite the lingering feeling of the house elves not being very happy or fulfilled. Harry's amulet warned him away from the pumpkin juice, something he'd never heard of before and really wasn't sure he wanted to try. Who'd juice a pumpkin? Why? The rest of the food was fine, other than the treacle tarts and a rice dish with raisons in it that Harry avoided along with all the other first years but Ron.</p>
<p>Ron ate everything. Everything in front of him with a sort of urgency that made him look greedy and slobby, but Harry thought he could see an edge of desperation in Ron's eyes. It was like he was starving and the food couldn't fill him up.</p>
<p>After years spent blocked and Dudley's experience with his block, Harry had to think that Ron was going through exactly that. It might not matter how much he ate. It wouldn't fill his belly or make him feel as though he'd had enough.</p>
<p>Horrifying thought. Harry had to get the twins to the side sometime soon to ask them just how they broke free. Once everyone, even Ron, finished eating, Dumbledore stood up once more.</p>
<p>"Now that we have all eaten and slaked our thirst, I have some start of term notices," Dumbledore said with a stern little smile that didn't get any nicer as his eyes twinkled extra-hard. "As always, the Forbidden Forest is forbidden. Some of our older students would do well to remember that."</p>
<p>He glanced at the Weasley twins who both put on angelic expressions and batted their eyes at him.</p>
<p>"Mr. Filch would remind everyone that there is to be no magic in the hallways," Dumbledore continued. "Those who break that rule will lose house points and have to serve most unpleasant detentions with Mr. Filch. Madame Hooch will be holding Quidditch trials in the second week of the term. Those interested should approach her for details."</p>
<p>Dumbledore lowered his chin and swept his gaze across the room. Everyone, Harry included, stilled and stared up at him. Once they'd quieted enough, not that anyone had been chatting during his speech, Dumbledore continued.</p>
<p>"Finally, I must warn you all that the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a painful death," Dumbledore intoned while staring straight at Harry as if daring him to go look right then.</p>
<p>Harry laughed, weakly, though almost no one other than Hermione did. After their laughter died out, Dumbledore smiled at them all and they sang the school song which was ridiculous, to any tune they wanted, completely out of sync with each other. The Weasley twins finished last because they'd chosen a very slow funeral march that they put their backs into. You'd have thought that they were singing for King Arthur's trip to the afterlife instead of making everyone wait to go to their rooms.</p>
<p>"Ah, lovely," Dumbledore said, wiping a fake tear from his eye, once the twins finished with a final note so low that they broke out coughing after they held it too long. "Now, off to bed. Welcome to Hogwarts, everyone!"</p>
<p>The final look he threw Harry's way was anything but welcoming.</p>
<p>Not that it really mattered. They were free to leave, and Harry was glad. Percy led all the first year Gryffindors out into the hallways and then up flights of stairs that moved under their feet. They encountered Peeves, a poltergeist with a very childish personality, before eventually coming to a very large painting of a very large woman dressed in a very formal pink gown.</p>
<p>"This is the door to our common room," Percy said. "The password this week is Caput Draconis. Don't forget it because you can't get in without it."</p>
<p>Harry was going to ask Percy who they gave it to when the lady in the painting nodded firmly at him.</p>
<p>"That's right. I won't let you in without it," the pink lady declared.</p>
<p>"Oh, wow," Harry said, smiling up at her. "That's brilliant. What's your name, ma'am? I'd hate to be rude."</p>
<p>"She's the Fat Lady," Percy said so dismissively that Harry glowered at him.</p>
<p>"My name is Fellona, young man," the pink lady said with a stern glare at Percy. "Thank you for asking. Few do these days. Such manners you're taught anymore. It's a travesty."</p>
<p>"Ah, sorry," Percy said as his face went as red as his hair.</p>
<p>Either way, Fellona opened the door to the round tunnel beyond, and let them into the Gryffindor common room. It was round and red and cozily warm with squashy sofas and desks tucked away that you could study at. Harry loved it instantly.</p>
<p>"Girls' dorm is off that way," Percy said, waving, "and the boys' is this way. The bathrooms are the next floor up. Be sure to get cleaned up before breakfast or you won't have time until the evening. Your things have already been put in your rooms. First years have the lowest level rooms. It goes upwards from there so that seventh years have the very top. I strongly recommend knocking before you open any door above third year. Just a recommendation."</p>
<p>Harry exchanged looks with Neville who looked as alarmed as Harry felt about that little recommendation, but he was too tired to ask further about it. He wasn't sure that he wanted to know more, frankly.</p>
<p>Harry's dorm room had five beds in it, one for each of the first-year boys. Harry's was close to the window. Neville was near his feet and Ron was next to Harry, closest to the door. Seamus and Dean had the beds on the far side of their half-circle room.</p>
<p>"Man, I'm exhausted," Ron said through a jaw-cracking yawn.</p>
<p>"Me too," Seamus said as he flung himself onto his bed.</p>
<p>"Sleep?" Harry suggested. He got nods all around.</p>
<p>They all switched to their night clothes. Harry, as was his habit, pulled out his Things To Learn library trunk. He'd finished his second book on goblin customs on the way to Hogwarts in the odd quiet moments, so he switched to the third in-depth history of the house elves. Maybe that could tell him what to do about the poor elves here. Or maybe a book on the Gryffindor family? The Sorting Hat had implied that there was something he could do.</p>
<p>"Why're you studying already?" Ron complained.</p>
<p>"It helps me sleep," Harry said with a shrug. "I mean, I fall asleep with a book on my face half the time, but it still helps. Besides, there's tons of stuff I want to learn that aren't going to be taught. Reading before bed helps me learn it."</p>
<p>"Ugh," Ron groaned as he buried his face in his pillow. His complaint came out all mushy because of it. "You should've been in Ravenclaw with an attitude like that."</p>
<p>He started snoring before Harry had a chance to reply. Ron snored like he was going to rattle the windows out of their frames which was horrifying. Neville shook his head and went to pull Ron's curtain's shut. The sound immediately dropped to almost nothing.</p>
<p>"It takes a lot to get through those curtains," Neville said with awe. "Gran told me that they're spelled to keep all sound down so that you can sleep. Uncle Algie said that even the most enthusiastic hijinks wouldn't be heard but I wasn't sure what he meant by that."</p>
<p>"Sex," Seamus said. He grinned when Harry and Neville stared at him. "That's what he meant. Also what Percy meant with his warning. Me mam warned me about that. It's all about sex, apparently."</p>
<p>"That better not happen this year," Harry said, horrified.</p>
<p>The others snickered at him but really. They were eleven. Far too young for those doings. Aunt Petunia would strip someone's hide off for it.</p>
<p>"We're all safe, now, right?" Dean asked very quietly as he pulled his curtains almost shut.</p>
<p>"I… don't know," Harry admitted. "I think we have to assume that the blocks will be coming at us all the time. The Sorting Hat said that I needed to claim something Gryffindor, but I don't know what that means."</p>
<p>"I'll research it tomorrow," Seamus offered. Dean nodded that he'd help too.</p>
<p>"Send a letter to your aunt," Neville advised. "She can research it, too."</p>
<p>"Good idea," Harry said. "I'll just close the curtains for that. No reason to keep you all up with my muttering and scribbling."</p>
<p>It took far too long to write the letter, especially with Harry as tired and full as he was. Harry made three copies of it, one to keep and one to send tomorrow officially with Hedwig who hopefully had made it safely. Harry put the third copy in his letter box. It disappeared, flashing away to home. Hopefully someone would be able to tell him what to do about the Gryffindor thing.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Sirius took a deep breath, tugged the waistcoat that Crow had selected for him down, and then strode into the Ministry with his head held high. It was too soon. Much too soon. He knew it but the one thing that no one had been able to determine so far was just how much control Dumbledore had over the Ministry.</p>
<p>What better way to discover it than by having Sirius Black, notorious murderer, stride back in to request his wand back?</p>
<p>Yes, of course, it was madness. Complete stupidity and the most ridiculous idea that Sirius had had since James was still alive.</p>
<p>Remus had shouted it at the top of his lungs last night. Anthony had groaned and hid his face in his hands. Lacey, lovely woman that she was, had threatened to cut Sirius' bollocks off, slice them thinly, bread them before deep frying them and serving them to him with tartar sauce.</p>
<p>She seemed quite serious about it, too. It was amazing just how much of a type the Black men had. Across generations and whether you were raised in the family or not, Black men always fell for the women who could and would cut their throat and then walk over top of them.</p>
<p>"Master Sirius is being very stupid," Crow murmured.</p>
<p>"You're supposed to be invisible," Sirius murmured back to her.</p>
<p>"Master Sirius us supposed to be healing up," Crow countered without missing a beat. "Not getting hurt worse."</p>
<p>"Hasn't happened yet and we need to know," Sirius said. "Now hush. Checkpoint."</p>
<p>The checkpoint by that ridiculous fountain was mostly empty, just a very junior auror sitting with his chin on his palm like he was half a second away from falling asleep on his post. Either just got up or just shy of ending his shift. Sirius remembered those days, not fondly at all. Worst job in the place, wand-check duty.</p>
<p>"Name?" the auror, one Penworthy, muttered.</p>
<p>"Sirius Black," Sirius said. He smiled as the kid's head snapped up. "Croaker released me from Azkaban as I haven't had a trial at all. I'm here to answer some questions for him. Oh, and I'd like my wand back, please. Do let him know I'm here."</p>
<p>Penworthy stared at Sirius for a long, long moment. For about three seconds, Sirius thought he was going to have to run for it and then have Crow pop him away. Then the lights turned on behind Penworthy's eyes and he visibly decided that first, this was above his pay grade, second that he was too tired to cope with it, and third, someone else of more rank was going to have to deal with Sirius. Not him.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir," Penworthy said as he passed Sirius a badge. "I imagine your wand will be in Evidence, but you'll want to check with Madame Bones on that. She's been on a rampage, going through all the files for the last twenty years or so. Croaker should still be in his office unless he's got another way out."</p>
<p>Sirius grinned and attached the badge to his robe. "Oh, I've no doubt that he does but you'd never know it. Probably would send someone out as Croaker just to keep the secret."</p>
<p>Penworthy blinked several times and nodded slowly before directing Sirius to the lifts. He waited until the doors shut to breathe a huge sigh of relief. Crow patted Sirius' hip, her fingers shaking as she clutched his trousers. Good to know that he wasn't the only one about to fly into a panic over this stunt.</p>
<p>"Amelia first," Sirius said, breathing in and out before pushing the lift button. "Then Croaker."</p>
<p>"Master Sirius should still be going home," Crow said. "Kreacher is going to be beating Crow about the head and shoulders with her own limbs for not stopping Master Sirius."</p>
<p>"Hey, I'm the Patriarch," Sirius said, finding Crow's shoulder and gently squeezing it. Odd with her invisible this way but he was getting unreasonably fond of Crow. She had a sense of humor that was a perfect match for Sirius. "You have to do things when I order you to."</p>
<p>"Master Sirius is trying to tell Kreacher that," Crow announced as the lift slowed. "Crow will have a camera ready so everyone can see the results of that."</p>
<p>"Mean," Sirius said, grinning. "I might, just to see what he does. Brace yourself. This is probably going to be terrible. Make sure you pay attention to how many get the shimmer in their eyes. And who. That's the most important thing about this entire stunt."</p>
<p>"Crow is ready," Crow promised. "And Crow is going to get a camera, just you wait. Crow will do it!"</p>
<p>He laughed a little and then tugged his waistcoat down again as the doors slid open on a room full of aurors getting ready for their day. Here's hoping he didn't die. It was far too soon for Harry to be the Black Family Patriarch.</p>
<p>Not that he'd be half bad at it. He already had the politics down better than Sirius ever would.</p>
<p>Sirius strode out of the lift, braced for dozens of wands pointed straight at him.</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>There was a letter in Harry's box when he woke up in the morning. He'd woken early, far earlier than he expected, but that was because his letter box had vibrated under his hand. Harry woke with a book on his chest, his letter box by his side and Kreacher frowning at him from the foot of the bed.</p>
<p>"Master, this is not a good place," Kreacher said in a much more gravelly voice than normal.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I noticed," Harry said. </p>
<p>He sat up and waved for Kreacher to come sit with him so that he could share magic with Kreacher. The light coming from underneath his bed's curtains was dim and grey. Still pre-dawn then. What was going on that he was getting a letter this soon?</p>
<p>"What happened?" Harry asked as Kreacher sighed with relief and set to work straightening out Harry's books for him.</p>
<p>"Master is to read his letter," Kreacher said. "Kreacher is not happy, but Kreacher was told not to say anything. Kreacher is not saying anything. Nothing at all."</p>
<p>Harry raised an eyebrow, but Kreacher just shook his head. The letter was from Sirius but there wasn't just Sirius' letter. There was a letter from Remus and Aunt Petunia and Mr. Swashlin and a very thick one from Silverclaw. He started with Sirius' very brief letter.</p>
<p>"He's fine, don't worry, everything is going great?" Harry asked Kreacher because that was literally all the letter said.</p>
<p>"Master Sirius is determined not to worry Master Harry," Kreacher grumbled. "Master Sirius is being an idiot. Like always."</p>
<p>"Did Dumbledore try to get him arrested like Mr. Swashlin was worried?" Harry asked even though he was already opening all the other letters.</p>
<p>Remus' letter was full of reassurances that he was taking care of Sirius who was an idiot and that Harry shouldn't worry. Curses weren't that big of a deal. Harry squeaked over that and went to Aunt Petunia's letter which had a mixture of news and some very snippy comments on Sirius' ability to use common sense when dealing with people who wanted him dead.</p>
<p>Dudley was at Smeltings and having a grand time, apparently. Uncle Vernon was working with Anthony again because Anthony had had to go back to work full time despite the legal issues regarding Sirius' imprisonment not having been fully resolved. Amelia Bones was working on it, though, so that would be fine. She did not explain just what had happened to get Sirius cursed and 'just fine'.</p>
<p>Mr. Swashlin did, thank goodness. Apparently, Sirius had gotten it into his head to go to the Ministry to demand his old wand back. An old auror named Mad-Eye Moody had seen him, overreacted and cursed Sirius in a fierce battle that had gotten his wooden leg broken, Sirius' shoulder broken so badly that he needed to have the bones regrown and then Amelia Bones had threatened to beat them both to death with their own limbs right in the middle of the Ministry's atrium.</p>
<p>Silverclaw's report was detailed, lovely and a thing of wonder. And confusion. Because apparently the missing money that should've gone to Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon for his care had actually been funneled into an account that had been disbursing it to the Minister of Magic, one Molly Weasley and to three more accounts that had yet to be identified because the true owners were hidden behind multiple layers of false names, fake accounts and side-stepping transfers that Silverclaw was determined to figure out.</p>
<p>"Is Molly Weasley a relative of Ron, Fred, George, and Percy Weasley's?" Harry asked Kreacher.</p>
<p>Kreacher nodded. "Mother."</p>
<p>"…Why?" Harry asked even though he could feel that Kreacher had no clue. "No, never mind. I'm glad I know. You have the unenviable task of going back to Black Castle and telling Sirius that I'm going to cry if he gets hurt again."</p>
<p>Kreacher's eyes went wide. His ears went up and out and then he started snickering. "Kreacher will do it. Can Kreacher be sad and mournful and tell Master Sirius that Master Harry is very upset?"</p>
<p>"You can," Harry said. He rubbed his tummy. "Because I am, actually. I mean, I'm not crying now or anything, but I'm kind of nauseous and not just because of the horrible magic here. Speaking of which, what do I do about the elves here? They're so unhappy and sick feeling, Kreacher!"</p>
<p>"Master Harry is a very good master," Kreacher said as he patted Harry's knee with a fond and tolerant expression.</p>
<p>"That's not helpful," Harry complained.</p>
<p>"Master Harry cannot fix it," Kreacher said with a little shrug. "Master Harry is not master of Gryffindor magics yet."</p>
<p>"That!" Harry said, pointing at Kreacher so sharply that Kreacher jumped. "The Sorting Hat said something about that. It said I needed to claim the Gryffindor something-or-other as soon as possible but I didn't really understand what it meant."</p>
<p>"Gryffindor magics is not the same magics as Potter or Black magics," Kreacher said, head tilted so far to the side that he looked like Hedwig when she was confused by something Harry did. "They is not claimed for many generations. Master Harry can claim them. No Potter has, not since last daughter of Gryffindor married into family, but they could. Gryffindor magics is waiting patiently for a Potter to do so. Then castle belongs to you, elves belong to you, and Master Harry can kick bad Dumbledore and rotten school out of castle."</p>
<p>Harry was all on board with that idea until the last little bit. Then he sat and stared at Kreacher for a long, long moment.</p>
<p>"I think I need to talk to people before I do that," Harry said. "Can you tell Aunt Petunia about that? And Anthony and Lacey and Sirius, once he's healed, and Remus, too? I'll send a letter to Silverclaw about it. I kind of think that's not something I should do without warning everyone."</p>
<p>Kreacher nodded and patted Harry's knee again. "Master Harry is very wise for his age. Very wise. Kreacher will do. Go back to sleep. Is not morning yet."</p>
<p>He popped away before Harry could say that he was far too awake for going back to sleep. Which he was. Dramatically too awake. Harry shook his head and got to work writing letters. One for Silverclaw, thanking him for the wonderful detailed report and asking that he continue working on it. He made sure to add the whole 'what to do about the Gryffindor magic' question on the end.</p>
<p>Then he wrote a detailed letter to Aunt Petunia about the whole Sorting Hat imposing blocks issue and the Gryffindor magic problem he had to solve. By that time the light coming under his curtains was brightening towards dawn, so Harry dashed off a quick note to Remus and Sirius, just saying that he'd gotten into Gryffindor and that he was a little appalled that they'd not warned him about all the sex the upper years were having behind closed doors. It should make Sirius laugh and Remus blush, just what they both needed with Sirius injured that way.</p>
<p>Ron was still snoring when Harry opened his curtains. It was kind of amazing just how loud he was. Seamus and Dean were mumbling and grumbling their way through gathering their bath things. Neville was already gone. Harry grabbed his things and hurried to the boys' bath which was already busy with upper year boys who looked either bright and eager for school to start or so exhausted that they must've gotten almost no sleep.</p>
<p>"Is he still snoring?" Neville asked Harry once they were both done showering and were working on tying their ties, in Neville's case, and fighting with his hair, in Harry's case.</p>
<p>"Ron?" Harry asked as he groaned through removing all the tangles that'd formed overnight and then rolled his eyes when his hair refused to lie flat no matter how he brushed it. "Yeah, he was. He sleeps like a log."</p>
<p>By the time they got back to their room together, Seamus and Dean were up. Ron was the one mumbling and grumbling, mostly because the twins were there with huge grins on their faces as they hauled Ron out of bed by one arm and the opposite ankle.</p>
<p>"He really does sleep like a log," Neville commented once the twins had dragged Ron off to the showers. "I hope we don't have to do that."</p>
<p>"I think I'll let the twins handle him," Harry said. "I got letters already."</p>
<p>Neville brightened up and joined Harry on his bed. He frowned through all of the letters, none of which were really private, so Harry didn't mind sharing them. Silverclaw's letter had Neville looking hopelessly lost until he got to the part about Molly Weasley.</p>
<p>"She wouldn't be part of it," Neville whispered, eyes wide. His hands shook on the letter.</p>
<p>"All of her kids, including Ron, are already blocked," Harry said. He took the letter and smoothed it out, then folded it and put it away when the door opened.</p>
<p>Fred stuck his head in.</p>
<p>"Ickle Ronnikins is awake," Fred announced with a wicked grin.</p>
<p>"…I'm never, ever going to sleep late if that's how you wake people up," Harry said. He grinned when George pushed into the room, laughing. "Um, do you have a quick moment?"</p>
<p>"The…" Fred waved at his head vaguely.</p>
<p>"That plus this," Harry said. He retrieved the page of the letter that mentioned that Molly had gotten some of the money that was supposed to go to him.</p>
<p>George and Fred put their heads together to read it, arms wrapped around each other so that each held one side of the letter. It was strangely like the two of them were one mind shared between two bodies for a moment. Then George jerked back, cursing under his breath and Fred shuddered, taking the letter from his twin.</p>
<p>"Mom makes potions," Fred said without meeting Harry's eyes. "She's really good. Almost had a mastery when she got pregnant with Bill, our oldest brother."</p>
<p>"We're not allowed in her private lab," George agreed. He ran his fingers through his hair and pulled, hard. "Never even heard a peep of what she creates. She won't let us study her books or anything. Dad's fine with it, all bland and passive about it."</p>
<p>"Remus had potions that were keeping him in line," Harry said. He took the page of the letter back from Fred. "And both Sirius and Remus had charms, spells and potions affecting them. Maybe that's what it was. She was hired to make things for the person doing it."</p>
<p>Neville shuddered. Given that George looked like wanted to kill someone and Fred looked like he wanted to die, Harry couldn't blame him. Harry, on the other hand, frowned at the list of unknown accounts.</p>
<p>"Can one person, say, a wizard, create potions, charms, mind control spells and curses?" Harry asked.</p>
<p>"Nah, doesn't work that way," Fred said. He waved his wand at Ron's bed and it made itself so that he could sit down.</p>
<p>"I want to know that spell," Harry declared, prompting Neville into startled giggles and both twins into grins. "Seriously. That's brilliant."</p>
<p>"The elves normally get the beds," George said.</p>
<p>"They're not strong," Harry replied with a fierce frown. "I don't want to tax them if I don't have to. At least not until I figure out what to do about the Gryffindor magic."</p>
<p>He got three minutes into explaining that, otherwise known as not far enough to make sense, when Ron, Seamus and Dean returned from the bathroom. Fred and George teased Ron, joked with Seamus and Dean and then disappeared into the hallway singing a silly little ditty about breakfast.</p>
<p>"I suppose we should go eat," Neville said.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I'm starving," Ron complained. </p>
<p>He shrugged into his robe, fidgeted until he almost got it settled right and them made a face when Harry and Neville both mimed the little lift and shift the shoulders thing that Draco had shown him.</p>
<p>"Fine," Ron said as he did it and immediately looked a hundred percent less rumpled. "Don't know why I have to follow a slimy snake's instructions."</p>
<p>"It's so you don't look like you just rolled out of bed," Seamus drawled, his accent extra-thick. "Though I see Harry's given up on his hair."</p>
<p>Harry groaned.</p>
<p>"He brushed it!" Neville exclaimed, grinning at Harry's mock-swat at his shoulder. "A bunch. His hair just bounced back and looked like that when he was done."</p>
<p>"My hair never obeys," Harry complained. </p>
<p>He put his letter box away, grabbed his bookbag and the Important Things to Learn library trunk. Strapping on his holster prompted everyone else, except Ron, to strap on theirs. Ron grimaced as he fidgeted with his wand.</p>
<p>"That looks really old," Harry said of Ron's wand.</p>
<p>"Yeah, my family couldn't afford a new one for me," Ron said. His cheeks were bright red, and he glared at Harry and Neville as if it was their fault.</p>
<p>"My Gran wouldn't get me one," Neville said. He nodded to Harry. "Harry gave me a wand from his vaults and it works way better."</p>
<p>"I found a bunch," Harry said. He pulled out one of the wands that didn't work at all for him. "Try it."</p>
<p>Ron took it and got a weak spray of sparks. The second one that didn't work barely glowed at the tip. Harry's grandfather's wand swelled with power, but it made Ron's hair stand on end. His grandmother's didn't work at all. Harry ran through all the wands until he got to the one that Ollivander sold him.</p>
<p>"Last one I've got," Harry said, giving it to Ron to try.</p>
<p>Magic swirled around Ron. Not like he was doing it but like the wand was assessing him. It died out after a moment that left Ron panting and staring at the wand.</p>
<p>"Darn," Harry said, taking the wand back and holstering it as quickly as possible because it was still horrible to touch. "Sorry. I hoped that one of them might work."</p>
<p>"I've got a couple," Neville said. He grinned at Harry's startled look. "Gran felt guilty and let me go through the vaults, too. I found four wands. Want to try one?"</p>
<p>"Uh, sure," Ron said though he didn't exactly look excited about the idea.</p>
<p>The first two didn't work. At all. One of them Ron barely touched before he was shoving it back into Neville's hand. The third one was perfect. Harry could feel it. He could feel the Weasley magic linking into the wand, shoving at the blocks on Ron's magic and mind.</p>
<p>Harry grabbed Ron's arm. Neville grabbed Ron, too. They both pushed magic into Ron to help the Weasley family magic and the wand snap the bonds on Ron's magic. Ron shouted and nearly fell down even though Seamus and Dean caught him from behind as his legs gave way.</p>
<p>"What the bloody hell was that?" Ron demanded. He stared at the wand, then at Harry and Neville. "What is it? It's so angry."</p>
<p>"That's the Weasley family magic," Harry said. "It's a long story. Someone blocked you from feeling it. I don't know why but the Weasley magic is super-mad about being blocked from all of you. The twins are free. Now you are, too. We're gonna try and free everyone else."</p>
<p>He pulled out one of the amulets and slung it over Ron's neck. Ron gasped and clapped his free hand over the charm. It seemed to help because he managed to stand up properly after a second.</p>
<p>"That'll help," Harry said. "Don't tell any upper years or teachers. All the upper years are blocked. I bet most if not all the teachers are, too. You'll probably be less hungry all the time now, too."</p>
<p>"This…" Ron shuddered and nodded. "Right. Yeah. Okay, I'll… stay quiet. But. Um, you'll explain?"</p>
<p>"Once I'm sure it won't get us all in trouble, yeah," Harry said. "I promise."</p>
<p>Ron accepted that with a little nod. He headed for the door, still shaking. Seamus and Dean followed, though Seamus looked at Harry with a frown that would've meant trouble if it was Dudley's old friends. Hopefully that wouldn't happen here. Hopefully.</p>
<p>"Breakfast?" Neville suggested.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Harry said. "I want to ask Hermione to see what she can find out about the Gryffindor magic. I bet the Ravenclaws have an awesome library."</p>
<p>Neville laughed and shook his head. "You and your libraries. Let's go. I am hungry."</p>
<p>"Me, too," Harry agreed.</p>
<p>He wasn't terribly excited about having to deal with Dumbledore watching him at breakfast, but food sounded good. Food and a book to read sounded better. Food and a book and answers of what to do next would be the best thing ever.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>"It's a pity that young Ron Weasley is so different from his brothers," Minerva complained to Filius as they made their way to the Great Hall for breakfast. "The twins had to literally drag him out of bed by his ankles this morning. I was ready to scold them quite severely, but Percy told me that it was normal. Normal! That boy's going to be a disgrace if he doesn't settle in."</p>
<p>Filius nodded quietly. He'd not said a single word all morning and they'd had early tea in the staff room while going over all the lesson plans together before coming to breakfast. He really was a huge help. Minerva couldn't have done all the work Albus shifted onto her without Filius' help.</p>
<p>"Are you all right?" Minerva asked Filius. "You're unusually quiet today."</p>
<p>"Ah, my apologies," Filius said with a wry little smile. "First day for the Ravenclaws. You know how it is. I had to chase them off the lending library shelves sixteen times before they'd all go to bed. I've several very bright new students. I think you'll like Miss Granger. A very bright Lumos, that one. Quite the contrast to your Weasley."</p>
<p>"Goodness, we should keep them apart then," Minerva complained. "Young Mr. Weasley was complaining about having to get up for class. He seemed to think that classes should not actually start for another week or two."</p>
<p>"Oh dear," Filius said with enough amusement that Minerva chuckled along with him. "Yes, I do think we should keep them apart. How was our Mr. Potter?"</p>
<p>Minerva hummed as she settled in her place, Filius by her side. While Minerva always sat in the same place, Filius insisted on switching seats for every meal. He rarely ever sat in the same place twice. There was no pattern to his movements that she'd ever been able to detect. He just seemed to enjoy conversation with everyone at the school.</p>
<p>"He's… genial," Minerva said. "A rather strange blend of Lily and James, actually. Very smart. I'm rather astonished he didn't end up in Ravenclaw. He has three personal library trunks, Filius. Three!"</p>
<p>"Goodness!" Filius said with enough delight that Minerva had to hide her grin from the students stumbling by taking a sip of her tea. "I wonder if he'd allow me to see the catalog of his books."</p>
<p>"I think he probably would," Minerva said.</p>
<p>Albus wasn't there yet, more's the pity. Minerva had a great many things to say to him about his abandonment yesterday and the horrible way he'd treated poor Hagrid, too. But then, she always had things to say to Albus and somehow, he always seemed to escape her lectures.</p>
<p>"Minerva," Filius murmured low enough that she almost missed the comment, "I'd suggest being checked for potions and compulsions in the next couple of days."</p>
<p>She turned to stare at him but Filius was focused on adding a ridiculous amount of lemon to his tea. "Why?"</p>
<p>"Mmm, it's… advisable," Filius said without meeting her eyes at all. "It's the season for it at Gringotts. A good time to make a trip into London, really. Perhaps this weekend."</p>
<p>"I have so much to do…" Minerva started to say.</p>
<p>Her voice trailed off in the face of Filius' grim look. She would have asked more but Albus breezed in as the final few students, Ron Weasley included, slouched to their places at the tables. Another time, perhaps. He must have a reason for such an odd suggestion. She'd just have to make a note of it for later, perhaps this evening after the children went to bed.</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>Breakfast was another banquet full of food that looked and tasted amazing. Harry's charm warned him about the bacon, which was a tragedy, the pumpkin juice which didn't bother him at all, and the porridge. He ate eggs and ham and toast smeared with a thick layer of rhubarb preserves.</p>
<p>Neville avoided the pumpkin juice. All the first years and the twins did, too. Even Ron avoided it with a wary expression and a light touch to the charm around his neck. No one else avoided the bacon so Harry stole a rasher from Neville who huffed and mock-glared at him for it.</p>
<p>The plates had just been cleared away when Professor McGonagall showed up with their class schedules. There was no map. Harry frowned.</p>
<p>"Um, Professor?" Harry asked. </p>
<p>He didn't flinch away from her stern look. It was very impressive but not as impressive as Aunt Petunia facing down her bridge party when someone had thoroughly inappropriate gossip to share.</p>
<p>"Yes, Mr. Potter?" Professor McGonagall asked. She looked over the rim of her square glasses at him as if she expected him to spout nonsense.</p>
<p>"I was wondering if there's a map?" Harry said. "The school's quite large and I'm certain I'm going to get lost without one."</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter, the upper years will escort you to class for the first week," Professor McGonagall said much more severely and with a rather faded twinkle in her eyes. "I'm sure by that point you'll have figured it out."</p>
<p>"Ah," Harry said. He stared at her until the twinkle faded. "I see. Well, is there a map anywhere? I don't want to mistakenly go to the third-floor corridor that Headmaster Dumbledore warned us about."</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah," Seamus said. "I'd really like to avoid a gruesome death, ma'am. Me mam would be right upset if I died my first year."</p>
<p>Neville nodded his agreement as did Dean and Lavender Brown who clutched her hands to her chest and made sad puppy eyes at Professor McGonagall. The twinkle resurfaced only to fade a moment later. Interesting. Maybe she was working her way free of it? That could be helpful.</p>
<p>"The library does have maps of the school," Professor McGonagall said. "You're free to study them when you're not in class but right now you'd best be off or you won't make it to class in time. Go on, now. Scoot!"</p>
<p>They scooted. The twins made a point of escorting Harry, or more realistically, tormenting Ron by escorting Harry. They made it to Transfiguration in time, not much thanks to the moving staircases or the twins who tried to stop and point out every sculpture, painting and suit of armor along the way. They grinned and ran off when they finally arrived at the classroom.</p>
<p>Ron ended up on one side of Harry. Neville was on the other. From the way Ron cradled his new wand, he expected someone to take it away at any moment.</p>
<p>"It makes me feel so different," Ron murmured.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's not the wand," Harry said, just as quietly. "I couldn't tell you on the train, but something here has been putting blocks on people's magic. And their minds. You were reacting kind of like my cousin Dudley."</p>
<p>Ron stared at Harry. "What kind of name is Dudley?"</p>
<p>His horror set Harry to snickering just as a cat with square markings around its eyes marched in. It transformed mid-step into Professor McGonagall which made Harry gape in awe. He'd read, briefly, about Animagus after Remus told him about the spell but he'd never imagined that he'd see it happen with anyone but Sirius.</p>
<p>Who, honestly, was still too weak to do it. Especially with a broken shoulder, the reckless idiot.</p>
<p>"Good morning, children," Professor McGonagall said. "In this class you will be learning the art of transfiguration, the transformation of one object or creature into another."</p>
<p>Her lecture was light on details of what the ethical and magical limits of transfiguration were, which Harry scribbled into his notes as a thing to follow up on. It was also very, very basic on their first attempt to transfigure things. Changing a matchstick into a needle was not as easy as it seemed like it should be, but every single one of them managed it after a few tries.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall seemed stunned by that.</p>
<p>"Ma'am," Harry said, holding his hand up, "I was wondering, um, do you have any recommendations on further reading? I was kind of concerned about the ethical issues of transfiguration."</p>
<p>"Ethical?" Professor McGonagall asked with far too much confusion and a very strong twinkle in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Well, yes," Harry said as earnestly as he could. "You said that you could transform a creature, an animal, into something else. Like transforming Ron's rat Scabbers into a teacup or something. That seems… not so good? I mean, does it hurt the animal? Are they aware of themselves while trapped in inanimate form? I don't want to hurt anyone if I can help it."</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall shook her head so sharply that her glasses slid down her nose and then blew out a sharp breath. The twinkle abruptly left her eyes, leaving them glowing with a bright red-gold light. The first glow that Harry had seen out of any of the Hogwarts professors. Or the students, now that he thought about it. Even the first years hadn't shown any glowing eyes or vibrating voices or shifting hair while waiting for the Sorting.</p>
<p>How very odd.</p>
<p>"A very good question and one that I normally don't address until third year, Mr. Potter," Professor McGonagall said. She smiled rather proudly at him. "Ten points to Gryffindor for forward thinking. I'll bring you a list of supplementary reading next class."</p>
<p>"I'd love to have it, too," Draco said from the table he'd staked out with Blaise and Pansy.</p>
<p>Everyone else nodded their agreement, other than Ron who looked a little horrified by the thought of doing more studying than he had to. Professor McGonagall's breath caught as she grinned, suddenly looking decades younger and much less stern.</p>
<p>"I'll bring copies for everyone, but you'll have to share the books," Professor McGonagall said. "There's only a single copy of each in the library."</p>
<p>"I think I might have to order some books," Harry said and then laughed when Ron, Neville, Seamus, Dean, Blaise, Pansy and Draco all groaned at him. He shrugged at Professor McGonagall's curious look. "I like books."</p>
<p>"You may look like your father, Mr. Potter, but you're the very soul of your mother," Professor McGonagall said. "Off to your next class now. A prefect should be waiting to escort you."</p>
<p>One was. After each class, one of the older students or a prefect was there to show them where to go. Herbology was lovely. Harry and Neville had a grand time talking about their favorite plants. Neville had a lot of experience with magical plants while Harry knew tons about mundane ones, so they paired up and enjoyed themselves tremendously.</p>
<p>Flying was rather frightening. The booms all felt very old, nearly as old as the wand that couldn't be used back in the Potter vaults or Ron's original wand. They still worked, barely, but Harry wouldn't want to try anything hazardous on them. Draco looked as nervous about them as Harry, grumbling under his breath about his father would hear about this every time his broom failed to respond instantly to his commands.</p>
<p>Thankfully, no one was hurt during the lesson and they all got to head back inside for Potions.</p>
<p>"I'm looking forward to this one," Draco announced with a little puff to his chest and a grin of delight. "Mother's been tutoring me on potions for years."</p>
<p>"I've been dreading it," Neville groaned. "I'm pants at potions. I always have been."</p>
<p>"Which teacher is it?" Harry asked, having forgotten to look at the schedule what with the map question and the stairs and everything else today.</p>
<p>"Snape," Draco said. "Severus Snape. He's my godfather."</p>
<p>"Oh," Harry said, eyes wide as he stared at Draco. "My mum knew him. Aunt Petunia really, truly does not like him even after all these years."</p>
<p>Draco's jaw dropped open as he stared at Harry. He didn't have a chance to reply because Professor Snape swept into the room like a storm cloud. His nose was a beak. His hair was black and greasy and it hung about his forehead and cheeks in ways that made Harry want to sic Kreacher on him. His robe was at least three sizes too big for him and made him look like a scarecrow.</p>
<p>He paused and sneered at Harry. "Mr. Potter, our resident celebrity."</p>
<p>"So I've been told, Professor," Harry said. He shrugged. "Though we are suing the people who wrote those books. They were all created and sold without licensing, permission or any connection to the truth."</p>
<p>Professor Snape's head went back and he frowned as if that was the last thing he'd expected to hear from Harry. Perhaps it was. Aunt Petunia was never kind when she spoke about Snape. Remus had been a bit kinder when he talked about Snape but he'd made it perfectly clear that Harry could never trust Snape or be safe with him.</p>
<p>Snape had apparently stalked his mum her entire life and still, a decade later, hadn't stopped pining for her.</p>
<p>It was dreadfully creepy and Harry had no intention of trusting a single thing that came out of Professor Snape's mouth. He might have to have classes with the man but that wasn't going to last very long if Snape decided to bully Harry. He'd find a way to get Snape sacked. Somehow. Probably.</p>
<p>"I'm sure you'll get your profit somehow," Professor Snape finally snapped at Harry.</p>
<p>"Won't take a penny of it," Harry said. "I just want them to stop lying about me."</p>
<p>"I'm stunned that you would care, given your lineage," Professor Snape said with all the viciousness of Piers, Dudley's former best friend, when he was working himself up to a Harry Hunting.</p>
<p>Harry blinked at Professor Snape, slowly smiling. The entire room stilled. Draco caught Harry's sleeve, shaking his arm very gently. It was like he was afraid to catch Professor Snape's attention. Or to ruin Harry's focus.</p>
<p>Harry laughed, as much like Remus' soft, quiet laughs as possible. He let his eyes glow green, the same green his mum had. Professor Snape paled, clutching his desk with one hand that went white at the knuckles.</p>
<p>"Aunt Petunia warned me about you," Harry said with a little smile. Professor Snape jerked at Aunt Petunia's name. "She remembers everything about you."</p>
<p>"What?" Professor Snape's voice was very harsh and very high-pitched. He licked his lips.</p>
<p>"Everything," Harry repeated with a slightly wider smile. "I'll have to tell her that you haven't changed at all. Should I tell you what she says about that?"</p>
<p>"Take your books out!" Professor Snape ordered as he whirled and started writing on the board.</p>
<p>He didn't look Harry in the eyes the entire rest of class. Professor Snape was very, very careful not to go anywhere near Harry. His lesson was so abrupt that only Draco did a good job on the potion. Everyone else simply didn't have enough information to do what they needed to.</p>
<p>"Why didn't he explain about the difference in crushing versus cutting?" Draco ranted as they all, both Slytherin and Gryffindor, headed up to the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom. "It's one of the most important lessons of all. And stirring! You have to be very careful how you stir, which direction, how long, what stirrer you use. Nothing. He gave everyone absolutely nothing they needed to succeed."</p>
<p>"Yeah," Seamus drawled, "but that's because Harry scared the piss out of him."</p>
<p>"I kind of did," Harry agreed. He grinned at Seamus' cackle and Draco's glare. "No, really. I did. I mean, I know you think Aunt Marge is worse but Aunt Petunia is much scarier than Aunt Marge. Aunt Marge just lectures at you. Aunt Petunia is terrifying."</p>
<p>"She really is," Neville agreed. "She argued Gran into shutting up. And got Amelia Bones to rescue Sirius."</p>
<p>"No one messes with Aunt Petunia," Harry said with all the seriousness that it deserved. It was, after all, as serious a rule as the law of gravity.</p>
<p>Draco shook his head and went on grumbling as they made their way from the dungeons up to the third floor on the left-hand side. The right-hand side across the central area with its moving staircases didn't look dangerous. There were a bunch of doors and corridors leading off down into a different wing. From where they were, it looked perfectly normal.</p>
<p>Harry could feel a drift of magic that was outright wrong coming from the area, though. He pursed his lips. As much as he wanted to know what was down there, he absolutely wasn't going to go exploring. What he was going to do was send Silverclaw, Aunt Petunia, Sirius and Remus a letter about it.</p>
<p>"Remind me to tell Susan to send her aunt a letter about the third-floor corridor," Harry told Neville as they headed into the DADA classroom. "I bet her aunt will have a lot to say about that."</p>
<p>The room stank of garlic. It was so thick that Harry's eyes watered which was really, really bad given how much Harry loved garlic. Draco started coughing immediately and Neville wheezed, his eyes watering.</p>
<p>"G-good morning, ch-ch-children," Professor Quirrell said from the head of the room. "P-p-p-please t-take y-your seats."</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Lacey didn't drop her jaw as she walked into the room where the goblins were storing Voldemort's stupid horcruxes. It was a near thing. She'd never felt wards like that before, despite having studied in Rome after Beauxbatons. They were a palpable presence, cascading over her body in a waterfall of power that first checked her identity, then whether her mind was clear and then, as she stepped into the chamber proper past the heavy airlock doors, purified her of all outside influences.</p>
<p>Small price to have to renew her contraceptive and menstrual charms to be that sure that neither Dumbledore nor Voldemort had influenced her.</p>
<p>"Wow," Lacey murmured to Silverclaw.</p>
<p>Silverclaw smirked. "We take no chances with these… items."</p>
<p>"I'm glad," Lacey said with a snort of amusement. "Lord knows, the Ministry would toss them in a cardboard box and leave them on an unguarded shelf in an open corridor."</p>
<p>"I can see them doing exactly that," Silverclaw replied. He shuddered like someone'd just cut a galleon in half and revealed that it was filled with tin.</p>
<p>Lacey would have grinned, maybe teased Silverclaw a bit. She liked the grumpy, prideful, vain goblin. Anyone who went to Silverclaw's efforts to protect a child was a good person in her estimation.</p>
<p>Ragnok, Chieftain of the Goblins, strode in after them.</p>
<p>"Chieftain," Lacey said with a very proper bob of her head and a tight-lipped smile. "You honor us."</p>
<p>"Yes, I do," Ragnok declared. His eyes lingered an almost indecently long time on Silverclaw's claws before narrowing as he turned to the table with all the horcruxes. "What do we have?"</p>
<p>Six other goblins came in behind Ragnok, each of them in bespoke tailored suits with perfect hand-stitched pinstripes and silk ties that were worth as much as Lacey's entire wardrobe. They all held mithril or silver or platinum staves bedecked with perfectly cut jewels.</p>
<p>Every single one of them locked eyes on Silverclaw for just a little bit too long.</p>
<p>All right, then. Silverclaw did have reason to be vain. She'd never realized that goblins actually had distinct measures of attractiveness before. A thing to note and maybe tell Narcissa. No one else other than Harry and Petunia would find it interesting.</p>
<p>Hmm. She'd best ask Silverclaw later if there were any books on goblin aesthetics so that she could give it to Harry when she told him. He'd just pester her with endless questions otherwise.</p>
<p>Once the other goblins had looked their fill, Silverclaw cleared his throat and approached the table. A very serious ward shimmered into life before he could go in touching range. Ragnok didn't look at all upset by the delay to getting his question answered, maybe because it let him stare at Silverclaw a little longer than was at all proper.</p>
<p>"Voldemort was born Tom Marvolo Riddle," Silverclaw stated, bowing his head slightly to Lacey when she choked and stared at him. "This was discovered earlier today through interaction with the diary. He created five horcruxes with the intent of creating one more. It was his belief that if he slivered is soul into seven pieces, he would be immune from death."</p>
<p>"…He was an idiot," Lacey said, shaking her head.</p>
<p>The mage-goblins nodded their agreement, a couple of them curling their lips to expose sharp teeth.</p>
<p>"Very much so," Silverclaw said. "The diary was the first. It took two attempts. The first attempt resulted in the death of a young woman at Hogwarts. The second, very shortly afterwards, was successful. He chose his own family for the sacrifices to the ceremony's requirements. The second piece of his soul is in the Gaunt family ancestral ring, inherited from his mother’s family as last of line. Next was Helga Hufflepuff's cup. Then Rowena Ravenclaw's diadem was used. Each was hidden in distinct places that would be nearly impossible to discern, had we not had carte blanche to search all Black and Potter properties from Heir Potter."</p>
<p>"Where were they?" Ragnok asked before Lacey could do so. </p>
<p>She hadn't even realized Harry had given that order. Anthony must have forgotten to tell her about it.</p>
<p>"The diary came from Lucius Malfoy after Heir Potter saved him," Silverclaw said. "That gave us the signature to search for. We found the cup in Bellatrix Lestrange's vault. Heavy fines were levied for bringing an unauthorized and unprotected horcrux into the bank."</p>
<p>"Does she have anything left in her vault?" Lacey asked more out of curiosity than anything else.</p>
<p>"No," Silverclaw said. </p>
<p>His smug little smile made Ragnok and the mage-goblins shift like Anthony when he was around any of the Delacour sisters. Okay, really attractive by goblin standards. She pursed her lips rather than grinning at that tidbit of knowledge.</p>
<p>"Good," Lacey said instead.</p>
<p>"The locket was delivered by Kreacher," Silverclaw continued, holding up a hand when Lacey gasped, worried for Kreacher. "Heir Potter took care of Kreacher immediately after. He is thriving now. Due to Heir Potter being the Heir of Gryffindor and his giving us carte blanche, we were able to contact the house elves of Hogwarts. They directed our strike team to the Room of Requirement. We were able to retrieve the diadem while Dumbledore was in the will reading and while the other teachers were busy preparing the school for the students. You, personally, saw the retrieval of the soul shard that had been contained in Heir Potter's scar."</p>
<p>"We have all the pieces of Voldemort's soul, then," Ragnok said with a little growl that was a lot like the one Marge's horrible dog got just before he got a treat.</p>
<p>"All but one," Silverclaw agreed. "We are here to discuss the best ritual to use to draw Voldemort's soul out of its hiding place so that we can destroy all the pieces at once."</p>
<p>"That's not exactly going to be easy," Lacey said, gnawing on her thumbnail. "If he's anchored himself somewhere else, especially if he's found himself a willing host, it's going to be almost impossible."</p>
<p>Silverclaw's smirk grew. "It would be, yes, however Voldemort was truly an idiot. The Gaunt ring holds the Resurrection Stone of legend. We can free it from the horcrux and then use the Stone to draw Voldemort to us. In fact, it may be possible to free all the artifacts from their corrupting horcruxes and then summon the final shard of Voldemort's soul. I couldn't say. I'm not a mage. That's why you're all here."</p>
<p>Lacey wasn't at all surprised that the mage-goblins pushed right past her to get up against the protective wards around the table. She wanted to shove them aside, too. What the hell? Seriously, what the hell?</p>
<p>At least they'd gotten all the pieces but one. If they were lucky, in a week or a month or so, Harry would be safe from Voldemort at last.</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>Harry frowned as he tried his best to take notes on Professor Quirrell's lecture. There wasn't much to take notes on, honestly. Professor Quirrell stammered badly. He was lucky to get one word in four out without stuttering on it. Frequently, he gave up on one word and switched to something else entirely.</p>
<p>But that wasn't the problem. The problem was that Professor Quirrell didn't tell them anything. He talked about the book but not about what was in the book. He did give them an assignment, right at the start of class, but the rest of their class was spent listening to Professor Quirrell attempt to talk about the pure-blood wizard who'd written the book and how he'd been a very daring and talented DADA master.</p>
<p>Aunt Marge would be the first to say that provenance of information was very important. Vital even. But a whole class spent just on the credentials of the textbook author? It was like Professor Quirrell hadn't even read his own textbook.</p>
<p>The weird part was that Professor Quirrell kept staring at Harry as if he expected to get some sort of response. He never asked a single question of Harry. Or of anyone else. But he'd stare at Harry with eyes that glowed blood red on a regular basis and then frown when Harry just stared back at him with his quill poised to take more notes.</p>
<p>So very strange.</p>
<p>The magic in the DADA room was such that Harry had a hard time feeling anything but his own magic. Someone, probably Quirrell, has put wards and protective spells so thickly that it was kind of hard to breathe in the room. Adding that to the overwhelming smell of garlic and Harry wasn't surprised that some of the other kids were busier blowing their noses than paying attention.</p>
<p>"M-Mr. Potter," Professor Quirrell said after he finished his lecture and let them go. "A m-moment, please."</p>
<p>"We'll be outside," Neville whispered to Harry.</p>
<p>"Leave the door open so I can breathe," Harry told Neville who nodded and did just that.</p>
<p>Harry joined Professor Quirrell at the head of the room. "Yes, Professor?"</p>
<p>"Odd," Professor Quirrell said in a silky voice that didn't stammer at all. His eyes were blood red again, bright and hostile. "I expected more from you."</p>
<p>"I expected a class worth taking notes in, sir," Harry said with a little shrug. "I suppose neither of us got what we wanted."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell's head went up and back and he snarled at Harry in ways that reminded Harry very much of Uncle Vernon back before the curses were removed. Harry frowned at him, wondering if he was cursed that way, too.</p>
<p>"Did you want something in particular, Professor?" Harry said as he offered Professor Quirrell a hand. His magic shimmered over his fingertips without Harry's meaning it to. "Another handshake? You did say you were a fan."</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell took a sharp step back. His eyes faded back to their normal indeterminant hazel-grey.</p>
<p>"N-no, that's enough, M-Mr. P-P-P-Potter. Y-you c-can g-g-g-," he stopped, took a breath and then nodded towards the door, "leave."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Professor," Harry said. "I hope that we get into the text next class. It sounds interesting, given the information you told us about the author. I'll have to read ahead."</p>
<p>Not surprisingly given how many of Harry's teachers had objected to him knowing more than he was supposed to, Professor Quirrell glared at him. He didn't say anything else which meant that Harry got to escape the room and suck great lungsful of air outside.</p>
<p>"Wow, he was not that bad when I met him before," Harry said. He shuddered at Draco and Neville, both of whom had waited for Harry. "Next class?"</p>
<p>"Next class," Draco said. He scowled at the door. "My father is going to hear about this. Ridiculous that we're expected to learn from someone who can't even speak."</p>
<p>"I object more that he doesn't seem to have opened the book before," Harry said. "Not one word about the actual subject, just stuff about pure-blood this and mastery that."</p>
<p>"You got more out of that than I did," Neville said. "I couldn't understand most of what he said when I could hear through my sneezing and blowing my nose. The garlic was horrible!"</p>
<p>He groaned and led the way back to the central staircases and the way down to their next and final class of the say. By dinnertime, Harry was grateful to be done. He had a great deal of homework to do, of course, but when he found himself in the library it wasn't to do his essays and assignments.</p>
<p>There were no books on the Founders that Harry could find.</p>
<p>"What are you looking for?" Hermione asked. She grinned at Harry's start. "Sorry, I thought you heard me coming."</p>
<p>"No, I didn't," Harry said. "Too focused, I guess. Have you seen any books on the Founders? I wanted to look up stuff on them but I can't find any books that talk about them."</p>
<p>Hermione huffed and crossed her arms over her chest as her hair bristled around her head. </p>
<p>"Professor Flitwick said that they were removed from the general section of the library a while back. About a decade or so ago? They're in the Restricted Section now. We won't be able to read them for years and even then, we'll need to get permission slips from a professor."</p>
<p>"Huh, that's odd," Harry said.</p>
<p>He could think of a bunch of reasons why it was a terrible decision. And one reason why Dumbledore would have done it. He didn't want anyone to know about the Founders so that no one could claim the Founder's magic, however that was done.</p>
<p>Harry wasn't sure how it worked, really. The Potter magic and the Black magic were just there. If the Gryffindor magic was lurking around, Harry couldn't tell. He shook his head. He'd just have to order some books on them from the goblins. It would cost more but it would be worth it, especially with Aunt Petunia, Anthony and everyone else busy trying to get Sirius either 'acquitted' or a proper trial.</p>
<p>He couldn't be truly acquitted since he'd never been convicted, not that the magical government seemed to care much about that.</p>
<p>"What about in Ravenclaw Tower?" Harry asked. "Does anyone have books on it there? Are you having fun there? What's it like?"</p>
<p>Hermione grinned, joy lighting her eyes and making her voice vibrate enticingly. "It's wonderful, Harry! Every single room has bookshelves and we can put in requests every morning. By night, the books we wanted to read are there waiting for us. It's a lending library, of course, so you only keep them for a week, but it's still lovely. They're just delivered right to you! I've got so many plans of what to study and learn."</p>
<p>"…I want a magical lending library," Harry complained in as horrible a whine as any Dudley had ever made.</p>
<p>She just laughed at him, loud at first and then with a hand over her mouth when Madame Pince glared at them both from the end of the aisle. Instead of working on the Gryffindor thing, Hermione and Harry worked through the first three chapters of the DADA book together. They quizzed each other and found backup source books for anything that wasn't clear.</p>
<p>It was wonderfully fun. Hermione was absolutely brilliant and got things incredibly quickly. Harry wasn't as smart as she was but he got the practical aspects of it faster than she did, not that either of them tried any of the spells in the library. That would be rude to the other students. Madame Pince might also throw them out and that'd be a tragedy.</p>
<p>Either way, Harry felt much more prepared for DADA by the time curfew hit and they had to go back to their respective towers. The stairs tried to deposit Harry on the third-floor right-hand side but he hung on and then stomped back down the stairs and up a different set until he managed to get to the right set of stairs leading up to Gryffindor Tower.</p>
<p>There were far too many stairs in Hogwarts. His legs were going to be killing him for ages until he got used to it. The Pink Lady, Fellona, smiled at Harry when he made it home.</p>
<p>"Good evening, Fellona," Harry said. "Any problems today?"</p>
<p>"Not a one that hasn't happened a thousand times before, Mr. Potter," Fellona said. "You'd best get to bed, young man. It's late."</p>
<p>"Agreed," Harry said. "Caput Draconis, right?"</p>
<p>"Exactly," Fellona said with a nod of approval. "Sleep well."</p>
<p>"Thank you and you, too," Harry said. He paused just before crawling into the tunnel. "I mean, if a portrait sleeps, that is."</p>
<p>"Bed!" Fellona ordered with a hearty laugh. "No dawdling, now."</p>
<p>Harry grinned and didn't dawdle at all. Seamus and Dean were already in bed, curtains drawn. Neville was just pulling his curtains when Harry walked in. He yawned and waved to Harry, flopping to his pillow as he closed the curtains.</p>
<p>Ron was still up though he was dressed in his night clothes. His new wand was in his hand. He kept stroking it as if he was afraid it would go away.</p>
<p>"It's really not the wand," Harry said. "Let me get into my night clothes and I'll explain, okay?"</p>
<p>He got no response, but Ron waited and then frowned when Harry joined Ron on his bed and pulled the drapes. Harry really wished he knew a proper privacy spell. Something that would make it impossible for Dumbledore to listen in. He didn't so there wasn't much to do about it besides just make the best of it.</p>
<p>"All right," Harry said as he sat cross-legged on the end of Ron's bed. "Let me explain the whole thing. It's a long story so it'll take a while."</p>
<p>It did take a while. Ron didn't say a single word all the way through though he started and stared, winced and shuddered more than a few times. He actually gasped that Mr. Malfoy had invited the whole Weasley clan to his home to meet Harry. Given the blood feud between the families, that wasn't exactly a normal thing for Mr. Malfoy to do.</p>
<p>Once Harry explained the whole thing, everything that he knew and understood and the stuff he only sort of understood a little bit, Ron groaned and grabbed his pillow to scream quietly into it.</p>
<p>"Um, are you all right?" Harry asked Ron.</p>
<p>"My mum is evil!" Ron exclaimed. "She has to be! She took the money that was supposed to go to you!"</p>
<p>"Well, no," Harry said thoughtfully. "She's being paid by someone evil but that just means that she was trying to support your family as best she could from home. I mean, you have a big family. It probably takes a lot to keep everyone clothed and fed. Uncle Vernon is always complaining about how much kids cost."</p>
<p>"Yeah, Mum does the same thing," Ron said with a wry smile that quickly faded into a miserable expression. "I'm really sorry, mate."</p>
<p>"Pfft, it's not your fault," Harry said. "Seriously, you were blocked and trapped. The only thing that matters now is what you do with your life. Though I am really curious why you keep stroking your wand."</p>
<p>"It… I get dreams sometimes," Ron admitted as if he expected to be teased for it. "Or say things as a joke and they come true. The wand, well, it's kind of… making it easier to see stuff? I think? I don't know how to explain it, Harry. I mean, the blocks are gone, and I can read and I'm not starving all the time, but there's something else, too. The wand helps. More than just to do magic. It's like it lets me focus on something that I can see but not with my eyes."</p>
<p>"That's wicked," Harry breathed, staring at Ron with awe. "That's as cool as Hermione's magical lending library in Ravenclaw. Maybe more cool. I'll have to see if I have any books on that."</p>
<p>Ron groaned a laugh, shaking his head at Harry. "Mate, do you have to study everything?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Harry said with a huge grin. "Yes, I do. It's fun. Besides, I don't know if we can trust any of the teachers, so books are the only choice. I've got some really old ones that might not be available elsewhere. Even in the school library. If it helps, as long as they're not out of date and inaccurate, why not? It's better than nothing."</p>
<p>"All right," Ron said with a put-upon sigh. "I'll read your books if you find them. But only on this. Not on everything!"</p>
<p>"Deal," Harry said. He grinned and offered Ron a hand.</p>
<p>Ron shook his head and took Harry's hand. "Deal."</p>
<p>The Weasley magic hummed happily to the Potter and Black magics. It was still angry and trying to free its other members, but it was very pleased that Ron was free. Harry smiled.</p>
<p>"Bedtime?" Harry asked.</p>
<p>"Yeah, definitely," Ron said. "I'm exhausted."</p>
<p>"Pull your curtains shut all the way," Harry told him and then laughed when Ron frowned. "You snore like the end of the world. The curtains are spelled to keep it quiet."</p>
<p>"Get out," Ron groaned as his cheeks went beet red. "I do not… do I?"</p>
<p>"You really do," Harry said. "Might want to see someone about it sometime. You know, when you're not at school or something. I'm not sure it'd be safe here."</p>
<p>Ron paled at that and nodded. "G'night, Harry."</p>
<p>"Goodnight, Ron," Harry said.</p>
<p>Harry tried to read one of his books before falling asleep, but the words kept blurring in front of his eyes, so he ended up setting the book aside and curling up under the covers instead. Tomorrow. He'd write Silverclaw another letter tomorrow and tell him about Ron's new gift and the lack of books on the Founders and the weird way Professor Quirrell acted. And the lack of glowing eyes. That seemed really important given the way everyone magical had glowing eyes elsewhere.</p>
<p>So many things to keep track of. Harry yawned and rubbed his cheek against the pillow. He needed to keep a diary or something to make sure he didn't forget anything. Another thing to remember tomorrow.</p>

<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p>The ritual room deep under Gringotts shimmered with magic, deep magic as alien to Lacey as the bottom of an oceanic trench would be. Her hair, loose around her face, drifted in the currents of magic filling the air. She'd been given a stunning mithril and silk robe for the ceremony, as had Anthony, Sirius and Remus. </p>
<p>Each of them had different images worked into their robes. Air with birds and butterflies and clouds for Anthony. If ever there was an accurate match of personality to type, that was it. She'd called Anthony an airhead for ages before she'd accepted her first date with him. He'd always taken the taunt with pride.</p>
<p>Remus had wolves and mountains, forests and bears, on his robe. He stood oppose Anthony, fidgeting like he wanted to shift and run. After all this was over, once they'd destroyed Voldemort and thrown Dumbledore in prison, Lacey was going to face Remus down and insist that he tell Harry the truth about his lycanthropy. And then she was going to bludgeon him into accepting help creating some sort of charm that would make it less of a curse. Somehow.</p>
<p>Sirius stood opposite Lacey, but his eyes were only for the altar in the center of the ritual room. His robes were covered with fish and seaweed, all drifting in a current that wound from the bottom of the robe up towards his shoulders and then down towards his fingertips. She'd have placed him as fire, but his mercurial personality worked just as well as water.</p>
<p>That'd left Lacey as fire and she absolutely wasn't going to admit that it was appropriate. Especially not when every single one of those men had nodded like it was a foregone conclusion as soon as the fire robe was revealed. Her temper wasn't that bad.</p>
<p>Except when it was.</p>
<p>"We are ready," Ragnok said as he carefully placed the last item, Ravenclaw's diadem, onto the altar. "Humans, your job is to stand firm and to remember your duty. Protect Harry Potter by not allowing Voldemort's soul shards to pass. We will pull them out. We will unify them. We will destroy them."</p>
<p>"Understood," Lacey said when the men only nodded.</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, understood," Remus said.</p>
<p>"Whew, um, yeah, ready," Anthony said though he glanced nervously towards Lacey and then Sirius as if he wasn't at all ready for this. "Kind of wish that Petunia could do this."</p>
<p>Ragnok laughed, a harsh bark of noise. "Had she the strength for ritual work, we would have invited her. She's waiting outside for our report so do not fail."</p>
<p>"Won't!" Sirius immediately declared, eyes wide. "Trust us, Voldie won't get past us."</p>
<p>Lacey pressed her lips together so that she wouldn't start cackling at the way Anthony and Remus both nodded urgent agreement. She was telling Petunia about this the first chance she got. Maybe while they were all listening in. Petunia's little sniff, the smirk she'd get and the way it would make the guys wince, would be well worth it.</p>
<p>"We begin," Ragnok declared.</p>
<p>He pulled a staff from his dimensional store, hitting the stone floor and sending up sparks that spiraled around the room. The other mage-goblins moved into position around the altar, forming a perfect hexagon. Their staves drew sparks, too. In moments a haze of flame separated Lacey from them and the altar.</p>
<p>She couldn't hear the words they chanted. Nor could she read their lips. Certainly deliberate on Ragnok's part. Why share a powerful ritual when you hadn't been paid to do so?</p>
<p>Her scampering thoughts screeched to a stop as the diadem began to vibrate on the altar. Smoke billowed up out of it. Lacey immediately cast her strongest shields around the flame-ward. Remus blanketed hers. Then Anthony put his and Sirius blew out a breath before casting wards the like of which she'd never seen around the lot.</p>
<p>Sirius' wards were silver, quicksilver, alive like hungry ferrets hunting prey. They shifted and moved. After a moment, Lacey realized that no, they were more like schools of fish, darting to and fro as they hunted for prey.</p>
<p>Her ward, the one closest to the goblin's flame-ward rumbled and burned with her fury. Remus' was deep, grounded in the earth and grew over the top like the arch of a forest's canopy. Anthony's flowed between them all, living air forcing everything evil back within the confines of the ward.</p>
<p>She could feel their magic. She could feel the goblin's pressing more magic into the ritual as the cup began to smoke, then the locket and the ring. The diary began to smoke last of all. It gave off a great blech of smoke that formed a screaming face that whooshed at and then through the flame-ward.</p>
<p>Lacey snarled and held firm. Anthony's magic backed her up as Sirius and Remus both pushed in to tear at the diary's soul shard as it battered at the shields. It's horcrux.</p>
<p>There was no craft, no ritual, to this. Lacey sweated under her lovely robe, sweated and snarled and refused to let that foul… thing… pass!</p>
<p>It wailed and whirled back into the center of the altar, whirling around and around the ring which glowed now like a black Lumos. Lacey kept the wards strong, gritting her teeth as the goblins' chanting grew louder, stronger, deeper.</p>
<p>The ring glowed brighter and brighter as it pulled each of the soul shards into it. Then, as Lacey swayed and licked sweat-salt off her lips, the Stone cracked, the ring's golden prongs falling to the altar. The instant it touched the altar stone, the magic of the ritual sucked at them all, pulling and pulling and pulling.</p>
<p>Sucking the last shard of Voldemort's soul free from wherever it had hidden.</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>"I'm so glad it's Friday!" Ron exclaimed as they made their way, for the first time without a prefect or upper year student to guide them, to DADA. "Two more classes and we get a break!"</p>
<p>"There's still a bunch of assignments to do, you know," Harry said with a grin at Ron's disheartened groan. "You'll do much better if you just sit down and work on them every day. It's much easier."</p>
<p>"I don't want to," Ron complained. "We've only been in school for a week. Why do we have to have so many assignments? Why can't we have more fun?"</p>
<p>He'd been complaining about their schoolwork ever since that night that Harry explained what was going on with the blocks. Ron definitely could understand the work now. He hadn't been able to before, though he'd only admitted that in a blushing mumble. When Ron sat down and read his assignments now, worked on them, he finished them as fast as either Harry or Hermione. Draco was slightly slower than Ron but that was because his penmanship was actually legible, unlike Ron's.</p>
<p>Neville laughed. "I'm with Harry. Just do the work, get it done, and then you can have fun. It's not that much. Harry does way more than any of us."</p>
<p>"There's so much to learn!" Harry exclaimed even though everyone laughed at him for it. "I'm serious. There's tons of interesting things and so many books to read."</p>
<p>"I don't know why you didn't end up in Ravenclaw, mate," Ron mock-grumbled. </p>
<p>He gently punched Harry in the shoulder, barely even rocking Harry, but then Harry was used to Dudley's punches. Nothing yet had compared to Dudley's magic fists of doom.</p>
<p>The classroom still stank to high heaven of garlic. Harry kind of wondered, along with most every student in the school, whether Professor Quirrell had filled his oversized turban with garlic in an effort to protect himself from imaginary vampires. Or his memories of the vampires he'd encountered in Romania, maybe.</p>
<p>It was almost enough to put Harry off garlic. Almost. Not quite, though.</p>
<p>Ron and Draco pushed each other, losing the spot next to Harry to Blaise who slipped into the seat as they battled each other. Neville already had Harry's right hand, just like he always did.</p>
<p>"Th-that's enough, ch-children," Professor Quirrell said with an attempt at a stern stare at Ron and Draco. "T-take your seats, p-p-p-p.. now."</p>
<p>That left Draco and Ron sitting with Pansy who made them sit next to each other. Harry couldn't blame her for that. He wouldn't have wanted to be between them. Even though both Draco and Ron agreed that the blood feud was stupid, they seemed to enjoy fighting with each other over utterly stupid things. It was mental so Harry stayed well out of it. They could fight their own ridiculous battles.</p>
<p>"O-open your b-b-b-books to Ch-chapter Three," Professor Quirrell said.</p>
<p>He turned to start writing on the board but staggered. Professor Quirrell gasped and clutched at his turban. Light poured out of his hands and then he whirled to glare at Harry with blood red eyes and smoke pouring from his nose and mouth.</p>
<p>The magic in the smoke was dark, horrifyingly dark. The Black magic bellowed inside of Harry, making him and Draco jerk. The Potter magic roared with a rage that sounded distinctly feminine. Like Aunt Petunia in a fury.</p>
<p>Or maybe like Harry's mum.</p>
<p>Voldemort.</p>
<p>Professor Quirrell was Voldemort. </p>
<p>Somehow. </p>
<p>Harry shuddered and then bolted to his feet. His chair toppled over behind him in a clatter that startled Blaise and Neville to their feet, too.</p>
<p>"Everyone get away from him!" Harry yelled as he pulled his wand from his holster. "Move, move, move!"</p>
<p>The other kids in the class screamed and ran for the rear of the room. Ron got there first, hauling on the door desperately.</p>
<p>"It won't open!" Ron shouted. "We're trapped!"</p>
<p>"Harry Potter!" Quirrell shouted in that silky strange voice he only used when talking alone to Harry.</p>
<p>The smoke billowed up and out of Quirrell who collapsed to the floor, eyes rolled back in his head and blood coming from his nose, mouth and ears. It was just like the soul shards. No, this was the final fragment of Voldemort. It had to be!</p>
<p>Harry pushed his magic through the wand, only then realizing that it was his grandfather's dueling wand.</p>
<p>"Stay back!" Harry shouted with every bit of his magic, all the Potter magic, all the Black magic. "Don't touch anyone!"</p>
<p>It wasn't enough. Harry could feel Voldemort's soul fragment battering against the shield he'd thrown up on pure instinct. Quirrell had only lectured about shields, not let them try to cast them yet. But his grandfather's wand knew exactly how to cast shields and it drew more power from Harry then he knew he had inside of his soul.</p>
<p>"Stay back!" Neville shouted as he stood next to Harry with the wand Harry had given him.</p>
<p>A moment later, Draco was by Harry's side. Then Susan and Ron and Blaise and then every single student in class threw up shields of their own to reinforce Harry's.</p>
<p>Voldemort wailed, throwing himself against the shields in increasing desperation. Wisps of his smoke, his magic, began peeling off and zipping up through the ceiling. Then more and more of him was pulled away until Voldemort screamed and was dragged out of the classroom entirely, leaving them all staring at their shields and shaking.</p>
<p>Harry was shaking anyway. He panted, and carefully, as best as he could remember, dismissed his shield. It took three tries but eventually the shield fell. The others dropped theirs. Eventually it was just Neville staring at the ceiling as if he expected Voldemort to come rushing back in.</p>
<p>"He's gone, mate," Ron said. He put his hand on Neville's shoulder. "Come on. Let it go. They caught him. He's trapped. He's not coming back. Let the shield go."</p>
<p>Neville stared at Ron for a long moment but finally let his shield go, too.</p>
<p>The room was silent. Still. Quiet. It stank of garlic but something much worse, too. Harry put his hand over his mouth, gagging, only the shout as the door slammed open and a flood of teachers poured in.</p>
<p>Shields slammed into the teachers as Ron, Draco, Susan and Pansy defended them all.</p>
<p>"Put those down this instant!" Professor McGonagall snapped at them. "What in the world is going on in here?"</p>
<p>"Voldemort," Harry said. Every teacher froze, even Dumbledore who lurked behind Professor McGonagall and Flitwick. "Professor Quirrell was Voldemort."</p>
<p>"Possessed," Blaise said. "He was possessed. Something pulled You-Know-Who right out of him. Harry shielded us. Then we all shielded too when Harry's shield started to fail."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>Every single teacher shouted that, but Dumbledore was the loudest. He shoved everyone else aside, rushing into kneel by Professor Quirrell's side. Harry could feel the magic Dumbledore did, but he didn't recognize it. All he knew, as he stood there swaying in rising exhaustion, was that it felt oily. Strange and wrong and as oily as a plastic school binder that'd been left in the sun so long that the oil started to leech out and stick to your fingers and desk and clothes, leaving stains that you could never get out.</p>
<p>"Tell me what happened, Harry," Dumbledore said. "Tell me what you did!"</p>
<p>He rose and the twinkle was gone. Completely gone. Only the hard, angry glare was left. Professor Flitwick was just there in front of Harry, his wand out and a glow lighting his small body. Then Professor McGonagall was at Harry's side, gripping his shoulder.</p>
<p>"Blaise said," Harry said. He swallowed and looked at his grandfather's wand. "I didn't mean to go for this one. It's too strong for me yet."</p>
<p>"That's not the wand you're supposed to have!" Dumbledore snapped at Harry. "What did you do? How did you drive him out?"</p>
<p>"I didn't," Harry said. "But I'd bet that the goblins finally found all the other pieces of his soul. They said that they could. That they would. They said that they'd be able to draw him from wherever he was once they had enough of his soul. It looks like they were right."</p>
<p>Dumbledore's eyes went wide. His mouth twisted into a snarl that sent all the kids other than Ron, Draco and Neville running out the door. Professor Hooch was on Harry's other side, wand out. Then Professor Snape stepped into his field of vision, a sneer twisting his face.</p>
<p>"I doubt the boy had anything to do with it," Professor Snape said. "This was probably yet another prank."</p>
<p>"I don't play pranks, Professor," Harry said, glaring at him. "But no. I didn't have anything to do with it."</p>
<p>"You must have!" Dumbledore shouted. His wand was just in his hand, glowing slightly as if he was about to throw a curse at Harry. "You must have defeated him!"</p>
<p>Professor Flitwick cast a quick, silent spell and Dumbledore's wand arced out of his hand into Flitwick's free hand.</p>
<p>"That's enough of that," Professor Flitwick snapped. "You'll calm down right now or I'll stun you."</p>
<p>"My wand," Dumbledore said so numbly that Harry frowned at him. "You took my wand."</p>
<p>"You'll get it back the instant I decide you're calm enough to have it," Professor Flitwick said as he hid Dumbledore's wand somewhere in his robes. Maybe in an expanded pocket. That would work.</p>
<p>Harry realized that he was giggling quietly when Professor McGonagall started pulling him towards the door. Oh my. His legs just did not want to work. Why wouldn't they work?</p>
<p>"You're magically exhausted, Mr. Potter," Professor McGonagall said much more kindly than Harry expected. "We'll just get you to the infirmary and you'll be fine."</p>
<p>"No, not there," Harry said. He stopped dead in his tracks, blinking up at Professor McGonagall and then at Dumbledore who snarled at Harry. "I won't go there. I don't trust the infirmary. I want Aunt Petunia. And Anthony Black. Remus, too."</p>
<p>"Don't be ridiculous," Professor McGonagall said with a strong twinkle in her eyes. "There's no need for histrionics, Mr. Potter."</p>
<p>"Kreacher!" Harry snapped. "Itzy, Bitsy, Zing, Lenny, Crow!"</p>
<p>They all popped in to form a ring around Harry that became a shield to push Professor McGonagall away from him. Harry sighed, plopping to the floor right there in the hallway. Kreacher shook his head and patted Harry's shoulder.</p>
<p>"Master Harry is as bad as Master Sirius," Kreacher said. "Master Harry must rest."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I know," Harry said, panting. He swallowed down a yawn. "But not where I'm not safe. You're to watch over me. All of you. As many of you as necessary to make sure no one puts more blocks on me. And the others, watch over the others. Don't let Dumbledore touch them."</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter!" Professor McGonagall gasped. </p>
<p>The twinkle in her eyes surged and faded, surged and faded. Even as tired as Harry was, he could see her trying to fight free of whatever Dumbledore had done to her. But it didn't seem like she could win free properly because the twinkle grew as Dumbledore muttered something in the DADA room.</p>
<p>"Hey, you okay?" Ron asked Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>He took her hand at the same time that the twins stepped out of the crowd. The Weasley family magic tore into the blocks on her. Then Draco took her hand, and Neville grabbed her arm. Susan ran over to put her hands against Professor McGonagall's side.</p>
<p>Their magic surged into Professor McGonagall. Her magic surged to meet it. Harry leaned into Kreacher's side as he felt and heard and tasted and smelled the blocks shatter into a million pieces. It sounded like hundreds of glass windows breaking all at once, felt like leaping into a shallow mud puddle that'd frozen in the middle of January, smelled like that first slice through an onion just before the smell made you cry.</p>
<p>Inside the DADA room, Dumbledore gasped and clutched his chest.</p>
<p>"Good," Harry whispered to Kreacher. "She's free. Make sure she stays free, Kreacher. Make sure she gets one of the charms."</p>
<p>"Master will sleep now," Kreacher said. "Kreacher will take care of you and Crow will pass out charms. Many, many charms."</p>
<p>Harry wanted to ask why it would be 'many, many' but his eyes drooped as Professor McGonagall started cursing up a storm that would've made even Uncle Vernon in a rugby rage cringe. He tried to stay awake so that he could remember the curses. He failed.</p>
<p>But wow, he hadn't had a clue that Professor McGonagall could curse like that…</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Smeltings was boring. Stupidly, ridiculously, unbelievably boring. As boring as listening to Dad's rugby lecture for the fourth time in a day. As boring as having to sit polite and pretty for one of Mum's tea parties with the neighbors. Heck, it was as boring as not being able to be full after eating everything he could and having no other thoughts than not liking Harry, so he had to beat him up.</p>
<p>Over and over and over and over.</p>
<p>Stupid curse. His whole childhood had been boring, and he'd had no clue that it could be any different because of that stupid Dumbledore. Dudley sighed as he followed his new 'friends' from the cafeteria out to the grounds.</p>
<p>All they talked about was rugby, grades and whose parents were more important than whose. Like that took long to figure out. Dudley'd taken all of ten minutes to sort them out, going back to their grandparents and all the titles and money they were looking to inherit.</p>
<p>Granted, none of them had an Aunt Marge to drill that stuff into their heads.</p>
<p>Or Harry to study with, for that matter.</p>
<p>"You're sighing a lot," Piers commented. He'd been really twitchy around Dudley ever since the curses were broken. Still was, even at Smeltings.</p>
<p>"I'm bored," Dudley said. He rolled his eyes as all the others turned to stare at him. "I am. Same complaints. Same brags. Same stupid posturing. Like I couldn't tell in ten minutes that Tommy-boy's bottom of the heap when it comes to rank but top when it comes to money. And Piers, you're middle of the lot, no matter how you look. All the jabber and it's a waste of time."</p>
<p>Tommy glared at Dudley. "Like you've got anything to brag about, Dursley."</p>
<p>"Eh, my cousin's gonna be a duke," Dudley said with a casual shrug. "Not that Harry's much for going on about it. He'd rather have his parents back, you know. Murdered when he was just a baby. We were both babies when it happened."</p>
<p>"Murdered?" Piers asked, blinking at Dudley with confusion. "I thought his parents were drunks?"</p>
<p>"Nah, that's just a story Dad told because he was being an idiot," Dudley said. "Mum set him to rights before we came. Middle of the summer, that whole time Aunt Marge was visiting?"</p>
<p>Piers shuddered. He'd stayed well away during Aunt Marge's visit. Dudley hadn't missed him. Not at all. Honestly, he kind of loathed Piers and his new group of friends. They were so stupid. Honestly stupid, dim-witted and slow instead of just annoying. Though they were annoying, too.</p>
<p>"No, his parents were murdered outright," Dudley said, staring north towards Harry's school, the one he'd never get to see. "Tragedy, that was. Makes you wonder. What he coulda been, what I coulda been. Wouldn't be going here, that's for sure."</p>
<p>Got a full round of glares from them for that. Dudley rolled his eyes and waved a hand at them. Like he cared what they thought. None of them had magic fists. None of them had magic anything. He didn't fit here, and he knew it. They knew it too, just like Mum had always said.</p>
<p>People could tell when you were different. None of them liked it.</p>
<p>At all.</p>
<p>"Either way, you're all boring," Dudley said. "I'm going to the library. Gotta be something decent to read."</p>
<p>"You hate reading," Piers objected. He was pale and shaking, eyes so wide you'd think he'd seen a ghost.</p>
<p>"Mmm, used to," Dudley agreed. "Don't anymore."</p>
<p>His skin itched. His hands felt too heavy to gesture at Piers, at Tommy-boy. At any of them. There was a crackle between his fingers, a shimmer of light and sound that was just on the edge of there. Dudley turned and walked away, striding away from them even though Piers, hesitantly, called after him.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Tommy-boy snidely told Piers to let Dudley go. Apparently, they didn't need 'someone like that' hanging around. Huh. Mum really had been right.</p>
<p>The instant Dudley went around a corner, out of sight, he bolted. The dean's office was three floors up, at the far end of the school. Dudley ran the whole way, pelting through the empty hallways with is heart pounding and his hands crackling with magic.</p>
<p>Harry.</p>
<p>Something was wrong with Harry. He needed to get to Harry. He needed to protect Harry.</p>
<p>Right now!</p>
<p>"Sir!" Dudley blurted as he slammed the dean's office open. "I gotta go home. Now!"</p>
<p>The dean wasn't at his desk. He was sitting in the big leather armchair he kept by the window. A tray of much better than cafeteria food sat on the little table next to him. When he looked at Dudley, he scowled.</p>
<p>But only until he saw the crackling magic around Dudley's fists.</p>
<p>"Boy, you stop that," the dean said just like Dad used to around Harry.</p>
<p>"No," Dudley said. He clenched his fists and the magic jumped like lightning over his knuckles. "I need to go home. Immediately. You know what this is," Dudley waved his fist at the dean who paled, "so you know how important it is when I say that my Patriarch is in danger. I need to go. Now!"</p>
<p>The dean paled further, sucking in a breath that he let out in a shuddery rush. It took a moment but eventually he nodded.</p>
<p>"Call," the dean said. "I'll have someone pack your things."</p>
<p>"Don't bother," Dudley snapped. "Zing! Come here, quick. I need to get to Harry. And Mum."</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>Harry woke to someone's fingers gently combing through his hair. Sort of gently. His hair was tangled, like always, so there were little tugs as whoever it was pulled on a knot and then gently untangled it.</p>
<p>It was nice. Strange, nothing he'd ever had before, but nice.</p>
<p>"Aunt Petunia?" Harry asked once he managed to open his eyes.</p>
<p>"You do get in the most ridiculous situations, Harry," Aunt Petunia said with a wry, sad little smile.</p>
<p>She was sitting on the side of his bed at school, the curtains drawn about them both. It was so very strange seeing her here, at Hogwarts. He wouldn't have ever expected that Aunt Petunia would be allowed to come see him.</p>
<p>"What happened?" Harry asked.</p>
<p>"The elves flatly refused to allow anyone near you but me," Aunt Petunia said with a little sniff. </p>
<p>Not the sniff of doom. The 'really, why are you this way?' sniff that was at least partially fondness and amusement to go with the annoyance. She smiled as Harry rolled over and tried to sit up. He failed.</p>
<p>"I'm so tired again," Harry complained. "Why do I keep getting so tired when I do things?"</p>
<p>"Healer Smethwyck says that it's because you keep using up your magical stores," Aunt Petunia said. She shook her head. "I'd say it's because you absorbed all of Vernon's ideas about charging straight into a situation without thinking first. What were you thinking using a wand that was too strong for you?"</p>
<p>"Didn't mean to pull that one," Harry mumbled through a jaw-cracking yawn. "It just jumped into my hand."</p>
<p>Aunt Petunia's sigh said that she thought that was a very poor excuse. Which, you know, it probably was, but it was true. Harry'd wanted his regular wand, not the one that made it feel like he was about to turn himself inside out from the amount of power it pulled.</p>
<p>"How long have I been out?" Harry asked.</p>
<p>"About six hours," Aunt Petunia said. "The school is being investigated. Your friend Susan contacted her aunt who's brought in every investigative resource there is. Including ones from the continent. It's quite the show. Dudley's having the time of his life."</p>
<p>"Oh, no," Harry groaned. "He's here?"</p>
<p>"Oh, yes," Aunt Petunia said with a stern look at Harry that made him squirm. "We all felt what you did. Anthony was beside himself. Dudley put himself in such a state that he was sent home for a week off because of 'the stress' getting to him. Vernon was unaffected, of course, but all of Anthony and Lacey's sisters showed up demanding to see you."</p>
<p>Harry groaned even louder. "Sirius?"</p>
<p>"He's still at Black Castle," Aunt Petunia reassured Harry. "Remus came instead. He very nearly tore Dumbledore apart. Apparently, there was a Cerberus in the school guarding some sort of half-completed maze. No one knows why. Yet."</p>
<p>Harry shook his head. Everything Dumbledore did made no sense. Well. No, not really. It made sense in that it all gave him more power and authority. A lot more power than he should have and way more authority than should rest in one man's hands.</p>
<p>So many wars had been fought against one man controlling everything and here Harry was in a castle that belonged, illegally, maybe, to a man trying to control all of Magical Britain. Aunt Marge would be ranting her head off. Harry kind of wanted to rant, too, but he was far too tired for it.</p>
<p>"You should sleep," Aunt Petunia said. "I'll deal with that man."</p>
<p>"No, no, you should deal with Professor Snape," Harry said. He grinned at the sharp look Aunt Petunia gave him. "He went all kinds of pale when I told him that you remembered him. And then wouldn't look me in the eye when I said I'd ask you about him."</p>
<p>Harry leaned back into his pillows as Aunt Petunia smiled. That was the smile she used when someone tried to cut down Uncle Vernon at a party. Aunt Petunia patted Harry's arm and tugged the covers up over him again.</p>
<p>"Get some sleep," Aunt Petunia ordered. "Kreacher and the elves are keeping watch over you. You're safe."</p>
<p>"Thank you," Harry said.</p>
<p>He waited until the curtain was shut to laugh as he wiggled down under the covers further. Tomorrow, when he felt better, he was going to have to ask Dudley and Draco and Blaise and maybe Ron about the confrontation between Aunt Petunia and Professor Snape. Maybe Hermione, too.</p>
<p>She had to be so worried about him. Hermione always fussed. Over everything. At least she wasn't here in Gryffindor. If she was, she'd probably be right there in his room scolding him for doing something reckless and dangerous.</p>
<p>"Not like I had a choice," Harry complained. He yawned. "Oh, darn. I forgot to ask Aunt Petunia about the Gryffindor magic thing."</p>
<p>Harry woke the next time to Kreacher standing on the bed next to him as he glared at someone on the other side of Harry's bed curtains.</p>
<p>"Master Harry had best get up," Kreacher declared with an angry little sniff. "No one is having any sense at all. Master Harry had best claim the Gryffindor magics fast, too, because Bad Dumbledore is causing more trouble than we is able to handle."</p>
<p>"What'd he do?" Harry squeaked as he sat straight up.</p>
<p>Nothing felt off about his bed but the curtains were a very effective barrier against all sound and magic from outside. He'd noticed that the third day in school. The light was gold and pink, tinting the bottoms of the bed curtains so it must be dawn. He'd slept the day and night away.</p>
<p>Who knew what'd happened?</p>
<p>"Kreacher," Harry said, tugging at Kreacher's sleeve. "What happened? Seriously, I need to know. I still don't know how to claim the Gryffindor magic when I can't find it. None of the books I have are any help."</p>
<p>Kreacher huffed as if Harry was being silly. "Is not a finding, Master Harry. Is a claiming. You is not to find it. You is to claim it and if you is worthy, which you and your whole line are, then it is finding you."</p>
<p>"Oh," Harry said. He blinked several times, wishing abruptly for his discarded glasses because it would be nice to have something to fidget with. "Well, that's easier than what I thought. But it doesn't answer what's happened. Is everyone all right? Aunt Petunia and Dudley are okay, aren't they? And Remus. What about Anthony and Lacey and their sisters?"</p>
<p>"They is all here, fighting with Bad Dumbledore all night long," Kreacher said. "No one is getting anything done. Is very annoying. That nurse is coming again and again but Kreacher is not letting her near you. Master Harry does not need healing. He needed sleep. You has sleep. Now is time for doing things."</p>
<p>"Right," Harry said. He blew out a breath and then threw the covers off. "You're right. I'll get dressed and head down to help everyone. Um. Is the claiming thing dramatic?"</p>
<p>Kreacher made a face, his ears going catawampus as he grimaced and shrugged. "Was very dramatic for Fawley heir who claimed Ravenclaw magic. Was very, very dramatic but happened in France so no one here knows has happened. Was not dramatic for Madame Bones. She did not let Hufflepuff magic be. No one can claim Slytherin magics unless Master Harry allows it. Master Harry's parents subdued and won it before Master Harry was taken away and cursed."</p>
<p>Harry stared at him. Someday, hopefully very soon, he was going to find a book that actually gave him real, useful, accurate information on what the house elves could see and do. One that didn't act like they were degenerate and polluted. One that explained how wixen and house elves had come to work together.</p>
<p>It had to exist. Somewhere. And if it didn't, then he'd write the darn thing himself.</p>
<p>Because wow. All the answers he'd been looking for all week, right there.</p>
<p>"I should've asked you for more information last time I talked to you," Harry said. "Oh well, I know now. Do you think the Slytherin magic would like Lucius? Or maybe Remus."</p>
<p>"Not Master Wolf," Remus said. "His magics is not accepting that sort of thing. Master Lucius would be good but he is too fragile yet."</p>
<p>"Huh, maybe Blaise," Harry muttered. He peeked out of his bed curtains and was desperately relieved that no one was there. "Or Pansy. She'd be really good at it."</p>
<p>"Little Parkinson would be good," Kreacher agreed. He hopped off the bed and went through Harry's trunk to pull out his nicest socks and pants, his best charcoal trousers and the burgundy shirt with long sleeves that Harry loved best of all. Then he put the casual robe in deep royal red on top of it. "Father would not be happy but she would work. Be careful about Master Blaise. Mother is very scary, Master Harry. Very, very scary."</p>
<p>Harry grinned as he took his bath things, leaving the clothes to Kreacher when he glared up at Harry for daring to reach out to take them, and then headed to the bathroom with Kreacher by his side.</p>
<p>"You say that about Aunt Petunia," Harry said.</p>
<p>"Mistress Pet is very scary!" Kreacher exclaimed, ears flapping with his vehemence. "Master Harry is just not seeing right."</p>
<p>No one was on the stairs. Or in the bathroom. The entire time Harry spent getting cleaned up, moving faster and faster because the sheer lack of no one wandering in had him twitchy, not a single peep came from the hallways. There was no one in the common room. Or on the stairs heading down to the great hall.</p>
<p>When Harry pushed the door to the great hall open a crack, he saw why.</p>
<p>Absolutely everyone was there.</p>
<p>Watching as Dumbledore argued with Aunt Petunia, Madame Bones, Madame Longbottom, Lacey and Professor McGonagall. Whose magic was swirling and sparkling around her like a firestorm.</p>
<p>There was obviously some kind of privacy spell wrapped around them because all Harry could hear was the occasional shuffling foot or awkward cough. No one even noticed him lurking at the doorway, peeking through the gap.</p>
<p>Harry shut the door and turned to Kreacher who was glaring at the door like he wanted to be in there yelling at Dumbledore, too.</p>
<p>"Okay, what's going on?" Harry demanded. "No dodging, Kreacher. I need to understand this."</p>
<p>Kreacher pulled on his ears and stomped a foot. "Master Harry must claim Gryffindor Magic!"</p>
<p>"That's a solution, not an explanation," Harry said. "I need more words."</p>
<p>Kreacher blinked at him before muttering and shaking his head in despair. Harry rolled his eyes. Fine.</p>
<p>"Crow," Harry said and then laughed as Crow popped to his side and latched herself around his thigh. "Hey, what did we say about that?"</p>
<p>"Master Harry said that Crow should not hug in public," Crow said with a huge grin that wrinkled her eyes and nose up adorably. It was like looking at an especially happy pug. "We is not in public, Master Harry."</p>
<p>Harry laughed and shook his head. "Okay, that's fair. You heard?"</p>
<p>"Crow heard," Crow said. "She doesn't know why Master Harry needs more words. Answer is still answer."</p>
<p>"Because I like knowing All the Things," Harry said with especially pompous emphasis on the last few words. As predicted, that finally got Kreacher to sigh and nod while Crow made little high-pitched humming noises of understanding. "So, what's going on here?"</p>
<p>"Bad Dumbles is trying to say that Master Harry did not protect himself and others against Voldeghost," Crow said. She laughed and dodged Kreacher's half-hearted swat at her for the mangled name. "Everyone else is saying that he is wrong and that Voldeghost," she dodged again, "is dead. Which he is. Is just distraction, Master Harry. Bad Dumbles is trying to make everyone look away from Mistress Kitty's broken blocks. And all the broken blocks on all the kids and grown-ups at Hogwarts. When Weasley magic broke blocks on Mistress Kitty's magic, it broke all the blocks on all the people here because Weasley magic is old and strong and very, very angry. Was Very Big Deal that Bad Dumbles not wants anyone to notice until he can fixes it."</p>
<p>She pointed dramatically at Kreacher as if he was Harry, dancing in place while Kreacher groaned, buried his face in his hands and shook his head in dismay.</p>
<p>"Look! Look! Is very bad Voldeghost hiding in small boy!" Crow exclaimed. "Do not be lookings at anything else. Try and find bad Voldeghost hiding inside. Listenings to me because I is great and powerful and pretended to do good things a long, long, long time ago!"</p>
<p>Harry grinned at her.</p>
<p>"Crow is ridiculous!" Kreacher huffed. "Go back to work, you. Kreacher will take care of Master Harry. Crow is to make Master Sirius laugh and stay right where he is."</p>
<p>Crow giggled. "I can be doing that, but Master Harry must go claim Gryffindor magic. Quick-like."</p>
<p>"Publicly and dramatically?" Harry asked. "Or quietly and secretly?"</p>
<p>Kreacher and Crow exchanged looks. While Kreacher grimaced and frowned, Crow danced in place, tugging on her ears. Finally, they both turned back to Harry.</p>
<p>"Publicly will be better, Master Harry," Kreacher said. "Will be fewer people who can listen to Bad Dumbledore lies."</p>
<p>Crow nodded. "Let Gryffindor magic be as big and flashy as it wants to be, Master Harry. But not earthquakes. Hogwarts elves is not liking earthquakes."</p>
<p>"…Okay," Harry said, stomach turning flips at the idea of claiming something that could cause earthquakes. "Go on, Crow. Tell Sirius that I'll be fine. And then maybe sit on him so that he doesn't come here."</p>
<p>"Crow is gluing him to his bed," Crow declared with a wicked grin that Kreacher grumbled and shook his head over.</p>
<p>She disappeared, leaving Harry with Kreacher who complained under his breath about 'permissive masters' and 'encouraging her' and 'silly child'. Not aimed at Harry, as far as Harry could tell. Crow was much younger than the other Black elves and Kreacher was the only one who didn't indulge her.</p>
<p>"Go," Kreacher told Harry. "Kreacher will protect. Will be invisible but will be there making sure Master Harry is safe."</p>
<p>Harry smiled at him and put a hand on Kreacher's shoulder. "Thank you, Kreacher. I'm so glad that I can rely on you. It means a lot to me."</p>
<p>Kreacher flushed and muttered, just happy little noises with no meaning behind them, before pushing Harry towards the door. He disappeared but Harry could still feel his magic. Invisible. Wow, he really needed to find that book on Elves. They could do just about anything.</p>
<p>Harry took a deep breath. Claim the Gryffindor magic. Stop Dumbledore. He could do that. He would do that.</p>
<p>Probably.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>How had he not noticed before?</p>
<p>Filius hummed quietly as he held the Elder Wand firmly up his sleeve. It shouldn't have been possible for Dumbledore to hide an artifact like this from him. Goblin sight wasn't an easy thing to obscure.</p>
<p>Dumbledore had clearly done it, somehow. For years, even. Outside of the curses and the compulsions and the potions from who knew where, that one thing was a troublesome detail that Filius desperately wanted to discuss with Ragnok. More importantly, he wanted to slip away and take the Elder Wand to the bank so that it could be properly secured.</p>
<p>It vibrated angrily in his sleeve at that thought.</p>
<p>As if he was a proper carrier for the Elder Wand. Filius didn't allow himself to snort. That would be incredibly rude to Death and his wand.</p>
<p>How had Dumbledore gotten it? Where? When? It had to have been back during the war against Grindelwald. Filius' stomach churned at the idea of Grindelwald ever touching this wand.</p>
<p>Oh, goodness, his thoughts were running in circles like he was as young as his first year Ravenclaws.</p>
<p>He set to work on controlling his breathing, not that Filius expected it would help a bit. At least it turned his thoughts outwards instead of inwards.</p>
<p>Just in time for the doors to the Great Hall to open.</p>
<p>Filius didn't look Harry's way. He kept his eyes on Minerva, Petunia and Amelia as they argued vehemently against Dumbledore's demands that Harry be arrested, interrogated with Veratiserum and thrown into Azkaban. As if Harry could possibly be possessed by Voldemort. The boy's aura was perfectly clear.</p>
<p>And very determined.</p>
<p>Magic swirled invisibly around him, red and gold and so very old. So powerful. Filius didn't know if Harry could see it. He'd shown no signs of being aware of the Gryffindor magic since he came to the castle, but there'd been less before. Now it hung around Harry like a cloud, like a mantle.</p>
<p>Like the cloak of a king striding towards his throne.</p>
<p>Or a king striding into battle against his sworn enemy.</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>No one noticed when Harry opened the doors to the Great Hall.</p>
<p>Overhead, the floating candles guttered, almost going out only to blaze back to life. He'd never seen that before. Maybe Crow and Kreacher were right? The Gryffindor magic was following him and would find him when he claimed it? Hopefully so.</p>
<p>Either way, it felt very, very strange to stride into the Great Hall with no one paying the least attention to him.</p>
<p>The seventh-year students started noticing when Harry slowly strode into the Hall, eyes locked on the grown-ups arguing with Dumbledore. Then the lower level students saw him. Finally, the first years who all looked hugely relieved that Harry was there.</p>
<p>Snape was the first teacher to notice his arrive. He sneered at Harry only to flinch when Hagrid glowered at him. Then Flitwick grinned and waved Dumbledore's wand at Harry. It wasn't until Harry was at the end of the tables where the gap between the students' tables and the teacher's tables up on the dais that Aunt Petunia and Dumbledore noticed him at the same time.</p>
<p>"You see?" Dumbledore exclaimed as the silence spell broke. "I'm right!"</p>
<p>"I am Harry James Potter," Harry declared. He paused, listening to his magic before nodding slightly. "I am the son of both Potter and Black magic. I am heir to the line of Gryffindor."</p>
<p>"No!" Dumbledore shouted.</p>
<p>He made as if to pull his wand but his hand came up empty because, of course, Flitwick still had his wand.</p>
<p>"This school and all these people are in danger," Harry declared. "I will protect them. I will protect this country. I will protect this world. I claim the Gryffindor magic as is my right."</p>
<p>Harry stood his ground as Dumbledore started at him. Dumbledore only got a step closer before Madame Bones and Madame Longbottom hit him with spells that froze him in place. Lacey's eyes were wide as saucers, as were the teachers other than Snape.</p>
<p>Aunt Petunia nodded to Harry, the little nod of approval that you would miss if you didn't know what to pay attention to.</p>
<p>A rushing sound, like a waterfall in the distance, echoed in the Great Hall. It got closer and closer, increasing the air pressure until Harry's ears popped. Then popped again and again. His chest felt too tight, like the air was too thick and too warm, like there was a gale and the wind was snatching the air out of his mouth before he could breathe in.</p>
<p>It was red.</p>
<p>Red with an edge of gold as it swirled around Harry, not quite touching him. He could feel it assessing him, measuring him against some impossible standard. But it wasn't impossible. Harry could feel the standard.</p>
<p>Is he good? Is he kind? Does he care? Will he think and work and try to do the best?</p>
<p>Yes, Harry thought at the Gryffindor magic. Yes, I will. I'll do my best. I don't know much yet but I've been trying all this time to do my best. Even when Dumbledore had my magic and my mind blocked, I tried to do my best.</p>
<p>"I just want everyone to be safe and happy," Harry said out loud. "That's all."</p>
<p>Bells rang overhead, as loud as if they were right there in the Great Hall with them but Harry didn't think that Hogwarts had any bells at all.</p>
<p>As he tried to figure that out, the Gryffindor magic twisted and slammed into Harry's chest. It was like taking one of Dudley's punches. Like being tackled in rugby or taking a bludger to the chest. Only more. So much more.</p>
<p>Harry could feel the Gryffindor magic swelling inside of him, filling all the places that had been left empty by his shielding yesterday. Then it went further and further, mixing with the Potter magic and the Black magic. It poured into Harry until it was coming out of his eyes and his ears and his mouth. </p>
<p>It flowed out his fingertips and toes, from the top of his head where his hair stood on end. Harry sucked in a breath, then another. Another.</p>
<p>"I… am… the heir… of Gryffindor," Harry managed to say. His voiced echoed with magic so that it boomed through the Great Hall, drowning out the bells that kept on pealing overhead somewhere. "This is my castle."</p>
<p>Dumbledore shuddered and abruptly broke through the spells that Madame Longbottom and Madame Bones had put on him. "No! You can't do this!"</p>
<p>"I declare Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore to be an enemy of the House of Potter," Harry declared. Saying it gave the overwhelming flood of magic something to do. It helped. It felt way better. "He is an enemy to the House of Black and forever the enemy of the line of Gryffindor. No one in the houses of Potter, Black or Gryffindor shall give him quarter, aid, or shelter. So mote it be!"</p>
<p>He was kind of surprised that he remembered the 'so mote it be' bit. The books on the Dwarves always emphasized how important such things were but Harry'd thought that it was a bit silly.</p>
<p>Not anymore. The 'so mote it be' ended the swirl of the Gryffindor magic around Harry. It flashed out to hit Dumbledore in the chest. Dumbledore screamed and staggered backwards, clutching his forehead.</p>
<p>"As Dumbledore is an enemy of the house of Potter, Black and Gryffindor," Madame Bones said in the same earthshakingly loud and powerful voice as Harry had just used, "so is he enemy to the house of Bones and Hufflepuff. We shall give him no aid or shelter. We will give him no quarter. So mote it be!"</p>
<p>Madame Bones looked downright delighted to say the 'so mote it be'. Her magic stabbed into Dumbledore like a bolt of lightning, knocking him onto his bum.</p>
<p>"You… don't know what you've done," Dumbledore said, panting as he struggled to stand back up. </p>
<p>When he dropped his hand, there was a mark on his forehead. It was like a mirror image to Harry's scar. Lacey gasped and apparated to stand in front of Harry with her wand out and glowing.</p>
<p>"Oh, I think we all know exactly what they've done," Aunt Petunia said in her strongest, most vibrating angry voice. She sniffed in the sudden silence. "They've revealed you for what you are. What I've always known you to be, you terrible old man. You stole my sister from me. You'll never take Harry now."</p>
<p>Dumbledore turned to glare at Aunt Petunia who wasn't standing behind Madame Bones and Madame Longbottom. She was standing to their side, the three of them in a row facing Dumbledore. He snarled and suddenly there was a wand in his hand.</p>
<p>It was rough, barely a wand at all. There was a thorn in the shaft of it, reddish against the aged grey of the wood. Harry flung himself forward as soon as he saw it. Something inside of him knew that wand. Knew that it was bad and dark and evil in ways that no one should face down, especially not Aunt Petunia who couldn't use the magic inside of her to shield, who couldn't protect herself except with words.</p>
<p>"Don't you hurt my mum!" Dudley bellowed from the other side of the room.</p>
<p>He slammed his fist into his hand and a blast of magic, wild and chaotic like a twenty-foot wave in a storm hitting a lighthouse, slammed into Dumbledore who shouted and staggered.</p>
<p>Harry made it between Aunt Petunia and Dumbledore, his feet skidding on the smooth floors. He staggered and then reached for his wand. It came out. And out and out and out until he realized that somehow, he'd pulled a sword out of his wand holster.</p>
<p>The sword was bigger than Harry, so heavy that the tip immediately hit the floor in a shower of sparks. Harry pushed it upright like a shield with his hands on the cross-guard. The Gryffindor magic surged into the sword and suddenly there was a shield between Harry and Dumbledore.</p>
<p>Instead of the green and silver that Harry was used to, this shield was red and gold. Gryffindor magic, almost entirely.</p>
<p>He reached for the Potter magic and a thread of it wove into the shield. Then the Black magic followed and the shield was suddenly a shifting pattern of red, gold, green and silver plaid that Harry wasn't entirely sure was visible with his eyes. It might just be the magic itself instead of true colors.</p>
<p>"Fawkes!" Dumbledore shouted as he flung up an arm.</p>
<p>"Bad Dumbles is not escaping!" Kreacher shouted at the same time.</p>
<p>Kreacher put a shield around Dumbledore but it did no good because Fawkes flamed into being inside of Kreacher's shield. He looked terribly sad as he landed on Dumbledore's arm but Fawkes still flamed away with Dumbledore.</p>
<p>The Gryffindor magic roared inside of Harry, not outside which was a relief. There was fury and pain and loss that Fawkes would take Dumbledore's side. Harry was going to have to ask Hermione to research that. Later. Maybe. He had too much other stuff to do it himself.</p>
<p>Or maybe he could ask Professor McGonagall?</p>
<p>The anger in the Gryffindor magic stilled enough for Harry's ears and mind and heart to focus on something besides the magic. He licked his lips as the Gryffindor magic stilled into a warm red wash inside of him. It was mixed in odd ways, like a lava lamp with three colors where Harry was the lamp.</p>
<p>Harry shook his head and huffed as his arms shook from the weight of the sword. Even with the magic's help it was heavy as all heck.</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>Even the bells had stopped ringing.</p>
<p>"You can drop the shield, Harry," Aunt Petunia said. She sniffed as he put one hand on Harry's shoulder. "It's over."</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am," Harry said.</p>
<p>It took a bit of concentration to get the Gryffindor, Potter and Black magic to settle down but they did. The instant the magic subsided and his shield collapsed, the sword suddenly weighed at least five times as much as it had. Harry squawked, trying to keep from letting the thing topple over. Dudley ran over and caught it.</p>
<p>"Oof, that weighs a ton," Dudley said with a huge grin. "You're never gonna grow into this thing, Harry."</p>
<p>"I know," Harry complained. "I need to know what's wrong with my wand holster. That's the second time in two days that I've gone for one wand and ended up with something else entirely."</p>
<p>The dead silence broke into a wave of giggles that swelled into laughter from all around. Harry rolled his eyes while Dudley grinned. Madame Bones looked a bit shaky. Next to her, Madame Longbottom looked outright furious despite her honk of a laugh. </p>
<p>The only person not laughing at all was Professor Snape to sat at the high table staring at Harry while shaking in his seat. For the very first time, Professor Snape didn't sneer at Harry. He didn't frown or curl a lip or even lift his chin so that Harry had to stare up his beak-like nose.</p>
<p>Professor Snape stared at Harry as if the sword in Harry's hands was going to chop his head off. Like Harry was going to kill him at any moment. And it was definitely Harry, not Aunt Petunia. Professor Snape's eyes never moved from Harry's face even as Aunt Petunia reached out to help Harry with the sword.</p>
<p>There was something very, very wrong there. Very wrong. Harry didn't know what it was, and he wasn't at all sure what to do about it, but first thing was figuring out what to do with his stupid new sword. Then tracking down Dumbledore. Then he could think about Snape.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Vernon let out a slow breath as he hung up his phone. Lacey'd managed to get her cell phone to work well enough to let him know that Pet, Dudley and Harry were all okay. Hale and healthy and, predictably, kicking people's arses from one end of Scotland to the other.</p>
<p>"I'm done," Vernon muttered. "Just done."</p>
<p>He turned off his computer. Sorted all the files in his in basket and then passed them off to the people who could do something with them. Most of them should have done it instead of passing it up to Vernon anyway. Vice Presidents didn't do such work, normally.</p>
<p>He took his pictures of his family and tucked them into his jacket pocket, the one that Lacey had spelled to be bigger on the inside than on the outside.</p>
<p>Then he stopped by Anthony's office in Accounting.</p>
<p>"What's up?" Anthony asked. He was shutting his computer down, too, though his desk was already clean and tidy. It always was.</p>
<p>"I'm done with this," Vernon announced.</p>
<p>"Ah, today's work?" Anthony asked cheerfully even though there was a wary shimmer in his eyes.</p>
<p>"No, with all of this," Vernon answered. </p>
<p>He looked around Anthony's plain, ordinary, boring office. It wasn't any different from Vernon's except that Anthony had pictures of Lacey while Vernon had pictures of Petunia and Dudley. Plus a new picture with all of them plus Harry and Remus and Sirius and Lacey and Anthony. Those pictures were the only things that mattered to Vernon in the whole company.</p>
<p>Both of Anthony's eyebrows went up. "Ah. You're not.. feeling anything?"</p>
<p>"Just… done," Vernon said. He laughed softly. "I've spent my whole life living up to other people's expectations, Anthony. Got this job because it made my dad proud. Kept it because my mum was so pleased every time I got promoted. It's…"</p>
<p>"Boring and safe," Anthony finished when Vernon couldn't put it into words. "You're not a safe man, Vernon. You never have been. I couldn't figure out what you saw in this job in the first place."</p>
<p>Vernon laughed as he shook his head. "I'll tell you later. I'm going to talk to the President."</p>
<p>"We'll both go," Anthony said as he used a quick flash of magic to gather up his pictures and a few trinkets from his desk drawer. He shrugged on his jacket while grinning at Vernon. "I was only here because you were. It'd be nice to be free to do more important things, you know."</p>
<p>"Yeah," Vernon said. He laughed with more feeling this time. "Yeah, it would. And it'd be nice to get back in shape for rugby. It's been so long since I've even attempted to play."</p>
<p>The weight on Vernon's heart lifted. Anthony clapped his shoulder and then gestured for Vernon to go first. Every step they took towards the President's office put more and more bounce in Vernon's steps. There was no reason to go on with this. None at all.</p>
<p>Just like Harry, he could be free finally.</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>"He has to be You-Know-Who in disguise!" Auror Dawlish shouted at Madame Bones.</p>
<p>Harry sighed as he leaned against Aunt Petunia's side. They'd all ended up in Dumbledore's office. Not so much because Harry wanted to go up there. He didn't. The last thing he wanted was to be in the middle of Dumbledore's nest of spells and traps and blocks.</p>
<p>But Madame Bones had insisted on it and Aunt Petunia had agreed, so they'd all trooped up there only to find that the gargoyle wouldn't move.</p>
<p>Harry had frowned at it and then tapped the nose of the gargoyle with the Gryffindor magic. It hadn't moved. Professor McGonagall had gone through the last six passwords, all of them various sorts of sweets, and none of those had worked. Finally, Harry had pulled on the Gryffindor magic and smashed the gargoyle to bits.</p>
<p>The stairwell was perfectly normal once he did. No moving stairs, nothing strange or unusual about it. They'd all gone up and Kreacher had brought breakfast for Harry and Dudley just in time for Madame Bones' staff to show up and start yelling about Harry being Voldemort.</p>
<p>"If you say that one more time," Madame Bones snarled with her wand against Auror Dawlish's chest, "I'm putting you through a wall and then throwing you in Azkaban!"</p>
<p>"But—!" Dawlish started to say only to pale as Madame Bones' wand went bright with magic. "Yes, ma'am."</p>
<p>He glared at Harry.</p>
<p>"I want to know how he decided on that," Harry said. He sipped the last of his tea-flavored milk. "I mean, it's only been, what? Half an hour since Dumbledore ran away? You kept Dumbledore here the whole time I was asleep. No one was able to leave the Great Hall or the castle. There was no one who could carry the message out of Hogwarts. The Hogwarts elves didn't do it. So how is Auror Dawlish saying the exact same things that Dumbledore was?"</p>
<p>Six stunners hit Dawlish from six different directions. Harry blinked, eyebrows going up. He hadn't expected that.</p>
<p>Madame Bones knelt next to Dawlish's side, muttering some sort of spell. "No Polyjuice. He's not Dumbledore in disguise."</p>
<p>"How many blocks's he got on him?" Dudley asked. He was upside down yet again, feet kicking in the air and hair brushing against the gaudy red and gold and purple carpet in Dumbledore's office. "F'all we know, he's like a puppet. Dumbledore did that to a lot of people, after all."</p>
<p>"Good point," Madame Bones said. "Take him to Saint Mungo's. No, no, wait. Take him to the ICW. I can't trust Saint Mungo's yet. Do not let him escape and do not come back here. You are to stay with him the entire time until I come to get you, is that clear? Do not release him to anyone but the ICW, either."</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am," the young woman with changing hair said. "I got it. Sorry, Harry. I was hoping to formally meet you. It'll have to wait."</p>
<p>"Who are you?"</p>
<p>"Tonks!" she said with a huge grin. "Cousin of yours. My mom got disowned but we're still cousins."</p>
<p>"You're family," Harry declared. "You and your mom and your dad and anyone else on your side of things."</p>
<p>The Black family magic surged, rocking Harry and making Tonks stagger and fall right on top of Dawlish. She whined, clutching her head as she battled the blocks inside of her. Harry grumbled and went to her, putting his hands atop hers while Madame Bones laid one hand on Tonks' back.</p>
<p>The blocks didn't break until Professor McGonagall added her magic to the mix. Then Tonks gasped and straightened up, eyes blazing as the Black family magic reclaimed her and her parents both. Harry felt the Black magic echoing through them and their elf who squeaked and laughed and spun the Black magic around and through her master and mistress.</p>
<p>"Oh, you need to bring them here," Harry breathed as he stared into Tonks' ever-changing eyes. Her whole face shifted as she stared back at Harry, but she always felt like herself magically. "They feel amazing, Tonks."</p>
<p>Madame Bones sighed and waved for a different auror to take Dawlish. "Hopefully, you'll be fine."</p>
<p>"Actually, I would expect that everyone in Britain is blocked," Aunt Petunia said in her utterly matter-of-fact voice that always rocked people back on their heels. "Why would that man restrict himself? He's had decades of shaping British magical society exactly as he chose. He would've blocked all of the students and anyone that he met that he could without being noticed."</p>
<p>"Everyone at the school but the first years are blocked," Harry agreed as he leaned against Tonks. "Well, everyone but the Weasley twins. They figured out how to free themselves."</p>
<p>"Damn it all," Madame Bones complained as she took off her monocle and rubbed her eyes. "Fine. I'll call the ICW in to check and free everyone in the Ministry if I have to."</p>
<p>"You have to," Tonks said. She latched onto Harry, hugging him tightly. "Trust me, ma'am. You have to. Pretty sure Dawlish here's blocked more'n most. Or he's just a wanker. Not sure which."</p>
<p>"I vote both," Dudley said, grinning at Tonks who grinned back at him in a kindred soul sort of way that made Harry distinctly nervous.</p>
<p>Harry pulled Tonks to the sofa tucked in a corner of Dumbledore's office so that he could cuddle up with her while Aunt Petunia chatted with Madame Bones. Dawlish got carted off by Professor McGonagall who sniffed and levitated him with a sharp little flick of her wand.</p>
<p>"I did wonder how you found all this out," Professor Flitwick asked once Dawlish and every auror but Madame Bones was gone.</p>
<p>He looked to Harry, but Harry shrugged and pointed to Aunt Petunia. Her telling of the whole story was much more concise than Harry's. She took just about three minutes instead of the hour and more it always took Harry. But then, she left everything interesting out like Aunt Marge and discovering Sirius was innocent and the Goblins and how the family magic was all furious about the blocks and the Dark Marks.</p>
<p>"Goodness, I suppose I should contact my family," Professor Flitwick said. He took off his glasses and polished them just like Harry used to when he needed to think.</p>
<p>"You really should," Harry told him. "The most important thing is freeing everyone from the blocks Dumbledore put on them. The family magic is really, really, really angry about that. And there's some sort of prophecy, too. I'm pretty sure it's about Dumbledore, not Voldemort."</p>
<p>No surprise, really, Tonks and Professor Flitwick both immediately needed to hear the prophecy and then ask a zillion questions about it that Harry couldn't answer. He thought they might have kept on going all day long and into the night if Professor Snape hadn't crept up the stairs to stare at Harry with haunted eyes.</p>
<p>"Who's he?" Dudley asked. He glared when Snape sneered at him. "Oh, Mum. Is that that Snape bloke you always complain about? He sure looked like that Snape wanker."</p>
<p>Aunt Petunia looked at Snape and Harry could've sworn that the temperature in Dumbledore's office dropped by a good fifty degrees. "Severus."</p>
<p>"Petunia," Professor Snape said with just as much ice. "I was hoping to speak to the… to Potter."</p>
<p>"Not by yourself, you're not," Tonks declared as Dudley rolled upright and glared at Snape with his hands clenched in fists.</p>
<p>"Also not without Aunt Petunia there," Harry said.</p>
<p>He wasn't at all surprised that Professor Snape stiffened and glared at Harry like he wanted to chop Harry's head off and spit down the hole, just like Uncle Vernon always threatened when the referees made bad calls on his favorite rugby team.</p>
<p>Harry shrugged. "If you won't accept that, then you can leave. I don't know what your problem is other than that you stalked my mum when she was little. I really don't much care. Say it or go away. Your choice."</p>
<p>"You are exactly like your father," Professor Snape snapped. He stepped into the room, standing on the very edge of the room as if going another inch into it would make him burst into flames.</p>
<p>"He's far more like Lily," Aunt Petunia said with a sigh and a shake of her head that was fond, not dismayed. "Other than the propensity of charging into situations without thinking. Though, honestly, Lily was terrible for that, too. She just didn't get caught."</p>
<p>Snape's expression went hungry the instant Aunt Petunia mentioned Harry's mum. He shuddered and rubbed his arm.</p>
<p>"Oh, you have the Dark Mark," Harry said.</p>
<p>"…How?" Professor Snape stared at Harry, visibly shaking.</p>
<p>"I saw Mr. Malfoy's mark," Harry said. "I'm surprised you're not dying."</p>
<p>That made Professor Snape go so dramatically pale that Harry expected him to pass out on the floor right there. He didn't. He gulped and raised his chin so that Harry had to stair up his nostrils and then nodded once as he pulled up the sleeve.</p>
<p>Where Mr. Malfoy's mark had been pulsing with power, red and angry on his arm, Professor Snape's mark was smooth and black. It looked like a real tattoo rather than the nasty magical trap that it was. Harry gestured and Snape stomped over so that Harry could very carefully touch the mark.</p>
<p>No family magic screamed inside Professor Snape. There was the faintest echo very far away of something that might have been family magic, but it was like a door had been locked between Snape and the magic. Maybe a big vault door like the ones leading to Silverclaw's office.</p>
<p>Worse, Professor Snape had only two blocks, little bitty ones that seemed to do not much of anything to make him change his behavior. They were pain blockers. Harry frowned as the Gryffindor magic explained in a wordless sort of way how they worked.</p>
<p>"I can't help you," Harry said. He pulled his fingers back only to squawk as Professor Snape grabbed his wrist and smushed his hand back against Snape's arm.</p>
<p>"Check again!" Professor Snape demanded. "There must be something you can do!"</p>
<p>"There's not," Harry said. "You don't have family magic trying to free you. You don't have blocks keeping you from being yourself. There's only a couple of pain blocks and I don't think taking them away would be a good thing. Without that force of magic from within trying to push the Dark Mark out, I can't make it go away."</p>
<p>"No," Professor Snape whispered as he staggered back a step. "I'm a Prince. I'm the last heir to the Prince bloodline. My mother was Eileen Prince! The Prince family magic should be inside me, waiting."</p>
<p>Harry stared at him, wishing he had that genealogy chart, but it was upstairs in his dorm room in his trunk. He'd not paid a bit of attention to the Prince bloodline because it hadn't seemed to be a living one and no one in it was closely related to the Potters or Blacks.</p>
<p>"Sir, I'm sorry but the only hints of family magic I get off you are locked away," Harry explained. "It's like there's something blocking you from it. Or it from you. I don't know which."</p>
<p>"Disowned?" Madame Bones asked.</p>
<p>She marched over and touched Professor Snape's mark. He glared at her, but he didn't pull his arm away from her. The hungry, desperate look strengthened as Madame Bones hummed, shut her eyes and went very still for a long moment.</p>
<p>"Your bloodline was disowned," Madame Bones said. "Ritually removed from the family magic. There are hints there but it's locked away. You'll never be able to claim it. I do remember your mother. She was ritually disowned and thrown out for marrying a muggle, yes?"</p>
<p>"Yes," Professor Snape whispered. His face was so pale that he looked green.</p>
<p>"Mmm, well, you're out of luck," Madame Bones said. "Harry's right. There's not a damned thing either of us can do for you. The Gryffindor and Hufflepuff magic can't latch onto anything inside of you because the family magic is gone. There's only your personal magic and that's not enough to work with."</p>
<p>Professor Snape whirled and stormed out of Dumbledore's office in a swirl of black robes that reminded Harry of a thundercloud about to burst into rain. He sighed and leaned into Tonks' side. What a mess. He'd really thought he could save everyone but apparently not.</p>
<p>"He's gonna be a problem," Tonks commented. Her eyes were a bright rainbow that shifted constantly but her dislike was obvious as she glared and pulled Harry almost all the way into her lap.</p>
<p>"He's a teacher here," Madame Bones said. "The Headmaster… oh. Huh. I guess that's not a problem now, is it?"</p>
<p>"You'll need to choose a new Headmaster or Headmistress," Aunt Petunia said. "That fool needs to be removed and replaced from his position immediately. He can't be allowed to remain. He never was the sort of person who should be a teacher."</p>
<p>"Always was the worst class," Tonks muttered to Harry.</p>
<p>"And we gotta find Dumbledore," Dudley exclaimed. "He got away! Can't let that go on."</p>
<p>"Yeah," Harry agreed. "All right. I'll talk to the professors and see who can and wants to do it. Aunt Petunia, we need to replace DADA, too. Voldemort was inside Professor Quirrell and when he was pulled out Professor Quirrell kinda died, so we need a new teacher there."</p>
<p>"I'll get everyone working on it," Aunt Petunia sighed. "You and Dudley had best go see how the students are doing."</p>
<p>"Yeah!" Dudley exclaimed. "I wanna go explore!"</p>
<p>"Not the third-floor right hand side," Madame Bones exclaimed as Harry squirmed free of Tonks and ran for the stairs with Dudley. "It's not cleaned up yet, you two!"</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am," Harry called over his shoulder. "Thank you!"</p>
<p>He escaped, running down the stairs with Dudley. Before he did anything else, though, he was going to find all the Hogwarts elves and see if he could help them. They needed it and their need was the loudest thing echoing in the Gryffindor magic. Elves, kids, new teachers, new headmaster; it'd all work out. Probably.</p>
<p>At least Aunt Petunia was here helping. That made it a lot easier to handle.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Filius smiled as Mrs. Dursley arrived in the staff break room with Madame Bones. Thank goodness. People in charge. He might yet be able to delivery this horrible wand to Ragnok.</p>
<p>"Ladies," Filius said with his most welcoming smile, the one that was entirely human and not at all goblin. "I'm glad to see you. I was hoping to run an errand, if you don't mind."</p>
<p>Both of them skewered Filius with looks that would do the most ferocious goblin proud. Filius deliberately didn't purse his lips or hold his hands to display his sadly human nails. They wouldn't understand the attempt to make himself more visibly harmless, anyway.</p>
<p>Instead he sighed and gestured for them to join him at the little group of armchairs that he and Minerva had tucked into the back of the break room. No one else was there, thankfully. The only reason Filius was there was that he'd been looking for Minerva and failing to find her anywhere.</p>
<p>"We're already dealing with a great deal of That Man's problems," Mrs. Dursley said severely enough that Filius did actually purse his lips and flash his fingernails. "Oh. You've goblin blood."</p>
<p>"…You're remarkably well educated for a squib," Filius said. He stared at her with fascination, especially as her pale cheeks turned pink.</p>
<p>"It was necessary to keep up with my sister Lily," Mrs. Dursley said. She chuckled and shook her head. "And to keep up with Harry, honestly. That boy. All my sister's curiosity and all her husband's talent for finding trouble by leaping in feet first."</p>
<p>"Oh dear." Filius laughed despite himself. "I've only had a handful of classes with our Mr. Potter so far. He's a brilliant student though and amazingly good at uniting the younger ones. Not so surprising given his heritage, I suppose. Which is neither here nor there. I have another bit of Dumbledore's trouble that must be managed."</p>
<p>Both Mrs. Dursley and Madame Bones stiffened. When Filius pulled out the Elder Wand, Madame Bones frowned and leaned closer. Mrs. Dursley stared at it for a long moment before putting her hand on Madame Bones' arm.</p>
<p>"What is it?" Mrs. Dursley asked with such ice in her voice and eyes that Filius would have sworn that her bit of magic was a gift for temperature control.</p>
<p>"There are legends of three items given to three brothers by Death," Filius said. He nodded to Mrs. Dursley. "I don't know how much of our myth and legend you've had time to absorb, but the Deathly Hallows are… famous."</p>
<p>"And fictional," Madame Bones protested but she leaned back in her chair as if she wanted to get as far away from the wand as possible now.</p>
<p>"Not fictional at all, actually," Filius said. "The Peverell brothers were real. They received a wand, a stone that would bring back the souls of the dead and a cloak that made the wearer invisible. This is the wand, the Elder Wand. It is, I fear, the reason that Dumbledore was so amazingly powerful."</p>
<p>"This is how he was so successful controlling everyone," Mrs. Dursley breathed, eyes hard with fury as she glared at the wand.</p>
<p>"Yes," Filius agreed. "I believe so. I've won it from him. It won't work as well for him anymore. But frankly, I'd much rather have it safely in the deepest vaults of the Gringotts than here. After Mr. Potter claimed the Gryffindor legacy, Dumbledore pulled a different wand. A much more troubling one."</p>
<p>He paused, stomach roiling and heart pounding just from the memory of that wand. Filius had been just a child, barely fifteen and looking more like a five-year-old human, when Grindelwald was defeated. Despite that, he remembered Grindelwald's wand. They'd had pictures of it in all the papers, discussions of why he'd chosen that wood, that fashioning, what it said about him.</p>
<p>"Whose?" Madame Bones whispered. She didn't look as though she wanted the answer.</p>
<p>"Someone worse?" Mrs. Dursley asked in a perfectly calm, diamond-calm tone even though her hands had gone white at the knuckles where she still gripped Madame Bones' arm.</p>
<p>"Grindelwald," Filius made himself say. "He pulled and used Grindelwald's wand. And I realized, after Fawkes took him away, after everything calmed down. I don't. I don't know if anyone knows, but I don't know. Do you know where Grindelwald's prison is? Has anyone been there to see if Grindelwald is still there? Still controlled?"</p>
<p>Madame Bones went as still as stone, only her eyes widening as her cheeks went marble-pale. Then she was up and cursing as she strode towards the door. Mrs. Dursley didn't pale. She raised her chin, pursed her lips and then nodded to Filius.</p>
<p>"Take that to the bank," Mrs. Dursley ordered. "Tell Silverclaw and Ragnok that we've another problem that we'll need help with. And tell them that I said you need to know the prophecy. I suspect that That Man's wand is going to be important to Harry's defeat of him."</p>
<p>"Yes ma'am," Filius said as he hopped off the chair and hurried towards the door.</p>
<p>It wasn't until he was through the floo to Gringotts before he thought to wonder at just how instantly he'd obeyed Mrs. Dursley. Perhaps her gift was vocal rather than temperature control.</p>
<p>Or maybe she was where Harry had learned how to lead others. She was, truly, a rather compelling individual. He'd have to gossip with Silverclaw about it, not that someone like Silverclaw was likely to be interested in spending time with a halfblood like Filius.</p>
<p>Still. It never hurt to ask. Sometimes you got the most fascinating answers.</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>Sixty million, jillion questions later, Harry and Dudley set out to explore Hogwarts together.</p>
<p>The students had, predictably and annoyingly, been told absolutely nothing at all. Professor Snape hadn't come back to the Great Hall. None of the teachers had. They'd not told the kids that they were free to head back to their dorms or the library or whatever. Harry was going to, but they mobbed him shouting questions until Dudley threatened to hit them with his Magic Fists of Doom.</p>
<p>Ron did get hit because he hadn't believed Dudley had Magic Fists of Doom.</p>
<p>He apologized and whined after getting up off the floor. Hermione had the most questions of everyone even though she'd been researching the whole Gryffindor thing for Harry. In the end, he'd had to ask Hermione to come along with him as he explored.</p>
<p>Neville, of course, was with Harry on his right-hand side while Dudley walked with Hermione, asking her as many questions about Hogwarts as she'd asked Harry about what had happened. They both seemed utterly delighted with that, so Harry was more than happy to leave them to it.</p>
<p>"Where are we going?" Neville asked as they headed down into the dungeons.</p>
<p>"I can feel the elves," Harry said, pointing ahead of them. "I'm worried about them. They've felt bad ever since I arrived, and now they feel afraid and bad, so I'm going to find them and see what I can do to help."</p>
<p>"Oh," Neville said with a nod. "The magic here has felt really off. It's better now, though."</p>
<p>"Mhm," Harry agreed as he stopped and frowned. "No, they feel behind me now."</p>
<p>"Oh, you have to tickle the pear," Hermione exclaimed when she realized that she and Dudley had walked straight past Harry and Neville. "The painting here is the entrance to the kitchen. Susan told me about it. She says that if you tickle the pear, that one there, it will open the door."</p>
<p>"How d'you tickle a pear?" Dudley asked.</p>
<p>"Do you always talk like that?" Hermione asked with a stiff little stare that was a lot like Aunt Petunia.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Dudley said with his biggest 'didn't get in trouble when I should have' grin. "It drives Mum and Aunt Marge batty. Totally worth it. I mean, I don't at school but anywhere Mum's around? Yeah. She gets all pinched in the face and tries not to scold me for it."</p>
<p>"She should scold you!" Hermione exclaimed as Harry exchanged a look with Neville and then set to tickling the pear. "You sound like a hooligan."</p>
<p>"Thanks!" Dudley said with so much delight that Harry snickered and Neville clapped a hand over his mouth. "That's just what I'm going for."</p>
<p>Thankfully, the door to the kitchen opened before Hermione could go into full-blown conniption mode. Or lecture mode. Harry wasn't sure which way she'd go, not when she looked that gobsmacked.</p>
<p>The kitchen was big and ancient looking, like something out of the middle ages with a huge, enormous fireplace that had a whole pig roasting in it. There were stoves and trestle tables laden with food in various stages of preparation. Pies and cakes and savory things and just everything you could think of to eat.</p>
<p>And House Elves.</p>
<p>About a hundred House Elves stood there, staring at Harry as he came in with the others on his heels. All of them were dressed in clean but very worn pillowcases. No shoes. Sad drooping ears. Big scared eyes.</p>
<p>"Oh wow, what did he do to you guys?" Harry said as he sat down on the floor in front of the oldest one who was shaking as she held a big bowl full of batter. "You're all so tired!"</p>
<p>"Master Gryffindor is caring?" the old elf asked. Tears welled up in her eyes.</p>
<p>"I am," Harry said. "Here, put that down and let me feed you some magic. The school's an utter mess magically. I need to have you guys help me clean it up. Not just, you know, the physical stuff. The magic needs cleaning, too."</p>
<p>Every single Elf straightened and stared at him hungrily. The old Elf burst into tears. She put the bowl of batter on the closest table and then popped into Harry's arms instead of walking. He hugged her and patted her back as she cried.</p>
<p>It was so obvious that they'd been starved of magic. A tiny little curl of the Gryffindor magic made her shiver and sigh like it was a tidal wave. Harry eased more into her and then tugged on a thread of magic in Hogwarts that felt like green things and flowers that weren't getting tended properly. Maybe something to do with the greenhouses? Or the Forbidden Forest. </p>
<p>He wasn't sure and it really didn't matter because the old Elf moaned and sagged in his arms as she worked with that magic and sent it back out cleaner and cleaner by the second. The instant Harry let her go, the other Elves swarmed on him, touching and patting, crying and praising him. </p>
<p>Harry let them. They needed this. He could feel it. Besides, it made him and the castle both feel way better so why not? This was what House Elves were best at.</p>
<p>Eventually, after about hour, maybe more, he'd gotten all the Elves some magic to support them and other magic for them to work on cleaning. Harry smiled because they all looked way, way better than before. Brighter expressions, much less grey skin. Still those awful pillowcases, though.</p>
<p>"Okay," Harry said. "I know you weren't allowed proper uniforms before but I'm really, really stubborn on the uniform thing. Kreacher," Harry started as Kreacher popped in next to him, "this is him. Kreacher can help you guys figure out good uniforms for the House Elves of Hogwarts to wear."</p>
<p>"Kreacher will do that," Kreacher promised. He scowled at Harry. "But Master Harry is needing to eat. He is not having dinner and is not having breakfast and now it is lunch and still Master Harry has not eaten."</p>
<p>"It's lunch?" Harry said, staring at Kreacher who nodded disapprovingly. Dudley was sitting with Hermione and Neville at a table with food in front of them. "Oh wow. I thought that took just barely an hour, not half the day."</p>
<p>Kreacher shook his head while the Hogwarts Elves stared at him disapprovingly. "Master Harry is as bad as Master Sirius. You is eating and lots. No arguing!"</p>
<p>Dudley snickered before coming and helping Harry up off the floor. His legs were kind of numb and his butt was cold so Harry appreciated the help. The food was even better than Harry remembered or maybe he was just that hungry. Either way, he plowed into the lunch Kreacher put in front of him with as little grace as Ron before the blocks were broken.</p>
<p>"Does he eat like that all the time?" Hermione asked.</p>
<p>"No," Neville and Dudley said at the same time.</p>
<p>"Jinx," Dudley said, lightly smacking Neville's shoulder and grinning. "Nah, he's just hungry."</p>
<p>"Normally he's way more polite than this," Neville agreed. "No punching. It's rude."</p>
<p>"Breaks the jinx," Dudley replied and shrugged.</p>
<p>"Is that actually a real thing?" Hermione asked. "Can you make a jinx for real if you have magic and do something at the same time as someone else?"</p>
<p>Harry wanted to respond to that, to ask questions with Hermione and maybe head to the library for books, but Kreacher glowered and shoved another sandwich in Harry's hands. So he ate instead.</p>
<p>Around them, the magic of the kitchen felt better and better. All of Hogwarts felt better. Well, not all of it. There were a couple of places that felt all wonky and wrong. One was below the dungeons which was kind of weird. The other was upstairs somewhere, on one of the upper levels.</p>
<p>"What's wrong with the gates?" Harry asked Kreacher.</p>
<p>"Voldeghost cursed Hogwarts," Crow exclaimed as she popped in to pass Hermione and Dudley a book on accidental magic. "Gate is cursed so that no ones can be Dark Arts professor long. Bad Dumbles didn't fix it even though he could."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm going to have to fix that," Harry complained. He shook his head. "Crow, can you please let Aunt Petunia know that Lacey should come and remove that curse? And Madame Bones. She needs to know, too. And there's something wrong with the sewers, I think. I'm not sure. It's weird."</p>
<p>"Crow will tell them!" Crow threw a sloppy salute that Kreacher groaned and grumbled over before popping away.</p>
<p>"Harry," Hermione stared at the spot where Crow had been. "I need books on House Elves. I need them badly."</p>
<p>"Me too!" Harry exclaimed even though Kreacher poked him to keep eating and then threw his hands up in disgust when Harry put the remnants of his second sandwich down. </p>
<p>"You can borrow the books I've got but none of them are very accurate," Harry continued. "They don't say a thing about the cleaning House Elves do for magic. Or the way that their magic shores up and reinforces family magic. I swear, I'm gonna find a good book yet or I'll write it myself. You know, when I'm older."</p>
<p>"I'll help," Hermione promised. Then she scowled at Harry. "Now eat your food, silly. You need it!"</p>
<p>Harry groaned and ate the rest of his second sandwich. At least after that, Kreacher gave him a pear to eat and some nice chocolate biscuits. By the time he was done eating, Hermione and Dudley were fast friends, reading the book on accidental magic together as if they had known one another their entire lives.</p>
<p>"He's good at making friends," Neville commented quietly to Harry once Harry gave the plates to the kitchen elves and Kreacher nodded approval.</p>
<p>"Not so much, really," Harry said. "I mean, sort of? It's weird with the curses we were under. Want to come with me as I try and figure out what's going on under the dungeons?"</p>
<p>"Under?" Dudley asked, proving he wasn't that invested in the book.</p>
<p>"There's only sewers under the dungeons," Hermione agreed. She shut the book and stored it in a beautiful bracelet on her wrist.</p>
<p>"Oh, is that a dimensional store?" Harry asked, beaming. "Aunt Petunia has one but it's only good for a key."</p>
<p>Hermione grinned. "Yes, it is. It's a library trunk, just one I can carry with me. I told my parents about it and they let me order one by owl post."</p>
<p>"I want one!" Harry said at the same time that Dudley did. </p>
<p>He hit Dudley's shoulder before Dudley could hit his shoulder, making Dudley laugh. Neville shook his head at them both, pulling Harry towards the door. All the elves waved to them. They looked and felt so much better now. That was good. Harry really didn't want the elves suffering anymore. Kreacher would get them proper uniforms that made sense for Hogwarts and they'd be safe and healthy and happy and they'd make the magic her healthier, too.</p>
<p>Which left the sewers, the whatever Dumbledore had been doing on the third floor, the curse on the gates and Dumbledore himself to deal with. Not too much, really.</p>
<p>Itzy popped in front of them.</p>
<p>"Master Harry is to come to Dumbles' office," Itzy declared. He smiled and took Dudley's hand when Dudley offered it. "Is very important. Mistress Pet is very upset. Very upset indeed. She has everyone coming."</p>
<p>"We'll be right there," Harry promised. He bit his lip. "Can you tell me what's wrong with the sewers? There's something not right there but I can't tell what it is."</p>
<p>Itzy blinked before closing his eyes. He frowned, cocked his head to left, then to the right. When he opened them, Itzy looked frustrated.</p>
<p>"Itzy is not sure what happened, but yes, is something wrong," Itzy said. "She is very sleepy and does not want to talk. She says she is waiting for her master to come back to feed her. She has not fed well in a long, long time. Her master was mean and blocked her way out to hunt in the forest, so she has not had yummy big spiders in a long, long time."</p>
<p>Both of Harry's eyebrows went up at that. "Um. She who?"</p>
<p>"Oh, basilisk in the sewers," Itzy said. He stared at Harry as if astonished that Harry didn't already know that. "She was put there to protect the school. Should Itzy open door so that she can hunt right?"</p>
<p>"Uh, I think so?" Harry said.</p>
<p>He wasn't at all ashamed that his voice came out super-high. Everything he'd read about magical creatures said that basilisks were horribly dangerous, incredibly rare and highly intelligent. Hermione looked just as horrified as Harry while Neville had his wand out like they were about to be attacked at any second.</p>
<p>"Who's the blighter who made her starve?" Dudley asked with way less concern and way more outrage than Harry thought was right. Except yeah, starving a very dangerous and highly intelligent creature was an outrage. Another one.</p>
<p>"Riddle," Itzy said. "She says he said born-name was Riddle. But chosen name was stupid so she won't say it."</p>
<p>"We're gonna have to tell Aunt Petunia about this," Harry said. "Either way, please do open her door. I don't want anyone to be hungry, even scary monsters. Um. Tell her that I said she's not to hurt anyone at the school if she can help it. And that um, she should talk to the elves if she needs anything else."</p>
<p>Itzy nodded and bowed his head.  A moment later, he bounced, grinned at Dudley and then popped away. Hermione blew out a breath.</p>
<p>"Harry, your life is so incredibly weird," Hermione said.</p>
<p>"It is!" Dudley said, laughing so hard that it echoed all up the hallway. "It really is! Come on. We gotta tell Mum about the basilisk and then we gotta ask for library bracelets. I could wear one and use it, Harry."</p>
<p>"I know!" Harry said, grinning. "That'd be brilliant."</p>
<p>"What books do you have?" Dudley said, turning to Hermione with so much enthusiasm that she blushed. "Harry's got some amazing ones, especially in his Inaccurate Information one. They're a hoot."</p>
<p>Harry blew out a breath as Dudley and Hermione started in on questioning each other at high speed again. If they were a couple of years older, Harry would have said that it was flirting. Really silly flirting. Not that he thought Hermione would be bad for Dudley or vice versa.</p>
<p>Actually, that might be nice. Hermione as part of his family would be wonderful. Her magic was wonderful and she didn't condescend to Dudley because he was a squib. Hm. Maybe he'd mention it privately to Aunt Petunia.</p>
<p>Or maybe not.</p>
<p>No reason to make Hermione that nervous, not when they were all so young and there were so many more important things to take care of. Like basilisks in the sewers and curses on the gates. Really, what had Dumbledore been doing, anyway?</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Lacey hurried into the Headmaster's office, trailing behind Professor McGonagall and Madame Bones. You'd think that she'd have gotten used to the Black elves popping in with a command performance from Petunia. It'd happened so many times since that wonderful, infuriating, horrible dinner party where everything had changed for the better.</p>
<p>She hadn't gotten used to it. The connection to Zing, his enthusiasm for helping Lacey and Anthony with anything they wanted, or even Zing's delight in wearing socks in rainbow colors underneath his uniform continually surprised her. </p>
<p>Who knew that it would be house elves that knocked her on her arse? She would have bet on it being accepted in the Black family magic instead. And then lost money.</p>
<p>The Headmaster's office was spelled to be just big enough for everyone in it, while still being comfortably cozy. It felt like a very old spell, one that had sunk deep into the stones generations before Lacey was conceived. There were some squiggly bits of magic on top of it that made her frown, but it was hard to focus on them when the office was so welcoming.</p>
<p>"What?" Petunia asked Lacey.</p>
<p>She held up a hand to forbid both Anthony and a very surprising Vernon from saying anything further. They'd obvious taken the floo since both of them still had soot on their suits. Vernon looked excited, more excited than she'd ever seen him. Anthony had that manic look in his eyes that said she'd be sitting back and listening to him enthuse about something big soon.</p>
<p>"There's… an edge to the spells in here that's making me uncomfortable," Lacey said just as Harry and Dudley pushed past her with two of Harry's friends coming after them. "The spells that make it so nice in here are making it hard to figure out just what's bothering me."</p>
<p>"That Man." Petunia huffed. "There's a curse on the front gates that will need to be removed, Lacey. Once you've done that, I'll have you spend some time tracking down what's wrong here. I've no doubt That Man did something."</p>
<p>She turned to Amelia, leaving Lacey huffing with outrage that Dumbledore had left a curse on the gates to a school full of children. Petunia's lips went very thin while Amelia raised her chin and glowered as if she was getting ready to go into battle.</p>
<p>"The boys figured out what's in the sewers," Petunia said and now she just looked very tired. "Apparently, someone put a basilisk in there ages ago and Voldemort sealed the doors so that the basilisk couldn't feed. Itzy's made it possible for the basilisk to go hunt, but we'll need to do something to get it out of here."</p>
<p>"A what?" Lacey squawked at the same time that Amelia did. </p>
<p>Anthony's jaw dropped open. Vernon looked to Harry and Dudley. It was their friend with the bushy hair who pulled a book from her dimensional store, paging through it and then whispering an explanation to Vernon that sent him to huffing and going red in the face with outrage, too.</p>
<p>"Um, why are we here, Aunt Petunia?" Harry asked.</p>
<p>Petunia sighed and ran her fingers carefully through Harry's hair. It stubbornly refused to obey, springing back into its messy mop of curls just the way Anthony's hair loved doing. Harry blushed and leaned into her hand, smiling shyly at her.</p>
<p>"Professor Flitwick brought a problem to us and exposed a very large issue," Petunia said. "That Man was using Grindelwald's wand before he escaped. This could be understandable but apparently no one knows where Grindelwald's prison is but That Man."</p>
<p>Silence stretched as Lacey, and everyone else other than Amelia who seemed to have already figured it out, put the pieces together. They weren't just facing Dumbledore. They were facing both Dumbledore and Grindelwald, the greatest Dark Lord the magical world had ever dealt with.</p>
<p>"We have to find them," Harry said. He squared his shoulders and stared up into Petunia's eyes with the same determination as Vernon with his rugby or Petunia with a very proper tea party to throw. "We have to find them, and we have to stop them before they hurt anyone else."</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>Harry glared at the stairs leading up the headmaster's office. "This isn't fair."</p>
<p>"No, it's not," Dudley agreed with a ferocious scowl that probably matched Harry's scowl. "We could help. We've had some really good ideas."</p>
<p>"Yeah, but we're kids," Neville said like the voice of reason he always was. "We don't know enough to really do any good. We should let the grownups handle it."</p>
<p>"I really want to do some research," Hermione said as her hair drifted around her head. "But I don't know if the books in the library are even reliable now."</p>
<p>"What into?" Dudley asked.</p>
<p>He put an arm around Harry's shoulders, squeezing Harry hard enough to make Harry wheeze. It didn't do much to calm Harry down. Nothing was going to do that, not when he'd been sent off to 'go play with your friends' when Harry was the one with the stupid prophecy about him. He was going to be involved in fixing it all somehow. Cutting him out of figuring out the solution was just mean.</p>
<p>Stupid grownups treating him like a kid who couldn't do anything.</p>
<p>"Dumbledore," Hermione answered. She smoothed her hands over her hair and then huffed when it drifted right back up again. "Grindelwald. The whole war against Grindelwald and the one against Voldemort. What Dumbledore's supposed to have done and who said he did it."</p>
<p>"Yeah," Harry said with a sigh. "The library's not going to do much good on those subjects. We already know that Dumbledore was controlling people's minds. He's not going to have let them write anything useful down."</p>
<p>"No, but you have the Inaccurate Information trunk," Neville said slowly. He bit his lip and then shrugged when Harry turned to him. "If everyone's been getting the wrong information, if Dumbledore's been sculpting what they think and feel and do, maybe the Inaccurate Information isn't as inaccurate as it seems?"</p>
<p>It wasn't the same as finding Nurmengard or Dumbledore. It wasn't listening and helping as Aunt Petunia and Lacey and Anthony and everyone else figured out where to find Dumbledore and then take him down, just like they'd taken down Voldemort. But it was something to do.</p>
<p>"Right," Harry said. "Let's get all the trunks and go to the library. Hermione, you get any Ravenclaw books you can find that aren't supplied by the school. Neville, Dudley, let's see who we can gather and what books they can find from the other houses."</p>
<p>"I think the upper years are out playing quidditch," Neville said, "but there's some first years who decided to stay inside. I'll get them."</p>
<p>"Me, too," Hermione said. "I know there's some Ravenclaws who think quidditch is ridiculous."</p>
<p>"They're mental!" Dudley groaned. "Quiddich is the best game ever!"</p>
<p>Dudley blinked and then went red as a beet when Harry stared at him for quoting Uncle Vernon. Not just quoting him but using Uncle Vernon's exact tone of voice for 'Rugby's the best game ever' rants. At least it stopped Dudley from ranting like Uncle Vernon, who really should've been at work instead of Hogwarts. They all ran off on their errands.</p>
<p>Pretty quickly, in less than half an hour, they had a hoard of students in the library annoying Madame Pince who eventually threw her hands up and retreated to her office muttering threats against them all. The elves helped with so much delight that Harry found himself grinning every time a Hogwarts elf popped in with food or tea or treats or even more paper and quills for people to use.</p>
<p>"Oh," Harry said, smacking himself in the forehead. "Shimmer, I need your help."</p>
<p>Shimmer, the old elf that Harry had helped first in the kitchen immediately popped to his side. She'd replaced her battered old pillowcase with a lovely little dress made out of thick new pillowcases all covered with big pink cabbage roses. She already looked much better, but Harry still held out his hands and gave her a little trickle of magic to clean.</p>
<p>"Master Gryffindor needs Shimmer?" Shimmer asked, beaming at him as she swiftly cleaned the magic and let it loose again.</p>
<p>"I do," Harry said. "We're pretty sure that Dumbledore removed bunches and bunches of books from the library. He probably hid them away somewhere. Can you and the other Hogwarts elves help us find all the missing things he took away?"</p>
<p>Shimmer bit her lip. "Is many, many things, Master Gryffindor. Many things. Is a special room where they're kept. Is a very big special room."</p>
<p>"Oh," Harry said, surprised. "Um, well, why don't we start with books, then? I think Madame Pince would like all her books back."</p>
<p>"Would like it," Shimmer agreed with a firm nod. "Mistress Booksy has complained many times about lost books. We's go find all the books and bring them back. Master Gryffindor tells Mistress Booksy or she gets mad about the mess. Is lots and lots and lots of books."</p>
<p>Harry opened his mouth and then just nodded when he wasn't sure what to say to 'lots and lots' of books. Shimmer popped away, as did all the other elves in the library. That caught everyone's attention. The elves had been so active and in their faces that the sudden disappearance was a shock.</p>
<p>"Um, I asked them to go find any lost books or books that Dumbledore took away," Harry explained. "I've um, gotta go tell Madame Pince or she might be angry at the sudden influx."</p>
<p>"I'll go with you," Neville immediately volunteered. He stood from the table, moving to Harry's side as Dudley, Hermione and Blaise all looked at each other with delight.</p>
<p>"I'll keep things organized here," Draco said. "You'd better hurry. My mother claimed that there's literally over a million books missing."</p>
<p>A million…</p>
<p>Harry ran over to Madame Pince's office door, rapping on it urgently. She came to the door with a black glower that would've normally made Harry quail at her, but not this time. He took a deep breath and then started as the first stacks of books appeared near Draco.</p>
<p>"Um, I asked the elves to go find and bring back all the lost and hidden books," Harry told Madame Pince. "Because I figured that Dumbledore took them so that no one would learn the things he didn't want them to. And um. Draco's mom said that there's more than a million missing books so where do you want them?"</p>
<p>"What?" Madame Pince stared at him.</p>
<p>The first stack of books was taller than Harry, teetering until Draco and Hermione caught it with their hands. When the second popped in, it was taller still. Then the third appeared, and a fourth, all of them as tall as a grown man, not Hagrid-tall but definitely Uncle Vernon-tall, and wobbly. The stack filled inwards until the book towers became a book heap that grew until it really was as tall as Hagrid.</p>
<p>Then a second stack of books began to grow, and a third, and a fourth, all of them dusty and unloved. Some of them looked like they hadn't been touched in easily fifty, a hundred years. Harry stared for a second before turning back to Madame Pince.</p>
<p>Tears flowed down her cheeks. She had both of her hands pressed over her mouth. She shook her head when Harry put a hesitant hand on her elbow.</p>
<p>"Mr. Potter," Madame Pince said in a tear-choked voice, "this is… This is a wonder. A blessing. Thank you."</p>
<p>"You're welcome?" Harry said, confused and blushing. "We just wanted to see if we could find any information about Dumbledore and Grindelwald and Nurmengard. You know, to help the grownups so that they can go find Dumbledore and stop him. But wow. I didn't expect this many books. It's going to take forever to sort through them."</p>
<p>Madame Pince laughed and sobbed at the same time. "No, it won't. The library will help us, Mr. Potter. We just have to ask her."</p>
<p>She slowly stepped out into the library which somehow seemed bigger than it had before. Expansion charms maybe?</p>
<p>No, the Castle hummed happily like it had been forced to make the library smaller than it should be and now it could make it right again. Harry put one hand on the wall next to Madame Pince's office. The feeling off happiness increased so much that Harry found himself laughing and leaning into the wall.</p>
<p>"Harry?" Neville asked. "You're giggling."</p>
<p>"Sorry," Harry said, grinning at him. "The Castle is so happy. It's making the library right again. Big enough for all the books."</p>
<p>The kids, led by Ron who was loud and obnoxious about them getting the bloody hell out of the middle of the library and to the wall where Harry was, came to join Harry and Neville. Ron had to go back and drag both Hermione and Dudley because they were grabbing books off stacks and exclaiming over them instead of listening.</p>
<p>"Stop arguing with me!" Ron snapped at Dudley. "It's not safe for us out there. What? You want a bookcase to land on your head?"</p>
<p>Dudley blew a raspberry at Ron. "How's that supposed to happen? Bookcases don't come from nowhere."</p>
<p>In the middle of the library, Madame Pince started glowing. Her magic was the color of old parchment, threaded through with glowing brown lines that looked just like indecipherable writing. Her full skirts shifted around her ankles as she bowed her head, blew out a breath and then snapped her head upright to stare towards the ceiling.</p>
<p>Magic swept outwards from her, enveloping the books and then the shelves and desks and walls. It whipped around the room, startling the girls into shrieks as it flipped their skirts skyward and yelps as it pushed all the boys back against the wall.</p>
<p>"Catalogus!" Madame Pince shouted.</p>
<p>She pointed her wand at the closest stack of books. For a moment the magic just swirled around the room and then the books took flight. A bookcase soared down out of the ceiling, from nowhere, thumping into the floor with a crash that took Harry's breath from him. The flying books smacked onto the shelves, ordering themselves, except there were some that flew to the bookshelves that were already there and others on the shelves that flew to the new bookcase.</p>
<p>When Madame Pince pointed at the next pile, the storm of books grew. As fast as she pushed the books into the cataloging spell, more stacks of books popped in.</p>
<p>In moments, the library was a hurricane of books, pages flapping, bookcases thumping down from nowhere, flying in from the walls, rearing up out of the stones. Their little patch of wall by Madame Pince's office remained unchanged but Harry would have sworn that they were pulled further and further away from her as the library grew and grew.</p>
<p>And grew.</p>
<p>Hermione clung to Draco's arm while Draco sheltered both Susan and Hannah against the wall. Dudley had placed himself with Neville in front of Harry, barely letting him see what was happening between their shoulders. Blaise was mouthing curses, or maybe prayers, that Harry couldn't hear over the flapping and thumping and roar of Madame Pince's magic.</p>
<p>Ron stood and watched it all happen, nodding approvingly. When a bookshelf soared out of the ceiling straight at him, Ron calmly stepped to the side and let it whump into the floor inches from his toes.</p>
<p>Then he grinned.</p>
<p>Harry opened his mouth to shout at Ron, to ask what he was so happy about, but silence suddenly fell.</p>
<p>No books flying. No bookshelves moving. Nothing but the sound of twenty or so kids panting as they slowly straightened up.</p>
<p>"That's done it," Ron said entirely too happily. "It's right now. All fixed up. The destiny of the Dark Lord of the Light and the Light Lord of Darkness is at hand, sorted and indexed for the Child of Destiny to reveal."</p>
<p>"…You Saw it?" Harry asked very hesitantly as he pushed his way between Dudley and Neville so that he could get at Ron.</p>
<p>Ron's eyes were glowing but very distant when he turned to smile at Harry. "Yeah, mate. How not? It's right there in front… of… us."</p>
<p>Ron's eyes slowly rolled up and then he toppled forwards. Harry, Dudley and Neville grabbed for him, keeping Ron from braining himself on the floor. Dudley and Neville had longer arms, so they caught Ron, which left Harry to run into the newly huge and newly labyrinthine library to Madame Pince.</p>
<p>When he found her, Madame Pince was sitting on the floor, panting. Her hair had come loose from its normal bun and her hat was on her knee. Shimmer and Pot were patting her hands comfortingly. Shimmer smiled at Harry as he skidded to a stop and then knelt at Madame Pince's side.</p>
<p>"That was brilliant!" Harry declared even as Madame Pince laughed softly at him. "Terrifying but brilliant. I had no idea library magic was that amazing. But um, Ron's apparently just had his first real vision? He's gifted with Sight, you see, and his eyes were glowing, and he said we'd find what we need in minutes now but then he passed out."</p>
<p>"Oh, dear," Madame Pince said. "Goodness, we'd best call his family. And Poppy. He'll need a bit of care. First visions can be quite exhausting."</p>
<p>Harry nodded. "Shimmer, can you let the twins know? And Percy, too. They'll want to be there for Ron when he wakes up."</p>
<p>"Shimmer goes," Shimmer said. She pointed at the table that they'd been using before the books came back. "We's left your books there. Should we adds them to the library, too?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no, some of them are entailed to the Potter family," Harry said. "We'll take care of those. Go on."</p>
<p>Shimmer popped out, leaving Harry and Pot to help Madame Pince up. She was unsteady on her feet for a few steps but then she got her legs back and strode off towards her office with complete confidence in her path.</p>
<p>Harry tried not to walk on her heels as he followed her, waving Pot off back to his duties. Madame Pince might know where to find things in the library, but he sure didn't. Though it was going to be a ton of fun finding out just what there was to read now. So many new books, so many things to learn.</p>
<p>And maybe, if Ron's vision was right, they'd find what they needed to deal with Dumbledore and Grindelwald, too.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>"Molly-wobbles!"</p>
<p>Molly scowled at the interruption in her work. She had so many potions she needed to finish. The orders lately had been unbearable, ten, twenty times what she was used to. Every spare inch of space on her workbenches were filled with sterilized bottles, stoppers, wire to bind the tops. The cauldron hadn't stopped bubbling since school started, except between batches when she had to clean it out.</p>
<p>Frankly, she needed to clean it badly right now. The last set of potions, a triple batch of obedience potions keyed to the strongest levels possible without making them toxic, had left residue in her biggest cauldron that was going to have to be scrubbed out by hand. There was no time for that, though, because she still had another hundred doses of the obedience potion to make and so little time to get it done in.</p>
<p>It was enough to make her pull her hair out.</p>
<p>There was no use in protesting, though. No one else could create these potions. Molly could hear Albus' voice in her head, thrumming behind her eyes, filling her ears, coating her tongue like one of the potions had been poured into her tea when she hadn't noticed. Ridiculous thought. Albus would never do something like that.</p>
<p>He needed her. He needed Molly's potion gifts, her ability to work away for hours without losing focus, her capacity for doing multiple potions at once. Though honestly, that was just proper staging and preparation. Bottling one potion while another was brewing while you gathered to ingredients for a third; simple. </p>
<p>Either way, there was only her, slaving away over her cauldron for the Greater Good. Which she should get back to. Maybe the residue in her big cauldron was light enough that she could get away with not scrubbing it out? Hm…</p>
<p>"Molly?" Arthur's voice broke through the need, the near-compulsion, to go back to brewing potions for Albus. "It's Ron. Apparently, there's been a problem at school. He needs us."</p>
<p>She whirled and strode to the door to her workshop by the kitchen. Her heavy leather work-apron spun off and hung itself by the door. Her normal apron, the red-and-white gingham one that Ginny had embroidered with ladybugs, flipped itself over her head and tied itself around her waist.</p>
<p>Grim determination to get back to her potions work flipped into ferocious concern for Ron the instant her hand touched the doorknob. Molly strode through the door, the wards Dumbledore had so kindly cast for her embracing her and cleansing her of all fumes and taints from the potions. She flung the door shut behind her in complete faith that Dumbledore's wards would keep it from slamming and harming the potions inside.</p>
<p>It always seemed so bright outside of her potions workshop. Molly blinked several times, eyes watering, before she could focus on Arthur's worried face. He was in his work clothes, a nice tweed suit with the jumper she'd knitted for him under an old open-front dark brown robe. He was so very pale, though. His faint freckles stood out vividly on his cheeks.</p>
<p>"What happened?" Molly asked as she offered her hands to him.</p>
<p>"We just got a floo from Madame Pince," Arthur said, clutching Molly's hands. "I was about to head back to the office, back to work. Startled me rather badly to suddenly have her there in the floo. But she said that Ron's had a Vision. A true Seeing. Then he passed out cold, poor boy. He's in the infirmary. The boys are there, taking care of him but Percy asked us to come right away. Where Ginny? I've already sent for Bill and Charlie. No idea if Charlie will show up but I had to try."</p>
<p>"She went to visit Luna," Molly said, glancing at the grandfather clock. Ron's hand did say 'infirmary' while Ginny's said 'flower-crowns'. Both Bill and Charlie's hands said 'traveling', so they were on their way. "Goodness, we need to go get her. She'll want to make sure Ron's not hurt herself."</p>
<p>"Agreed," Arthur said. "I'll go get Ginny. You head through to Hogwarts. Madame Pince is waiting for you to come through."</p>
<p>The floo was still burning green. Molly hesitated, heart pounding. She did still have so much work to do… but no. Not now. It was Ron, her baby boy. She threw on her favorite jumper and then strode through the floo, leaving Arthur to go gather up Ginny and come after her.</p>
<p>She needed her whole family together. She needed to be sure Ron was all right. Nothing was as important as that, not even the Greater Good.</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>Oddly, the infirmary wasn't as scary as Harry expected from the twins' warnings or Sirius and Remus' stories. It was a big open room with little curtains that would station themselves around a bed to give the occupant privacy, but it was warm and comforting despite the size and the beds were surprisingly comfortable.</p>
<p>Not the chairs. Those were horribly stiff and hard. Harry'd sat in one for a few seconds and then promptly sat on the end of Ron's bed even though he really shouldn't have. Percy was sitting by Ron at the head of the bed, freckles standing out starkly against his milk-pale face as he carefully combed his fingers through Ron's hair. Fred and George paced at the end of Ron's bed, moving like mirrors of each other along parallel five-foot paths.</p>
<p>"He'll be fine, dearies," Madame Pomfrey said. She'd done a diagnostic spell that the twins had watched like hawks and then just tucked Ron in. Now she was just passing by on her way to the door to the infirmary. "A good night's sleep and a good meal is all he needs. First visions can be very taxing. There's a reason that few people develop the skill, you know. It's hard on the body and mind when you open yourself up to infinity."</p>
<p>"How does Professor Trelawney figure in that?" Harry asked because he had to say something. All three of the awake Weasley's rolled their eyes and made little scoffing noises.</p>
<p>Madame Pomfrey looked horribly sad. "Just because you have the Gift, doesn't mean that it's useful or that you can deal with what you see, Mr. Potter. Sybill's family has a bit of a curse, I'm afraid. She's doing the best she can within it."</p>
<p>"…Has anybody tried to remove the curse?" Harry asked after a moment where he just accepted that, then another where he really thought about what she'd just said, and then a final moment of pure outrage that anyone would let her suffer under a curse like he'd suffered and not do a damn thing about it.</p>
<p>Madame Pomfrey stared at him, eyebrows rising at his tone and his glare. Before she could answer, the door flung open and a frowsy middle-aged woman in a cute gingham apron and a horrible orange and pink button-front jumper rushed in.</p>
<p>"Ron!" she shouted.</p>
<p>"He's just sleeping, Mum," Percy said immediately. He stood and waved her over. "No damage at all. Apparently, he passed out after having a vision."</p>
<p>"What in the world?" exclaimed Molly Weasley, recipient of the payments that should've gone to support Harry. "Ron have a vision? I've never heard such a thing. No one in our family has ever had visions before."</p>
<p>She brushed past Harry, outright pushing him off the bed so that she could sit in his place. Harry jerked at the way her magic screamed inside of her. It wasn't just Weasley magic. There was another family's magic, old and deep, that howled with outrage over the blocks. And over something else though Harry couldn't tell what it was in the short seconds that Molly's hand had rested on his shoulder.</p>
<p>"Easy," Fred whispered to Harry as he caught Harry and kept him from falling to the floor. "She's on one of her rampages."</p>
<p>"Gets like this after she's been brewing too long," George agreed in a low murmur that somehow came out quieter than Fred's whisper. "Let Percy handle her. He's got it down to an art."</p>
<p>Not ten seconds later, a ginger-haired man and a little girl with Weasley red hair and Weasley freckles and another of the horrible jumpers ran into the infirmary. They were followed by two other red-haired men, both of whom looked remarkably like Ron, just older and way cooler-looking.</p>
<p>Draco was outside. So was Susan and Neville and Hermione. And Pansy, too. Oh yeah. Something else he needed to take care of.</p>
<p>"I'll be right back," Harry murmured to Fred and George. "I'll bet they're all blocked. Don't touch if you can help it."</p>
<p>Fred and George nodded, though it lasted all of two seconds as Ginny latched onto George's waist to cling to him desperately. Harry ran out to the others, pulling Blaise and Pansy off to the side. They both stared at him, confused, before craning their necks to look into the infirmary where Molly was sobbing loudly about her baby boy being injured even though both Percy and Madame Pomfrey were reassuring her that no, Ron was just sleeping.</p>
<p>Maybe he could sleep through the racket because he snored twice as loudly?</p>
<p>Harry shook his head and focused on Blaise and Pansy. "Look, I've got to choose someone to be the Heir of Slytherin. Right now. You two are the best choices. Kreacher thinks your mother is very scary, Blaise."</p>
<p>"She is!" Blaise exclaimed as he put his hands behind his back as if afraid Harry might touch him. "That's a terrible idea. I don't know what Mum would do, but it wouldn't be good for anyone."</p>
<p>"My dad will have a fit," Pansy hissed at Harry. "He'll say that it should've gone to him, not me."</p>
<p>"That's what Kreacher said," Harry agreed. "But he's not here and I don't know him. I get to choose who, and I already know it can't go to Draco. The Malfoy magic is too protective of him and Mr. Malfoy. It won't accept the Slytherin magic. That leaves you. Will you? I mean, I know it's really sudden, but honestly, it doesn't have to be super-dramatic. I did that because of Dumbledore being awful."</p>
<p>Pansy snorted a laugh, wrinkling her nose as she grinned at Harry. "He was horrible, wasn't he? Why now? Can't it wait?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't think it can," Harry said. </p>
<p>He rubbed his chest which ached not just from worry for Ron but from the Gryffindor magic and the Black magic and the Potter magic all rumbling unhappily about Dumbledore and the Weasleys and everything that had happened.</p>
<p>"No, it can't," Harry said. "We need the Slytherin magic and we need it right now. We gotta save the Weasley's. They're key somehow and I think Mrs. Weasley might be just what we need to figure out just what Dumbledore was doing and how."</p>
<p>Pansy bit her lip, looking to the other Slytherins there. Draco nodded encouragingly. Blaise still had his hands behind his back, but he gave Pansy a firm nod that she should do it. Dudley nodded to her, too, and Hermione gave Pansy a thumb's up which made Pansy blink in confusion for a second and then laugh softly.</p>
<p>"All right, what do I do?" Pansy said. She scowled. "You're going to help me tell my parents, you know. I'm not telling them by myself."</p>
<p>"I promise," Harry said. He held out his hands and then smiled as Pansy took them. "As Heir of the Potter Family and my parents Lily and James Potter, the conquerors of Slytherin, I choose you, Pansy Parkinson, as the new holder of the Slytherin Magic."</p>
<p>He hesitated as shimmering silver-green magic welled up around them like grass or a pool or maybe like a cloak resting on the floor. It wasn't the same shade as the Potter magic, a more pure yellow shade of green, but then the Potter magic that stirred inside of him seemed to have shifted more towards the blue end of the green scale. Teal, maybe?</p>
<p>Huh. He hadn't known that he'd been using Slytherin magic all this time. Interesting.</p>
<p>Pansy's eyes were very wide, but her hands didn't shake at all in Harry's. "I accept."</p>
<p>"Will you swear to protect people?" Harry asked without any intent to speak. The words just spilled out of his mouth. "Will you swear to guard Magic Herself above your own interests? Will you work to bring safety and security to the magical world in every way possible?"</p>
<p>Pansy started shivering as the Slytherin magic crept up her legs and then slung around her shoulders. "I swear to protect all people, not just magical people or purebloods. I will work to bring everyone safety and security, in the magical world and outside of it, in every way I can. I swear to work by myself and with the other Founders' Heirs to guard Magic Herself above my own interests and my own survival. if necessary."</p>
<p>Harry expected something dramatic. For the magic to whoosh around him and Pansy, to make the castle quake or even something as simple as a chiming sound. Instead, the Slytherin magic left Harry entirely and wrapped Pansy in a silver-green glow. It seeped into her until her eyes glowed and her mouth fell open in shock.</p>
<p>"Oh," Pansy said. "Oh my."</p>
<p>Then the glow was gone, and the hallway was normal except that Harry felt lighter and more right as Pansy laughed. She pressed her hands to her chest, tears dripping down her cheeks. Blaise leaned closer, peering at Pansy's face.</p>
<p>"Leave off," Pansy ordered as she pushed him back, hand firm against his forehead. "I'm fine. That was… that was brilliant, Harry."</p>
<p>"I feel better," Harry said with a grin that Pansy mirrored. "Wanna come help me, Susan and the twins free their family?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely," Pansy declared.</p>
<p>Susan bit her lip but followed Harry and Pansy into the infirmary with a firm stride. Neville and Dudley followed like honor guards and Draco came afterwards with Blaise and Hermione.</p>
<p>Somehow, the magic binding the Weasley's was much more obvious now that he wasn't holding the Slytherin magic. Removing that extra burden let Harry see things more clearly, like the Slytherin magic was dust and smudges on his glasses and now it was gone. The magic around the Weasleys was ugly and cruel, warping Molly's soul and suppressing Arthur's so much that Harry was surprised that Arthur was even awake. The oldest Weasley son, the one with long hair and an earring, didn't feel blocked at all. The next oldest, Harry thought his name was Charlie from the complaints Ron had made about his brothers being amazing and him being nothing, was shorter and very strong. He wasn't blocked, either.</p>
<p>Ginny was profoundly blocked. To the point that it made Harry's skin crawl.</p>
<p>"That is so wrong," Pansy whispered to Harry.</p>
<p>"I know," Harry whispered back. "Come on. Let's help them. Everyone grab one and we'll free them. The magic knows how. It'll just be tiring."</p>
<p>Both Susan and Pansy nodded. Harry took a deep breath and stepped close to Molly, putting one hand on her shoulder even though Arthur frowned at him and Percy shivered. Behind him, Ginny squeaked and then Arthur gasped.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" Molly asked. </p>
<p>She turned, staring at him with eyes that were blank other than the shimmer of magic that blocked the color of her eyes. Harry gritted his teeth and pushed hard with his magic, with the Potter and Black magic, with the raging red-gold ocean that was the Gryffindor magic. </p>
<p>The shimmer resisted.</p>
<p>Molly sat, open mouthed and panting as she was caught between Dumbledore's compulsions and all the magic Harry could bring to bear to save her. Her own magic struggled inside of her, but it wasn't getting through.</p>
<p>"Mum!" Percy gasped.</p>
<p>He flung his arms around Molly's shoulders, burying his face against her hair. Then Bill reached across Ron's bed. Charlie grabbed at Bill's shoulder and poured magic into Bill where it surged onwards to Molly. Harry grabbed their magic and held on.</p>
<p>Still not enough.</p>
<p>Harry yelped as Pansy grabbed his elbow. Then Susan's magic joined Pansy's and then Ginny and Arthur and the twins were pouring magic through Harry into Molly as they tried to save her. It didn't work. No matter how Harry tried to pull the shimmer of Dumbledore's magic away, it resisted, and she stayed blocked.</p>
<p>"Open the door," Ron whispered. His eyes were barely open but the glowed brightly in a pure, white light that was all Ron. Or maybe it was something else looking through Ron's eyes, talking with Ron's voice. "Open the door, Harry."</p>
<p>Door. There was a door in Molly's head, one that felt oily and slimy like Dumbledore's spell over Quirrell's fallen body. Harry gritted his teeth and then grabbed that door in Molly's head. There was a jolt of pure power straight through him, a scream that seemed to erupt from multiple mouths at once, but then the door opened and all the Weasley magic surged through. Then the Potter and the Slytherin and the Black and Bones and the Gryffindor and everyone's magic plunged into Molly.</p>
<p>Dumbledore's blocks on her exploded into shimmering silver fragments that rained down around them.</p>
<p>Harry wheezed and then collapsed forward into Molly's lap. She was free. They were all free. Finally.</p>

  <p>Molly's hands shook as she cautiously opened the door to the Burrow. It'd taken hours before she'd woken up. Hours after that before she could sit up, could speak, could get across to everyone just how worried she was about the potions that she'd left behind in her workshop.</p>
<p>Granted, Molly couldn't exactly remember what they were but the darkness in her thoughts around them bothered her. The entire thing bothered her far more than she wanted to admit. Honestly, that everyone could see that she was upset was bad enough. She might wear her heart on her sleeve when it came to her family, but this level of it was ridiculous.</p>
<p>"I don't see anything," Amelia said as she eased in past Molly with her wand raised just in case they were attacked.</p>
<p>"There's some really dark bits attached to your wards," Lacey said with a ferocious scowl. She held her wand low but very much at the ready in a more European style of dueling than the standard British pose Amelia used.</p>
<p>Odd that there were new Black family members to meet now. That hadn't happened since well before Molly was born. Not adult members, anyway, and not ones that would acknowledge that Molly had Black blood and a thread of Black magic running right through her core.</p>
<p>Really, why Walburga always insisted that Molly was less of a Black for having been born a Prewitt and marrying Arthur, Molly would never know. Except for how she did know. Bigotry came easily to Walburga, along with stupidity.</p>
<p>Goodness, she was in such a mood. It was good that Arthur stayed behind with Ron. Molly would've been snapping his head right off.</p>
<p>"Molly?" Amelia asked.</p>
<p>"I apologize." Molly sighed. "I'm still a bit scatter-brained. Lacey, I'd greatly appreciate your help removing that. It will need Arthur or Bill, as well, but my workshop comes first. They never had access to it. No one but Dumbledore and I did."</p>
<p>The looks that Amelia and Lacey exchanged went from worried to dark and dangerous in an instant. Molly took a deep breath and led them across the living room, into the kitchen and then to the warded and invisible door that sat next to her pantry.</p>
<p>"I can't believe I put a potions lab directly next to my pantry!" Molly huffed, entirely at herself. "The possibility of cross-contamination alone should've made me rule that out."</p>
<p>"True," Lacey said, laughter in her voice despite the situation. "You're going to have to either give us access or open the door, Molly. I can't see it. I can't even feel it as anything other than an extra ward in the room."</p>
<p>"Agreed," Amelia said. There was no laughter at all in her voice, or her eyes when Molly turned to look. "The spells will take you again, you know."</p>
<p>Molly shuddered. "I know. They're designed to. I can remember my attitude, my attention, my very memory shifting depending on which side of the door I was on. He was… I don't know what he had me do but it's terrible and it has to be stopped. Stun me. Do whatever you have to if I get in the way. Just make sure that the potions in there are destroyed."</p>
<p>"I can cast a pretty good wardbuster through the door that'll blow the whole thing out the far wall," Lacey offered.</p>
<p>"We need to know what he had her doing," Amelia growled as if she wanted to stun Lacey.</p>
<p>"No," Molly said. She bit her lip. "No, that's not the most important thing. We need to destroy those potions. If we can learn what they are, that's lovely. I keep very detailed notes in a profoundly warded journal. It will survive anything short of Fiendfyre."</p>
<p>Amelia grumbled but finally nodded. "Fine. Let's get this done. The sooner we're finished here, the sooner we can track Dumbledore down."</p>
<p>"Or catch up on Harry and the kids," Lacey said with a shake of her head that felt like Molly's exhaustion every time the twins got into another scrape. "Merlin knows, they'll probably have that figured out by the time we get back."</p>
<p>Given what she'd heard about the Hogwarts library and the elves and the Founders' magical legacies that Harry'd freed, Molly could easily believe it. She nodded to Lacey and Amelia to be at the ready. Then she passed her main wand over to Amelia, her secondary wand to Lacey, and then put her hold-out wand into the sugar jar.</p>
<p>It never did work right when it was covered with sugar. That was the best she could do to keep the others safe.</p>
<p>Molly gripped the doorknob, feeling the wave of silver sliding back into her brain. It slipped right past all the shields and charms and spells that had been given to Molly, past all her defenses. There was a moment where she could feel pure rage, masculine rage…</p>
<p>"My word, when did you two get here?" Molly asked, utterly annoyed that she'd been interrupted before she could finish her latest batch of potions. "What can I do for you girls?"</p>
<p>The stunner aimed at Molly nearly hit her. She rolled to the left, reaching out to her wand in the sugar jar, summoning it wordlessly. Sugar sprayed everywhere. Molly flung a cutting curse towards the intruder who had to be polyjuiced to look like Amelia. Damn them, whoever they were, they weren't going to take Molly or her family.</p>
<p>The other intruder shot a wardbuster from a crouch. Molly threw up a shield, but it was too late because the wardbuster wasn't aimed at her. She screamed along with the silvery stream inside of her head that made it so hard to move and think and do anything but fuss over potions.</p>
<p>Molly grunted as her back hit the wall, her knee hit her nose hard enough to make Molly see stars, and her shield collapsed under the explosion of her workshop.</p>
<p>The Silver in her head fled as Molly collapsed to the floor, bleeding profusely from the nose and mouth. Consciousness fled with it.</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>The library was absolutely the most brilliant thing Harry had ever seen and that was saying something after everything that'd happened since he got his letter. It'd been pretty spectacular before, full of incredible books that reshelved themselves and spelled nooks where you could get an extra five or ten minutes of studying compared to everyone else if you were properly quiet and respectful.</p>
<p>Now it was enormous, easily as big as Hogwarts herself. The bookshelves seemed to extend for miles and miles. There were six stories of shelves along the wall, going up into torch-lit darkness, and what looked like at least four floors of bookshelves on floating platforms that you could walk up to by staring at the platform you wanted and starting to climb. The stairs would form under your feet, but if you lost your focus, they'd disappear, and you'd spiral down to the ground like a feather in the breeze.</p>
<p>Hermione and Dudley had found that one out by accident. Draco and Dudley had then spent a good half hour doing it deliberately, laughing like loons every time they drifted back down to the ground. All the first-year students were here, looking at the books, the library, or just sitting quietly and staring at everything in awe.</p>
<p>All the Ravenclaws were there, no matter what year, and all of them looked like they'd died and gone to heaven. Except for the ones who looked like they wanted to cry because the organization they'd memorized no longer held. Actually, when Harry stopped to watch, the Ravenclaws seemed to be alternating between delight and horror in the changes.</p>
<p>A few upper year students from the other houses were there, poking around and making shocked noises at the changes. Percy Weasley had stuck his head in and then scurried back to the infirmary to be with Ron and the rest of his family. That he'd come away to look at the library said a lot about just how much he wanted to be there despite Ron's condition.</p>
<p>Dudley and Draco landed next to Harry and Blaise, both of them laughing like fools as they ran back to try for a different platform. Hannah scowled at them before frowning like she intended to go to war and climbing the invisible stairs towards the top platform where Susan and Hermione were urgently chatting with Pansy about something.</p>
<p>"Seriously," Harry huffed to Blaise. "What is it with them?"</p>
<p>"At least they're having fun," Blaise said with a disinterested shrug. "Do we have any idea of how we're going to find stuff on Dumbledore, Grindelwald and Nurmengard?"</p>
<p>"Yep," Harry said. He grinned when Blaise stared at him with awe. "We're gonna ask Madame Pince for help. She's the one who knows the library and it knows her. The best thing for it is to ask and adult for help."</p>
<p>Blaise huffed and rolled his eyes. "And here I thought you'd have something cool to teach me."</p>
<p>"Eh, I don't. Maybe she will," Harry said</p>
<p>Harry blew out a breath as he finally found his way from the front door of the Library back to Madame Pince's office door. It wasn't anywhere near where it'd been when they'd left the library. Maybe it moved around now, like the stairs?</p>
<p>He knocked, flinching slightly as Madame Pince flung her door open.</p>
<p>"Oh, Mr. Potter," Madame Pince said much more gently that it looked like she'd been about to. "What can I do for our resident miracle worker?"</p>
<p>"You can work another miracle," Harry said, blushing and grinning at her. "Because I all I did was ask questions. You did all of this. But now I don't know how to find the books I need, especially since I know those books weren't in any sort of catalog or index or anything."</p>
<p>Madame Pince smiled at Harry, a smug, fond little smile that usually preceded adults attempting to smooth his hair. She didn't, thank goodness, try to make his hair behave. Instead she waved for the two of them to follow her towards the center of the study area near the main doors.</p>
<p>"The books are already cataloged, Mr. Potter," Madame Pince explained. "That was what my spell did, in combination with the Library itself and your magic making space for everything."</p>
<p>"I didn't do that!" Harry exclaimed because no. No, he hadn't. That'd happened all without him.</p>
<p>"I suppose I shouldn't say that it was you, personally," Madame Pince agreed. She nodded to Harry anyway. "It was more the magic that the Founders left in Hogwarts that adjusted space in the library to make room. The magic you're heir to as opposed to your personal or family magic."</p>
<p>"Oh." Harry blinked and then blushed when Blaise stared at him. "I mean, yeah, I noticed something going on, but I didn't really do anything? It was just… happening."</p>
<p>"Exactly," Madame Pince said. </p>
<p>She straightened like every single teacher did before they started the formal part of a new lesson. Every single student in the area, other than the Ravenclaws who were busy despairing of their organizational structures at that moment, focused on her.</p>
<p>"The Catalogia spell is a very useful and very powerful one," Madame Pince said. "It's used for organizing not just books in a library such as this, but also adding and removing entailed books to a Family Library. If you focus and use the correct gestures you can use the spell to organize your personal homework and other writings, which I will demonstrate and instruct those interested on later," her frown made the Ravenclaws subside. They'd looked about ready to mob Madame Pince.</p>
<p>"In addition," Madame Pince continued, "you should use Catalogia to ask the library to retrieve the books that will be most useful for your current research project. With an additional swirl of your wand and the proper focus, you can get tangential research targets to expand your essays to be more detailed, thorough or complete. And yes, I expect all of you to use it starting now. The Library is no longer damaged. It will return proper results instead of gibberish."</p>
<p>Harry turned to Blaise who had both of his eyebrows so high that they all but disappeared into his hair. "Hermione is going to scream that she missed this lecture."</p>
<p>"I'll be giving it repeatedly until I have everyone, Mr. Potter," Madame Pince said. "You simply get to go first."</p>
<p>He squeaked at that, and then huffed when Blaise gleefully shoved Harry right over next to Madame Pince. Learning a new spell with everyone watching was utterly nerve-wracking, but not too difficult. It was like the Library and the Gryffindor Magic wanted him to know it, so they sort of outlined it in his head as Madame Pince demonstrated the swish, twist and thrust over your head moves required by the spell.</p>
<p>Harry bit the tip of his tongue as he practiced the wand movements. Only after Madame Pince gave him a nod of approval did Harry focus on what he really wanted.</p>
<p>Which was information on Nurmengard. On Dumbledore and Grindelwald and what they were to each other. On where to find them. And, especially, on what they might be up to.</p>
<p>"I'm going to end up with so many books." Harry sighed as he stood in the spot, marked by an engraved box on the floor, where you were supposed to cast the spell. "Catalogia!"</p>
<p>He held the things he wanted clear in his head, especially the part about what Dumbledore was up to and how to defeat him, as the Catalogia spell swirled around him. It felt sixteen times more dramatic being inside of the spell than it was being outside of it. The Library shuddered.</p>
<p>Hogwarts seemed to shudder.</p>
<p>Then the floor rumbled near his feet and a set of stairs opened up leading downwards. Madame Pince gasped, both her hands flying to her mouth. Three books drifted out of the swirl of magic, landing gently right in front of Harry's feet.</p>
<p>"I don't think you were supposed to do it that hard, Harry," Dudley called from up on the second platform from the top. "I saw the trees in the Forbidden Forest shaking through the windows."</p>
<p>"I thought I was the one shaking," Harry said, horrified.</p>
<p>"Nope," Dudley said. He grinned and jumped off the platform to drift down next to Harry and his brand new set of stairs going who knew where. "Whatcha got? We gonna go black That Man's eye for Mum?"</p>
<p>Harry picked up his books. They were small, bound in soft doeskin in a natural tan, and barely half an inch thick. The first one said "Diary of Arianna Dumbledore". The second was "Grindelwald's Journal, Keep Out!". And the third had nothing whatsoever on the cover but it was bound with a silky cord that was neon lemon yellow braided with sparkly purple and an oily grey.</p>
<p>"I… think we'll need Aunt Petunia for these," Harry said. He looked down the stairs which were very dark but looked nice and sturdy. All stone with very little wear. "Um. Do you know where this goes, Madame Pince?"</p>
<p>"It's the entry to the Founders' Library," Madame Pince said from behind her hands. She was shaking as she stared down it. "Only the Founders' Heirs will be able to go down it, Mr. Potter. Only you and Susan."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, it's me, Pansy, Madame Bones and a guy who's in France," Harry said. He bit his lip. "I guess we should call him. I was really seriously focused on what we needed to stop Dumbledore. If this is the answer I got, then we'll probably need him."</p>
<p>"Mum?" Dudley asked.</p>
<p>Pansy drifted down with Susan and Hermione. "I swear, you get into the most ridiculous situations, Harry. I felt that all the way down to my toes."</p>
<p>"I sort of felt it," Susan said. "I think we need Aunt Amelia."</p>
<p>"Right," Harry said. "Back to see Aunt Petunia and make some floo calls. Hopefully one of the grownups will know what we need to do once we're down there because I sure don't."</p>
<p>Pansy winced when she looked down the stairs. She waved a hand and a door, wooden and carved into four quarters that were decorated with the House colors and seals, flew into place on top of the open stairwell. There was no handle. Maybe there didn't need to be if only four people could ever go in.</p>
<p>"Let's go," Pansy said. "The sooner we get this sorted out, the sooner things can go back to normal. We've got classes and tests and essays we should be writing. All of this running around isn't going to get us our OWLS or bring us success in life."</p>
<p>She marched off, leaving Harry and Dudley to scramble after her. Hermione stayed behind, already asking about the Catalogia spell along with about fifteen upper year Ravenclaws, six Hufflepuffs and all the rest of the first years who were on the main floor. Madame Pince was going to be teaching them that spell for hours and hours.</p>
<p>Which was fine. Harry had the books he needed and, maybe, more of an answer than he had before. Now he just had to figure out how to put it all together in a way that meant Dumbledore would go down and Harry and all his allies would survive intact.</p>

  <p>Amelia shuddered and rolled to her feet, wand in hand, before she had any clue what had happened. Her head throbbed abominably. Every single inch of her back felt like it was bruised. She could smell blood, but thankfully she didn't seem to be the one bleeding.</p>
<p>"Thank Merlin you're finally awake," Lacey snapped at Amelia. "Get up and help me stabilize the Burrow, woman!"</p>
<p>That got Amelia out of her defensive crouch and onto her feet. Damn it all, that was where she was. Molly. The Burrow. Whatever Dumbledore was up to. They'd come and the door had slapped more controls on Molly and now…</p>
<p>"Hellfire," Amelia complained as she started throwing stabilization spells over the hole blown out of the Burrow's kitchen wall.</p>
<p>Then over the rafters, the walls, most of the rest of kitchen and outwards from there because the place was on the verge of falling down on their heads. Lacey sighed like she'd just had a million tons taken off her shoulders. She shook her wand hand out and then cast the sort of wards that Amelia had taken down before but never seen put up.</p>
<p>Beautiful, elegant, highly efficient; Lacey's wards were gorgeous things that spun out like silver starlight with pearls, diamonds and water droplets. The longer she cast, the better the Burrow looked. The walls straightened. The floor above them solidified, the gaps between the boards closing. Then the doorway to Molly's workshop, shattered and broken, squared up until it almost looked like it was normal again.</p>
<p>"That's done it," Lacey said with a huge sigh of relief. "We can leave it be for Molly and Arthur to fix when they get back. How's Molly?"</p>
<p>"No idea," Amelia said. She stopped casting and turned to look around the room.</p>
<p>Molly lay crumbled on the floor opposite her workshop door, blood flowing freely from her nose and mouth.</p>
<p>"Hellfire," Amelia cursed as she hurried over to see whether or not Molly was dead, dying or had just broken her teeth by hitting the wall face-first.</p>
<p>It didn't take long to see what had happened. Knee to the face was one of those things that they trained you to avoid in the Aurors. Pity Molly hadn't had that training. She'd nailed herself solidly and broken her nose. The teeth were probably loose but that was easily fixed with a simple dental spell. Madame Pomfrey could handle it, no problem.</p>
<p>"Took a knee to the face but she'll survive," Amelia said as she used levicorpus to pick Molly up. "We have anything useful out of there?"</p>
<p>"Accio Molly's journals," Lacey said, wand at the ready in case something much worse had been spelled into the workshop to keep her secrets.</p>
<p>For once, things went their way. Amelia braced for another attack, another spell, something horrible but all that happened was three embroidered journals sailed out of the destroyed workshop and into Lacey's hand.</p>
<p>"Let's head back," Lacey said, shrinking the journals and putting them into her pocket. "I'd much rather Molly open these. They're sure to be spelled somehow and she's the only one who knows what the security measures are."</p>
<p>"Agreed," Amelia said. She laughed a bit ruefully. "I want to make sure that Susan hasn't gone and done anything stupid while we were gone."</p>
<p>"Oh, I doubt that it would be her," Lacey said with her own rueful little laugh. "Harry and Dudley are far more likely to be the ones doing stupid things than her. They're enthusiastic about trouble, so often. Such boys."</p>
<p>Amelia tried not to smile. She really did. She failed when Lacey rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>"There's a reason I was delighted that Susan is a girl," Amelia said. "They get into much less trouble at this age. I don't have as much to worry about until she's older. I'm not looking forward to the dating age, though."</p>
<p>"Oh, well, you've not got to worry about boys at that point," Lacey said with entirely too much confidence. "Susan's not going to be interested in them. I'd guess that she and Hannah are going to be a thing long before then, though. I saw that sort of bond forming several times at Beauxbatons."</p>
<p>She was entirely too serious about it as she led the way to the Burrow's fireplace and then offered a hand so that she could touch Molly and floo to Hogwarts with her. Amelia sighed and let her take care of Molly. Damn it all, she'd really hoped Susan would be reasonable and be a late bloomer. A very, very late bloomer. Just her luck that she didn't get that.</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>"Journals," Aunt Petunia said as she turned over the books that Harry had gotten from the Hogwarts libraries. "How mundane. I wouldn't have expected That Man to do something as simple as keep a journal."</p>
<p>Harry nodded. "What I want to know is who is Arianna Dumbledore? His mother? Sister? Daughter?"</p>
<p>"Arianna was Albus' younger sister," Professor McGonagall said in a faint, pale sort of voice that made Harry stare at her with worry. "She died very young. There was some… trouble when she was younger than you, Mr. Potter. Her magic was unreliable, uncontrollable. No one knows how she died."</p>
<p>"Trouble?" Harry asked.</p>
<p>Pretty much as soon as he asked, he could tell from Professor McGonagall's face just what sort of 'trouble' she meant. Grownups only got that sort of face when they talked about very young people getting molested. Or raped. Aunt Petunia seemed to see it instantly, too, because she frowned and took Arianna's journal out of Harry's hand.</p>
<p>She started flipping through the journal, an intense scowl on her face. The scowl went sad and then furious and then miserably sick. Aunt Petunia stopped reading, staring at one page. Professor McGonagall came over and read over Aunt Petunia's shoulder, but only for a moment. Then she shut her eyes and turned away, one hand over her mouth.</p>
<p>"Rape?" Harry asked Aunt Petunia because not knowing was worse than knowing.</p>
<p>"Mm," Aunt Petunia agreed, nodding once. Her lips were so thin that they practically disappeared entirely. "And then her family locked her away, refused to get her any treatment, and eventually she was only allowed to see her brothers and That Man's lover, Grindelwald."</p>
<p>"What?" Harry squawked. "But why? She didn't do anything! There was no reason to treat her that way."</p>
<p>He would've protested far more but the floo flared into life and Madame Bones came through with Lacey and a bloody-faced Mrs. Weasley. Thankfully for Harry's heart which had just about stopped at all the blood, Mrs. Weasley groaned as they came though, one hand going to her head. Professor McGonagall rushed over and cast several swift silent spells on Mrs. Weasley which made her sigh and subside though her eyes were open.</p>
<p>"What in Merlin's name happened?" Professor McGonagall asked, fussing over Mrs. Weasley.</p>
<p>"The spells on her workshop were a lot more robust than expected," Lacey said. She sighed and waved her wand to set Mrs. Weasley down on the floor. "I had to throw a wardbuster into her workshop to stop it from taking her over entirely."</p>
<p>"It blew up," Madame Bones agreed, helping Mrs. Weasley up and into one of the chairs in front of Dumbledore's desk. "Knocked both Molly and I into the wall. When she hit, her knee impacted her face. That's where the blood came from. She should be fine. Poppy can handle all of this easily."</p>
<p>"I seriously hope so," Professor McGonagall huffed. She did another spell and a silvery cat erupted from her wand. "Poppy, I need you in the Headmaster's office. Molly has some minor injuries which need treatment."</p>
<p>The cat zipped away through the  walls, leaving Harry and Dudley staring after it. Wow, another spell Harry wanted to learn. It looked super-useful if you could send messages to people like a quick phone call. Mrs. Weasley, thank goodness, was sitting up fine, lightly slapping at Professor McGonagall's hands like she didn't want anyone fussing over her.</p>
<p>"I'll be fine," Mrs. Weasley insisted though her words came out all mushy. "Tell me you have my journals."</p>
<p>"I do," Lacey said. She pulled out three shrunken journals, passing them over to Mrs. Weasley who huffed and then winced as if that little breath was too much for her face to handle. "Didn't check them yet. I wasn't sure what security you put on them."</p>
<p>Mrs. Weasley barked a very un-funny laugh. "Blood. You'd have been fine if you had my blood on your hands. This is the current one. Let's see…"</p>
<p>She started reading. Almost immediately, she started spluttering with outrage that made color rise on her cheeks to match the blood on her face. Almost like the color of her hair, actually. Harry bit his lip, turning to Aunt Petunia who was skimming through the journals he'd found in the library. She had just as grim, outraged an expression as Mrs. Weasley.</p>
<p>"He was working to create a 'better' world," Aunt Petunia said, glaring at one page like she wanted to set it on fire. "Which by That Man meant one wherein the Muggleborns were subject to control by the Purebloods and the Squibs were forbidden to interact with magic at all. All with him and his ever so perfect lover in charge."</p>
<p>"By whatever means necessary," Mrs. Weasley agreed. Her words still came out mushy but she seemed too angry to care if her face was bloody and her lips swollen and her nose seemed too flat. "He had me brewing various personality altering potions, several mind control potions and one, a recent addition, that could be used to outright enslave someone and tie their magic to yours. He insisted that it had to be done by Halloween though I've no idea why."</p>
<p>Dudley smacked his fist into his hand, glaring. "That's the day that Harry's parents were killed. I bet he was gonna do something to Harry that day, like, tie it back into what'd happened then and make a full loop of it all."</p>
<p>All the adults turned to stare at Dudley. So did Harry because wow, Dudley really had been paying attention to all the stuff he'd read with Harry. There were dozens of the old so-called Inaccurate books that claimed that you could do rituals that tied back into past events, drawing power from them or adding power to spells cast then to get new results.</p>
<p>Pansy and Susan stepped out of the corner where they'd been quietly waiting, out of Aunt Petunia and Professor McGonagall's direct path of outrage. Susan looked terrified. Pansy looked utterly furious, eyes sparking with green and silver magic that was so familiar. It was strange not to see it in his own magic anymore.</p>
<p>"Harry opened the way down into the Founders' Library, Madame Bones," Pansy said. "He thinks, and I agree, that we need all four of the Founders' heirs to head down into it."</p>
<p>"I was very focused on what I needed to defeat Dumbledore," Harry explained when Madame Bones frowned at first Pansy and then at Harry. "We got three journals, Dumbledore's, his sister Arianna's and Grindelwald's. Plus we got those stairs. So, maybe, the journals will tell us what he's after. And what we need is down in the Founders' Library. But I think we'll probably need the Ravenclaw heir, too. Nothing works against Dumbledore if you do it alone. You need allies to win, all the allies, working together."</p>
<p>Madame Bones nodded slowly. When Aunt Petunia offered Dumbledore's journal, Madame Bones took it. She skimmed through it, much like Aunt Petunia had. Harry bit his lip because she showed the same sort of responses. Anger, disgust, fury, despair, regret and then the sort of iron determination that made Harry stand straighter and Dudley stand like a bodyguard at Harry's side.</p>
<p>"We have to stop him," Mrs. Weasley said as Madame Pomfrey rushed up the stairs, white apron fluttering. "Immediately. This can't go on. We can't allow him to do this, Amelia! I won't let him use me this way!"</p>
<p>"You'll sit right there," Madame Pomfrey snapped at Molly, "and let me heal you before you go off on one of your rages, Molly. Don't make me stun you. You'd have a terrible headache for days afterwards if I did have to."</p>
<p>Mrs. Weasley settled back into her chair, grumbling under her breath as Madame Pomfrey worked. Madame Bones ignored both of them in favor of skimming through first Arianna's journal and then Grindelwald's. His made her go so pale that Harry took a step closer so that he could put his hand on her elbow.</p>
<p>"They were equals," Madame Bones whispered. Not to Harry. Not to Aunt Petunia or Dudley or even to Professor McGonagall who cupped Madame Bones' other elbow. "It was both of their idea. They came up with it all together. Dumbledore's great victory over Grindelwald was just part of their plan."</p>
<p>"No," Professor McGonagall gasped. She took the journal from Madame Bones, skimming through the last few pages of it. "Oh, damn them both to Hell! They've played us all for fools! That's it, I'm taking over as Acting Headmistress and seizing control of the wards. Lacey, help me with that. Amelia, you call the Ravenclaw Heir here. Tell him to get his butt here even if it requires an emergency international portkey. I want him here within the hour."</p>
<p>Aunt Petunia smiled. She took the journals away from Professor McGonagall and from Madame Bones. As Lacey hurried to follow Professor McGonagall off into the back room of Dumbledore’s, now her, office, Madame Bones went right to the floo. Harry would've gone her way, but Aunt Petunia put a hand on Harry's shoulder.</p>
<p>"Let them work, Harry," Aunt Petunia said. "I want both you and Pansy to get something to eat. Not too much candy. Plenty of good, solid food, please. They're both adults with their full magical resources. You're children. You'll need to be well fed and well rested before you do… whatever it is that you end up doing."</p>
<p>Harry nodded. "All right. Um, should we read the journals?"</p>
<p>Aunt Petunia shook her head very firmly, lips disappearing as she pressed them together again. "No. Definitely not. When you're an adult, certainly you can read them. I wouldn't want any child to read these. They're… even Arianna's is quite horrible. The poor child was so abused. They were aiming to turn her into some sort of weapon called an Obscural."</p>
<p>Madame Bones and Mrs. Weasley both stared at Aunt Petunia while Madame Pomfrey gasped and collapsed to her knees next to Mrs. Weasley. At least Mrs. Weasley looked a lot better, despite her horror. The swelling had gone down on her lips. Her nose didn't look flat anymore. And her eyes didn't look like they were both going to be black, either. That was magic Harry should learn. Heaven knew, Dudley got enough bloody noses and black eyes that it'd be very useful.</p>
<p>But first, he was going to do as ordered. He'd eat, try to relax, and then see if he could convince Kreacher to tell him what an Obscural was.</p>
<p>Then, with all the other Founders' Heirs, he'd stop Dumbledore's plot once and for all.</p>

  <p>Albus cursed under his breath as he paced the drab parlor in Nurmengard. Hidden away behind Gellert's 'jail cell', the parlor was a windowless stone square with only the sparest of furnishings to make it more comfortable. No banners, no colorful carpets, just a set of black leather covered couches, three grey leather covered armchairs and bookshelves filled with books.</p>
<p>He'd locked the wards down entirely after being driven out of Hogwarts. There had been no choice whatsoever about that. Albus couldn't keep control over Hogwarts and its so-important ley line nexus if the Founders' Heirs claimed their power. Especially if the Gryffindor Heir claimed his power, damn the boy. So many plans fallen to pieces and all because Harry bloody Potter refused to be the cowed, abused child he was supposed to be.</p>
<p>So now he was here, in Nurmengard a full four months ahead of when he should have been, with Gellert looking at him as if Albus had no reason to be in a strop.</p>
<p>No matter how many times Albus had offered to bring in something a bit more colorful, Gellert had refused. Scornfully, his lip curling up as if enjoying color was a personal failing of Albus'. The man might as well be colorblind. Albus certainly felt like he'd been struck colorblind every time he came to live here.</p>
<p>Their ruse of imprisoning Gellert had worked wonderfully over the decades. For six months, Albus would stay at Nurmengard, study in their hidden library, live quietly and comfortably behind Gellert's official jail cell while Gellert worked in the world under an unbreakable disguise charm. </p>
<p>At the end of the six months, Gellert would return to Nurmengard to rest, study and work on their plans to rule the world. They usually made the switch when the school year started as Gellert had little to no patience with very young children before they'd settled into the spells and charms and potions that made them so marvelously obedient. Albus early went to ensure that the next generation of British Magicals were properly conditioned for their future rulers.</p>
<p>It worked. Beautifully. They'd sculpted Magical Britain for generations, the world over the last twenty or so years since Albus was declared Supreme Mugwump. It was amazing how much one could do to change laws and spell people untraceably with that title.</p>
<p>Gone now, damn that boy.</p>
<p>"Do calm down," Gellert said from his sprawl on the couch. His hair was neatly combed and pulled back, his beard properly combed. "We've made plans for this."</p>
<p>"You don't understand," Albus snapped at him. "Our plans are nothing if everyone we've spelled is freed."</p>
<p>Decades of work. They'd lost decades of work in a matter of days and all because of that blasted Potter boy. He'd spent so much time and effort making sure that the boy's spirit was broken and that he was utterly isolated, all for nothing.</p>
<p>He'd known, all those years ago, that Trelawney's prophecy was a harbinger of doom. Not for that idiot puppet, Tom, but for Albus and Gellert and all their plans to save the world. She'd looked him right in the eyes, the silver mind control spells falling away to show the bright white shimmer of a true prophet's gift, and held his eyes as she pronounced his doom.</p>
<p>Harry Potter was his mortal enemy. </p>
<p>A baby. A mere child. It had seemed so impossible and yet, here he was, driven out of all of his positions of authority, chased right out of Hogwarts which they needed if they were to succeed.</p>
<p>Gellert sighed and stood, moving more like a hunting cat than like the old man he was. They both were old, damn it all. He'd gotten so close to creating the Elixir of Youth with the Philosopher's Stone. Just a few more months and he'd have been able to brew enough to return them to their primes. The last step they needed to take over the world, short the spells they'd been building on the ley line nexus under Hogwarts.</p>
<p>"Albus," Gellert said as he captured Albus' wrist.</p>
<p>"Let go," Albus snarled at him.</p>
<p>"Albus," Gellert repeated entirely too calmly, with too much of a smirk. "Breathe. Think. Stop reacting and use your brain. They cannot know what we have planned. So, we have to wait another few years. We will lie low, leave here and go to my other fortress in the Carpathians. This is not the end."</p>
<p>Albus jerked his wrist free, glowering at Gellert. "Don't be a fool, Gellert. You've forgotten how much care we have to have in public. I was chased away. Chased! I don't have our diaries. I don't have the Philosopher's Stone. I don't have anything other than Fawkes and he refuses to let me close. That little Goblin stole the Elder Wand! Every tool and every plan we have is now in their hands. They will figure it out."</p>
<p>Gellert rolled his eyes. "A child."</p>
<p>"A child with Lily Potter's elder sister guiding and teaching him," Albus countered. "I tried to break the boy's curiosity and will. I failed. He's gathered an army around him. It's not just students. Every adult he comes into contact with springs to his aid. It's uncanny. And they have Hogwarts, Gellert. Hogwarts!"</p>
<p>For the first time, Gellert looked uncomfortable. He frowned, turning away to gesture with his fingers as if he was writing on a parchment. A flick of his hand as if to wipe the parchment clean, and Gellert ran a different series of calculations in his head. That was dismissed more forcefully. A third and then a fourth followed and were dismissed just as quickly.</p>
<p>"We need to stop them," Gellert said finally, his eyes glittering as black and hard as they had when they were both young. "Immediately."</p>
<p>"Finally," Albus huffed. "I doubt that Fawkes will allow you close enough to him to transport us both."</p>
<p>Gellert smirked again as he caressed Albus' cheek in a way far more promising of private time in the dungeon than dealing with their enemies. Though they could certainly indulge afterwards, of course.</p>
<p>"I have several ways that we can get there unseen," Gellert said. "We'll need to get a replacement wand for you out of the stores. I'll want my wand back."</p>
<p>"Of course," Albus said.</p>
<p>Decades of practice had allowed them to use each others' wands interchangeably. There were many times where it was… helpful… to have an untraceable wand. Albus' image as a light mage had to be maintained, whether it was Gellert or Albus filling the colorful robes that Albus had chosen. Whoever went out into the world carried both the Elder Wand, damn Filius for a thief, and Gellert's wand hidden away.</p>
<p>Really, this was intolerable. Just a few more months, six or seven years at most, and they would have had everything in place. Both of them could have been out and about in the world instead of taking turns playing 'the Great Albus Dumbledore'.</p>
<p>They'd just have to take care of Potter and his allies quickly so that things could get back on track.</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>Gilles Fawley was a tall man with white hair and a scar on his chin. He frowned as Aunt Petunia explained everything that they'd figured out so far. Harry was more than happy to stay in the background even though he knew that the prophecy meant that he'd be shoved into the center of it all soon enough.</p>
<p>Aunt Petunia had her Very Serious Business face on. No way was Harry interrupting right now.</p>
<p>"You're sure about this?" Mr. Fawley said in faintly French-accented English. "Dumbledore is plotting to control people's minds?"</p>
<p>"Not just plotting," Madame Bones said with a scowl that seemed to be her version of Aunt Petunia's Someone's Getting In Trouble face. "He's done it. For generations, across Britain and potentially further."</p>
<p>Mr. Fawley shook his head, lips pursed and eyes troubled. "It's hard to believe. The Supreme Mugwump working against the betterment of Magical society."</p>
<p>"He always says things are for the Greater Good," Madame Bones said with a little sniff of disdain. "For all I know, that man actually does believe that mind-controlling the entire population of our world is working for our betterment."</p>
<p>Harry looked at Pansy who looked back at him. She frowned and huffed, crossing her arms over her chest. He had to agree. Having all your freedom, all your curiosity, everything good and happy taken away from you was definitely not serving any sort of Greater Good. Maybe it was better for Dumbledore, but it sure wasn't good for anyone else.</p>
<p>It was just the five of them. Aunt Petunia had sent everyone else away, even Dudley, to make sure that Hogwarts was properly warded, shielded, defended and armed in case Dumbledore came back and attacked. The Goblins had arrived just before Mr. Fawley showed up, following Professor Flitwick. They had dozens and dozens of armored warriors stationed in the dungeons. The aurors had put all sorts of people around the outer edges of the school property. Mr. Malfoy had come in with a whole bunch of wizards and witches who were blue eyed and blond haired with noses just the same shape as his. They were patrolling the Forbidden Forest for any signs of Dumbledore.</p>
<p>And the Elves were watching, too. Kreacher had marshalled all the Hogwarts elves, giving them tasks from keeping everyone fed to watching the grounds to talking to the basilisk who was much calmer and happier now that she had a nice full belly. There were, apparently, far fewer giant spiders in the Forbidden Forest than there had been.</p>
<p>The basilisk had told Itzy all sorts of ways that someone could get around Hogwarts through the walls, which is what she did when she went patrolling. Itzy was working to convince the basilisk that she should use her gaze to stun anyone who came, unless they were Dumbledore. He could die outright, turned to stone.</p>
<p>"Master Harry," Itzy said, popping in and making all of them other than Aunt Petunia and Pansy start. "Nice snakey basilisk said somethings that Itzy is concerned about. He asked the Hogwarts elves and they agree. Is very, very important."</p>
<p>"What is it?" Harry asked as he took Itzy's hands and pushed some magic to Itzy to clean. It worked beautifully to calm Itzy down so that he stopped shaking.</p>
<p>"There be two Dumbledores," Itzy said. He shook his head, ears flapping wildly when Madame Bones opened her mouth to argue. "Two! One is here for start of year and stays six months. Other comes after that and does summer things. We is not facing one Dumbledore. We is facing two. We gots to be ready for both of them."</p>
<p>Harry blew out a breath and nodded. "Thank you, Itzy. We'll make sure everyone knows. Actually, can you have the Elves tell everyone? They're way faster."</p>
<p>"Itzy will do," Itzy promised. "Master Harry bes careful. Master Ravenclaw and Madame Hufflepuff and scary little Mistress Slytherin bes careful, too."</p>
<p>Pansy perked up and preened. "I will be. You be careful, too."</p>
<p>When Itzy popped away, Pansy smirked at Harry. He grinned and laughed. She was a little scary, but it was like she was a much younger version of Aunt Petunia. Maybe when she was all grown up she'd be really scary.</p>
<p>Or maybe Harry's sense of proportion when it came to scary women was off.</p>
<p>That was very, very possible, actually. After all, he had Aunt Petunia and Madame Bones and Lacey and Professor McGonagall and Mrs. Weasley and Madame Longbottom around. All of them were really formidable, way more so than any of Aunt Petunia's bridge partners. Not that any of them could come close to Aunt Marge's sheer horribleness.</p>
<p>Either way, Mr. Fawley looked green as he rubbed a hand over his mouth. "Two Dumbledores? Who could the other be?"</p>
<p>"Who else could it be?" Madame Bones said. She glowered out the window of Dumbledore's office. "It has to be Grindelwald. The Elves said that he'd pretended to do great things a long time ago. That must be what they meant. Grindelwald hasn't been sealed away at all. He's been free to walk among us, to spell people and control them, for generations."</p>
<p>"And they've been working to create an Obscural that they could control ever since Arianna," Aunt Petunia said. "A magical assassin that no one could track. Monster."</p>
<p>"…Oh." Harry's stomach turned over so hard that he had to clap a hand over his mouth. Aunt Petunia was just there in front of him, her hands on her shoulders as she knelt to stare into his eyes.</p>
<p>"What is it, Harry?" Aunt Petunia asked.</p>
<p>"You said that Obscurals were created from abused kids," Harry said slowly, around the queasy churning of his stomach. "So there was Arianna, their first attempt, but she died somehow in an argument. And then there was Tom Riddle. He didn't become an Obscural. He just went crazy and tried to take over the world. And then… there's me. That's what he wanted to do to me. An Obscural that he could control, one with the Potter magic and the Black magic and the Gryffindor magic and even the Slytherin magic. All of that power, all ready to attack at Dumbledore's order. That must be what he was doing when he cursed us."</p>
<p>Aunt Petunia pulled him into a hug that made his bones creak. She was cursing under her breath, as angry as he'd ever seen her. Ever felt her. For the very first time, Harry could feel her magic moving on her skin. Moving in her voice, really, because it rose and fell in time with every word Aunt Petunia said and how she said it.</p>
<p>"There must be more to it," Pansy said once Aunt Petunia let him go. "I mean, seriously? That's horrible and I believe it. I do. But… that doesn't explain the whole thing about controlling everyone's minds. It doesn't explain why he had so many jobs. Headmaster of Hogwarts plus the Wizengamot thing plus Supreme Mugwump. If all they, he, no they, wanted was an untraceable assassin, that wouldn't require everything else."</p>
<p>"No, it wouldn't," Mr. Fawley said slowly. He hummed while rubbing his hands together like they were cold, massaging his knuckles as he thought. "But the one he took first, the one he was most dedicated to, was Headmaster. Everything else came later."</p>
<p>Madame Bones nodded. "Right. Let's get moving. We need to get down into the Founder's Library. The sooner we see what he was up to, the sooner we can block him. Or stop him outright."</p>
<p>"Them," Harry corrected. He stared back into her eyes when Madame Bones frowned at him. "I believe Itzy and the Elves and the basilisk. It's not just Dumbledore. There're two evil wizards we have to fight. We can't forget that or we'll get blindsided by a rush and get taken down."</p>
<p>None of them got the reference other than Aunt Petunia who snorted a little laugh that Harry would bring rugby terminology into things. But it was accurate enough. They had to watch out or they'd be surprised and then it would all be over.</p>
<p>Harry didn't think for a minute that he was a match for Dumbledore.</p>
<p>He sure wasn't a match for two Dumbledores, especially if they weren't pretending to be Leaders of the Light anymore.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Albus snarled as he shot a series of hexes up the dungeon hallway towards Severus. Traitorous wretch. After Albus had kept him out of prison and given him a job, he turned on Albus. That first attack had nearly taken Albus' head off outright. If Gellert hadn't been aware, primed for a fight, Albus would already be dead.</p>
<p>More than likely temporarily given all the work they'd done to extend their lives, but it would still have been quite inconvenient. Might have delayed them enough that that whelp Potter managed to figure something out.</p>
<p>Severus' blood decorated the wall of the dungeon nicely. After this was over, Albus would give him to Gellert. There would be no treachery from Severus after that. Gellert always had had a dab hand at training people to obey.</p>
<p>After this was over.</p>
<p>They still had two turns to make it to the proper passage. They had to get to a particular spot if they wanted to get into the Founder's Library where everything rested. It had taken so long, years of dedicated effort and far too much work, to create the secret entrance. Only they could use it. Not even Potter could open it, no matter what magical legacy he claimed.</p>
<p>"The wards are not happy, Albus," Gellert murmured.</p>
<p>He twisted his wand and shot a fireball up the passage. The screams from Severus and his useless Slytherin seventh years and pounding feet made both of them smile.</p>
<p>"I'm quite aware of it," Albus agreed. "Giving me a bit of a headache. We'll fix it once we're there."</p>
<p>"We'll have to," Gellert said. He grimaced. "She's trying to force us out. That's never happened before."</p>
<p>"Minerva must have claimed the Headmistress position," Albus said with a frustrated sigh as the sound of Severus and his students creeping back hit his ears. "Damn that traitor. I thought I had him broken."</p>
<p>"I thought I had him broken," Gellert agreed. "Pity. We may need to eliminate him. He was useful, but if he won't obey, won't even pretend, he's worthless."</p>
<p>They both cursed a blue streak as a band of seventh year Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs ran in from the opposite end of the hallway. They must have snuck in through the kitchens, taking the damnable House Elves' passages to get there. It was the only way to reach that particular end of the hallway without passing Albus and Gellert.</p>
<p>No teacher. No adult. Albus smiled.</p>
<p>He hit them all with the mind numbing spell, the one that worked so beautifully to prepare children for being control charmed. The leaders, a pair of Gryffindor boys bracketing a burly Hufflepuff girl, stumbled. The girl snarled, shook her head and then slapped both of them upside the head. They staggered, shook their heads and then began shooting hexes at Albus.</p>
<p>Shields slapped into place just in time. Albus kept firing spells at them, trusting Gellert to keep him safe. They were stronger together than apart. Gellert wouldn't betray him. Yet. Possibly not ever, but that remained to be seen. They'd not yet claimed the world, after all. It might prove to be the temptation that pushed them too far.</p>
<p>Mind control charms of all varieties slid off the children. Albus huffed and started shooting cutting curses, hexes and a few firework charms at them. Fireworks in an enclosed hallway made for a beautiful distraction. Also some lovely burns if you didn't get out of their way fast enough or shield hard enough.</p>
<p>"They're closing in," Gellert said through gritted teeth.</p>
<p>They were.</p>
<p>"Sewers," Albus decided. "It's faster, anyway. She should still be trapped in the Chamber."</p>
<p>Gellert grunted as one of the Slytherins hit his shields with a stunner so strong it nearly knocked Gellert over. "At this point, I won't believe anything will go right. Get it open. I'm going to take care of these brats once and for all."</p>
<p>Fiendfyre. </p>
<p>Albus raised an eyebrow and then shook his head. Ah well. It had been too much to expect that Gellert would keep his temper under control in a battle. Albus fired off a series of flashing explosions that set off shouts of dismay in their attackers. Blinding them to opening the sewer entrance a few feet away was a benefit, certainly, but the real purpose was to blind them to Gellert's spell.</p>
<p>"No!" Severus bellowed. "Run, you fools! It's Fiendfyre!"</p>
<p>Ah well. Pity that Severus knew the spell so well. Gellert wouldn't catch half as many of the whelps as he would have otherwise. Albus waited until the fire had grown so hot and so wide that it was roaring up the passageway in both directions before he grabbed the back of Gellert's robes and hauled him into the sewer.</p>
<p>They shut the door together, shielding the entrance with everything they had so that the Fiendfyre wouldn't get in.</p>
<p>It worked. Of course. Gellert was a grandmaster of that particular spell.</p>
<p>Albus laughed as Gellert claimed a quick, hard kiss. "Later. The dungeons will still be there."</p>
<p>"Mm, I'll hold you to that." Gellert nodded up the passage. "It's roundabout but it should get us there. I directed it upwards and outwards, not deeper into the dungeons."</p>
<p>They both knew the sewers like the backs of their hands. How could they not? They'd spent decades exploring, spelling and controlling Hogwarts until she did what they wanted, when they wanted. How irritating that she was fighting against them now.</p>
<p>"So much work we'll have to redo," Albus grumbled as they turned right, then left, right and another right. "She's fighting us horrifically."</p>
<p>Gellert put a hand on Albus' shoulder. "Do you hear that?"</p>
<p>It took a moment. Albus' mouth dropped open as he heard the slither of scales against the cool stone tunnels. He couldn't have. Potter couldn't have freed the basilisk.</p>
<p>"How is he doing this?" Albus hissed as both he and Gellert cast protective mirror spells over their faces. "He's a first year. He was isolated from everything magical. I cursed those Muggles until they should have been abusing him half to death."</p>
<p>"Something clearly went wrong with that part of the plan," Gellert said. He shoved Albus ahead of him. "She's free and she's angry. Run!"</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>Harry delicately ran his fingertips over the rough stone wall as he followed Madame Bones down the stairs into the Founders' Library. It was a sort of blueish gray stone, weathered and rough like it had barely been hewn at all before it was mortared into the wall. To Harry's magic, the Gryffindor part, it felt like home. Like a chunk of his heart that he'd never known was there before.</p>
<p>"This feels so right," Pansy whispered behind him. "Why does it feel so right?"</p>
<p>"Because we're the Founders' Heirs," Mr. Fawley said behind Pansy. His wand was held high, the tip lit with a silent lumos that Harry desperately wanted to learn to do, too. "We belong here. Hogwarts wants us here. To do something."</p>
<p>"I just wish I knew what." Madame Bones growled. "Bottom of the stairs. Let's see what we've got."</p>
<p>She stepped into a room that sounded small. Her heels barely echoed as she slowly strode out into the dark space. It didn't stay dark for long. Crystals the size of Harry's head set into torch holders began to glow as soon as Harry, Pansy and Mr. Fawley reached the bottom of the stairs.</p>
<p>It wasn't a small room.</p>
<p>It was oval, about the size and shape of a small auditorium with terraces that took four steps down into a central area that had a huge table, a pool and several metal things that Harry didn't recognize. The bookshelves were filled with heavy leather-bound books all around the outer rim of the room. The second smaller terrace had books bound in fabric of all colors and types. The third smaller still terrace held racks full of scrolls carefully wrapped in silk with lovely ribbons that said what they were. The final terrace had a half-height set of bookshelves that were full of artifacts.</p>
<p>Gold and silver, stone and wood, wire wrapped around bone; the artifacts were weird and wonderful and scary all at once.</p>
<p>"That's… the Philosopher's stone," Mr. Fawley whispered. He pointed towards a small platinum cauldron with a milky-white stone suspended over it in a cage of gold wire. "They're making youth serum."</p>
<p>"Or something worse," Madame Bones whispered in a horrified voice that made Harry reach out for Pansy's hand.</p>
<p>He sort of expected Pansy to bat his hand away, but she gripped his hand hard enough to make him wince. Harry didn't tell her to stop. He just slowly approached the table and the pool set in the floor.</p>
<p>Harry really didn't want to be close to those wire things.</p>
<p>They smelled like blood. Like old dead things. The rust on them might not actually be rust. It looked way too much like dried blood. Harry had seen that often enough before the curses were broken. All Dudley's beatings had taught Harry exactly what blood and pain and death were.</p>
<p>"That's Dark," Pansy whispered.</p>
<p>"It is," Mr. Fawley agreed. "Don't touch it, children."</p>
<p>"We need to know what it does," Harry protested even though he didn't want to touch the thing at all. Any of the ugly, nasty metal things with their dried blood and bundles of herbs that might actually be bones wrapped with dirty rags.</p>
<p>Madame Bones nodded grimly. She was the one to approach the wire things. Her cursing rose and fell like the waves washing up against the shore. Mr. Fawley set to work examining all the artifacts on the table, which made him curse in French, before he started cautiously poking at the cauldron with the Philosopher's stone.</p>
<p>"What's the pool do?" Pansy whispered to Harry.</p>
<p>"Dunno," Harry replied, jerking his head towards it.</p>
<p>Pansy nodded, lips pressed together and hand grinding Harry's bones until they might just break.</p>
<p>They edged their way around the pool, looking for anything that might be a trap. Nothing seemed to be. His magic didn't yell at Harry. It did tug at him, pulling him past the pool and up the other side of the terraces. Pansy frowned at Harry, but she followed along with him.</p>
<p>"Don't leave the room," Madame Bones snapped as Harry started patting the wall.</p>
<p>"There's… something else," Harry said. "I don't know what it is, but there's something else here. Right here. It's important. Can't you feel it? What we need is in here!"</p>
<p>"…It is," Pansy agreed. "Come on. Get away from those nasty things and come see. What we need is here. Hogwarts is all but yelling it when you get out of range of those things."</p>
<p>Mr. Fawley raised an eyebrow. He braced himself and then shot a silent spell at the cauldron under the Philosopher's Stone. Whatever the potion was in it, it went up in a puff of rainbow-colored smoke. The Stone teetered inside of its wire cage. Mr. Fawley pulled it out and pocketed it with a firm nod.</p>
<p>"Good idea," Madame Bones said. "Go on up there. I can't leave these things here intact."</p>
<p>Whatever her spell was, it was fast and hard and loud and made the wire things crack loudly before they started to melt into a noxious blackened heap on the floor. Madame Bones levitated them together and then hit them again. By the time she was done with her third spell, they'd been transformed into melted, fused hunks of metal that smoked slightly.</p>
<p>"Thorough," was all Mr. Fawley said.</p>
<p>"It is… You're right," Madame Bones said once she joined them at the back wall. "There's something here. But how do we open it?"</p>
<p>Harry thought about it and shrugged. Asking had worked almost every time before. It might work this time, too.</p>
<p>"Hogwarts, we hear you," Harry said with his hands pressed against the wall. "Can you please let us in? We want to fix it as quickly as we can."</p>
<p>The room was silent long enough for Mr. Fawley to sigh as if Harry was being silly and Pansy to cock her head to the side as she raised an eyebrow at Harry. Thankfully, Madame Bones just watched the door.</p>
<p>When she put her hand on the wall above Harry's, a crack appeared.</p>
<p>Pansy gasped and smacked her hands onto the wall right next to Harry's. The crack widened, glowing as it went up and down and then turned corners until it was the outline of a door.</p>
<p>"I should have thought of that," Mr. Fawley said. He put his hand next to Madame Bones and pushed.</p>
<p>The door opened inwards, silent and smooth.</p>
<p>Inside was a small room, almost a closet. The walls were smoother, worked until they gleamed like marble despite being made of that grey-blue stone. Two chairs sat at a very modern worktable. There was a perch, a book, a mirror and Fawkes, sitting on the perch while crooning a very, very sad song to himself.</p>
<p>"Fawkes!" Harry gasped and ran in to him. "Oh, thank goodness you're all right! I was so worried about you."</p>
<p>He ignored the way Pansy laughed and Madame Bones choked. Even Mr. Fawley's incredulous question in French didn't matter as much as Fawkes and the delicate golden chains on his ankles.</p>
<p>Dumbledore had enslaved a phoenix.</p>
<p>"We'll get them off, I promise," Harry told Fawkes. "We just need to figure out what Dumbledore and Grindelwald are up to so that we can stop it."</p>
<p>Fawkes stared at Harry and then leaned his forehead against Harry's.</p>
<p>Images filled Harry's mind. A spell, sweeping outwards from Hogwarts along lines in the earth. Everyone it touched was affected and it touched absolutely everyone, everywhere. The Magicals' eyes went silvery and they all started walking in perfect unison. The Squibs screamed and screamed, clawing at their faces and eyes and throats. They fell to the ground to kick and scream until foam came from their mouths. Then they didn't move anymore.</p>
<p>The Muggles… died.</p>
<p>They just fell over, life lifted right out of them by the spell that would cleanse the world of everything but the Magicals that Dumbledore and Grindelwald thought were worthwhile. Only a million or so Magicals would be left, every single one of them controlled.</p>
<p>Then Fawkes' magic swept out along with the spell, burning everything non-magical away. The bodies of the dead, the living but insane Squibs, every building and car and plane that Muggles had built was sent up in flames so fierce that they were consumed utterly. Ash drifted to the ground in blankets in places. Thinly in other places.</p>
<p>Fawkes let Harry go.</p>
<p>He staggered backwards and fell on his bum. Pansy was crying, her hands over her mouth. Madame Bones was as white as a ghost while Mr. Fawley heaved great breaths in and out like he was trying not to throw up.</p>
<p>"No," Harry said as he dragged himself back to his feet, back to Fawkes. "No. I won't let them. I won't let them do this, Fawkes! Not to anyone but especially not to you!"</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Albus had always been a fuzzy-headed nincompoop when it came to students of Hogwarts. He would, endlessly and eternally, believe that none of the little wretches could possibly be a threat. Not to the Great Albus Dumbledore, whichever of them was filling those God-awful robes at the time.</p>
<p>Idiot.</p>
<p>Gellert understood very well just how dangerous all of the students were. The teachers, as well. They were vicious, unpredictable animals who would turn on each other or on their teachers in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>Some of them were worse than others. The Potters had been a thorn in their side since they hatched the Great Plan. Albus must have forgotten just how impossible the Potters were in the lull between James' death and Harry Potter's return to the magical world. And those Evans sisters! Gellert had warned Albus that they should both be executed with extreme prejudice, but no. They might be useful.</p>
<p>Useful. </p>
<p>Wooly thinking at its worst.</p>
<p>"The sewers are sealed again," Albus said, panting as he leaned against the doorway they'd finally managed to get through. Nearly at the Founder's Library at last. "She won't get out this time."</p>
<p>"Not until the Elves let her out," Gellert snapped at Albus. "Get your shields up, you fool. The entire Malfoy clan his here to kill us.</p>
<p>Albus' jaw dropped open. "What?"</p>
<p>"That Potter brat apparently saved Lucius from the control spells," Gellert said. "The Dark Mark is gone. Entirely. Lucius has brought in every single Malfoy there is."</p>
<p>The battle against the basilisk had taken them through nearly all the sewers before they'd managed to get her back into a tight spot and then seal her in. During the run for the door and safety, Gellert had cast his best scrying spells. The little bits of enchanted paper had flown ahead of them, fastening themselves to the walls, floors and stairs of Hogwarts. Then their spells had activated, letting Gellert see what they saw, hear what they heard.</p>
<p>He hadn't managed to get them everywhere. It wasn't necessary. He'd seen enough. That brat Draco Malfoy explaining the situation to his father and mother, a small army of blond, blue-eyed Malfoys in their genteel finest battle leathers.</p>
<p>Albus cursed and strode towards the door to the Founder's Library.</p>
<p>A torch lifted off the wall and swung at his head.</p>
<p>Gellert shielded Albus, grabbed the back of his robes and dragged him back before the Elves at the end of the hallway could try again.</p>
<p>"And he's managed to suborn the Elves," Gellert continued. "They're bonded to him now. And much stronger than the nasty little things should be."</p>
<p>"I'm going to cut the boy's throat myself," Albus said in the too calm, too controlled voice that meant his temper was just about shot.</p>
<p>"I'll hold him down," Gellert promised. "We have two minutes, at most, to take down the Elves before the Malfoys get here."</p>
<p>Albus nodded slowly. "Brace yourself."</p>
<p>Even without the Elder Wands, Albus was a terrifying dueler. When he let go, which he rarely did with anyone but Gellert, he was vicious, fast, and bloodthirsty in ways that would give the lie to his so-called "Leader of the Light" reputation.</p>
<p>Six Elves died before they could blink. The rest howled with rage and began tearing up flooring tiles to fling at them like cannonballs. Gellert blocked those, shattering them as necessary but mostly just stealing them so that shortly they had a lovely supply of free stones.</p>
<p>When Albus stunned all the Elves in the passageway, Gellert grunted. Truly, there was no one in the world who was a match for him other than Albus. That they'd managed to fool the world for so many decades as to their true relationship still amazed him.</p>
<p>"Here they come!" Gellert said as Lucius and Narcissa eased down the final staircase and headed towards them.</p>
<p>Thirty Malfoys came behind them, all with their wands at the ready. All of them between Gellert, Albus and their entrance to the Founder's Library. Well, that couldn't be allowed to continue.</p>
<p>Gellert waited until they were all in the Dungeon. Then he activated the other spell on the scrying strips. Electricity arced through the passageways, connecting with and making all the Malfoys jerk like marionettes during an earthquake. He held the connection until the strips burned out.</p>
<p>All the Malfoy's collapsed to the ground, unconscious.</p>
<p>"Elegant as always," Albus commented. </p>
<p>His smile was back, the black, vicious one that required using glamours on an ongoing basis. Gellert laughed. Albus' eyes went wide as he stared over Gellert's shoulder.</p>
<p>The shields went up instinctively.</p>
<p>Gellert didn't even hear whatever it was Madame Longbottom shouted at them. His heartbeat was too loud in his ears as he fought against the cutting curse attempting to saw its way straight through the strongest shields that Gellert had. Albus levitated a rock into the way of the cutting curse and then pulled Gellert down.</p>
<p>The rock shattered. The remains of the cutting curse gouged a groove into the wall exactly at Gellert's neck height. Madame Longbottom snarled.</p>
<p>Behind her, the misfit Blacks Anthony and Lacey had their wands at the ready. Remus was with them, eyes glowing gold and fangs obvious in his mouth. His claws were out from sheer rage.</p>
<p>"Oh, that's not good," Gellert commented to Albus.</p>
<p>"No, I imagine it's not."</p>
<p>Albus stayed focused on Madame Longbottom's party as Gellert whirled back to the passed-out Malfoy clan.</p>
<p>They were all gone, whisked away up the stairs to be revived. Damn it all. He knew better than to leave an enemy alive behind him. They should have killed the lot as soon as they fell. At least with those injuries it wouldn't be a quick return to the battle.</p>
<p>Which was going to be utterly vicious.</p>
<p>Sirius Black stood in Lucius Malfoy's place. One arm was in a sling, but it wasn't his dominant wand hand. The tip of Sirius' wand already glowed.</p>
<p>"Always nice to see that my godson is as brilliant as his parents," Sirius said far too lightly. "Pity that he's not here to hear the praise, but that's probably for the best. This isn't something for children to see."</p>
<p>More Blacks emerged behind Sirius. Not Bellatrix. She, thankfully, should still be locked away in Azkaban. Hopefully she'd die there. The little bint was too insane to be useful and had been since she was a teen. He'd pushed her… a little too hard in her first year at Hogwarts. Still hadn't turned her into the Obscural their plans needed, sadly.</p>
<p>"You're not going to survive this, boy," Gellert told Sirius.</p>
<p>"Funny," Sirius said with a grim smile that could have come from his grandfather Arcturus on the dueling platform. "I was just going to say that to you. Both of you."</p>
<p>"Damn it, they've brought the entire Longbottom Clan!" Albus hissed to Gellert.</p>
<p>"You'd best have your worst manners on then," Gellert said.</p>
<p>"Just like old times," Albus said.</p>
<p>He laughed, as wild and terrifying as when they were teens together. Gellert grinned and then laughed, too. Oh, these whelps. They had no idea what the two of them could do. Especially here in Hogwarts. She might be fighting them, but it wouldn't matter. They'd embedded too many things in her walls for this battle to go any way but in their favor.</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>Harry huffed as he tried to work the chains off of Fawkes' ankles. They weren't budging. Not at all.</p>
<p>Fawkes trilled a soft note. It felt like him saying 'don't bother' and 'you can't free me'.</p>
<p>"I might not be able to," Harry said, glaring at those horrible chains, "but together I bet we can."</p>
<p>"This room is the key," Pansy said from the table where she'd been studying notes and things that Dumbledore had left behind. "The other room is important because it had all sorts of stuff that they used to be more powerful, but this room, right here, is the key to what they're doing. The pool out there is for scrying. Apparently, this room is right at the heart of the node of ley lines that supports Hogwarts' magic."</p>
<p>The table was made of stone that came right up out of the floor. It looked like it'd been carved out of the bedrock, or like the room had been carved around the table. Maybe it was a table? It kind of looked like an altar, too, but Harry really didn't want to think that.</p>
<p>Dumbledore and Grindelwald had done horrible things here. If it was an altar instead of a table, that was a thousand times worse. So it was a table. A table covered with runes and spell circles, one that glowed very, very slightly if you looked at it from the corner of your eye.</p>
<p>Definitely not an altar. Nope. Harry wasn't going to believe it was a defiled sacred space.</p>
<p>Until maybe after it was all over and he could go cry in Aunt Petunia's arms.</p>
<p>Mr. Fawley hissed as he read over Pansy's shoulder. "Damn them. The spells are already here. They're embedded into Hogwarts' walls. Into her foundation. All the way up to the rafters."</p>
<p>"Can we break them?" Harry asked.</p>
<p>"Not without breaking Hogwarts," Mr. Fawley said. He rubbed a hand over his mouth. "If I'm right about the math here, we might just send a wave of destruction through the ley lines that would break every magical enclave on the planet if we tried it."</p>
<p>Fawkes squawked at that. So did Harry.</p>
<p>"We're definitely not doing that," Madame Bones said. "We've got to block it somehow."</p>
<p>"That's not going to work," Pansy said. She slapped the table with both hands, so furious that her scowl twisted her face up almost as much as a goblin's. "That would mean blocking the ley lines and none of us have the power to do that."</p>
<p>Harry bit his lip. Not good. Very not good.</p>
<p>It was a bit like when Dudley used to go Harry Hunting. Can't go this way. Can't go that way. If he went up, he'd hit a block or the teachers who'd get him in trouble. If he went down, he'd be caught.</p>
<p>"Okay," Harry said as he came over to the table, "if we can't break it or block it, can we use it?"</p>
<p>All three of them stared at Harry like he'd just lost his mind. Fawkes flamed over to stare at Harry quizzically.</p>
<p>"Well, I mean, the spell's there," Harry explained more to Fawkes than to the others. "Is it like an artifact, something that can be used over and over? I didn't think it was when you showed it to me. It was more a one-and-done sort of thing. So, I mean, can we use it to do something else? That way it's done and they're not going to get a chance to do anything else with it."</p>
<p>He sort of felt like they were still linked, still sharing thoughts on a deep level. There was a brightness to his magic and his mind that was different than it had been before. Fawkes crooned at the thought, the brightness in Harry's mind increasing as Fawkes perked right up.</p>
<p>"Maybe healing or something?" Pansy suggested.</p>
<p>"Breaking the control spells on everyone would be perfect," Madame Bones countered.</p>
<p>"That," Mr. Fawley agreed with a finger wagged in her direction. "We'd best hurry, though. I feel like we… don't have much time."</p>
<p>Harry frowned before going to put his hands on the wall. As soon as he touched Hogwarts, she filled him with a huge sense of urgency. They really didn't have much time. Dumbledore and Grindelwald were both here, battling everyone else. He shuddered.</p>
<p>"They're sacrificing themselves to give us time," Harry whispered. He whirled back to Madame Bones and Mr. Fawley, utterly terrified for everyone he'd saved and made friends with and helped. "They'll die if we don't stop them! We gotta do something!"</p>
<p>Pansy nodded even though she was very, very pale. "I like the idea of using the spell to break the controls. That way the rest of Britain and the world won't be under their control. They'll be able to come after Dumbledore and Grindelwald until they're taken down."</p>
<p>"That's what we'll do then," Madame Bones said. "What's the method?"</p>
<p>There didn't seem to be a method in the notes. Harry helped the others search for it, his heart pounding with fear and worry for his friends, until Fawkes hopped over and put one foot on Harry's wrist.</p>
<p>He froze.</p>
<p>"It's you," Harry said. "You're the key that turns the lock. You're the trigger for the spell."</p>
<p>Fawkes crooned a low, sad, miserable note and nodded.</p>
<p>And then squawked in surprise when Harry pulled him close and gently hugged him. He was warm, so very warm. His magic felt a lot like the Gryffindor magic. Like… maybe? They belonged together?</p>
<p>He'd have to do some research later. After this was over. Harry let Fawkes go, biting his lip at the glimmer of tears in Fawkes' eyes. There would be an after. He wouldn't let anyone die, not anymore.</p>
<p>"Let's do this," Harry said to Fawkes and the others.</p>
<p>Fawkes directed them to the proper positions. Pansy had the southernmost spot on the table. Mr. Fawley had east. Madame Bones took west. And Harry took North, right next to Fawkes who clucked and nodded.</p>
<p>"You're the one who knows how to break the spells, Potter," Madame Bones said. She didn't look very happy about it. "You'll have to take the lead."</p>
<p>"It's… not complicated," Harry said with a little shrug. "I just throw power at them, all the while grimly determined not to stop until they break. No matter what it costs me. If all of us work together, if we all pour our magic into it, it should work. Especially here, in Hogwarts, in the Founders' Library. There's so much power here. If we pull it all in, focus it on freeing everyone," he caressed Fawkes' cheek, "it should work."</p>
<p>Fawkes nodded thoughtfully. He held up one foot, the fine golden chains on them glimmering. Harry touched one again, this time with his magic instead of just his fingers.</p>
<p>"Oh, the spells are all linked to the chains," Harry breathed. "That's brilliant! Now I have something to focus on. Okay, you guys pull on your power and I'll use my magic like a wedge. We'll throw it all into the spell they were building and then shape it to hammer away at the control spells so that everyone can be free."</p>
<p>Harry just hoped that it would be that simple.</p>
<p>Hogwarts wanted to do it. Fawkes wanted to. The ley lines were just channels of power, like powerlines overhead. They'd do whatever was sent along them. Hopefully the four of them could twist Dumbledore's spell into doing something good.</p>
<p>Before Dumbledore and Grindelwald got there.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>Gellert's strangled scream of pain was nearly enough to turn Albus around. There was no thud of Gellert falling. Albus kept his eyes on Minerva and Filius, who didn't have the Elder Wand, damn him. If he could just get the Elder Wand back, it would be enough of an advantage to set all these idiots right.</p>
<p>So many control spells that would need to be redone. At least Molly's workshop should be intact. They'd spelled that room every which way to ensure that no one, especially Molly, could enter it without being firmly spelled to obey their orders.</p>
<p>Not that it did them much good right now.</p>
<p>The battle had gone bloody within moments of Sirius' arrival with the Blacks. For all the work Albus had done to twist Sirius in a new direction, and all the work Gellert had done to ensure that Sirius rejected the Black training he'd gotten as a boy, Sirius fought like a Black. He fought like Bellatrix before she went insane, damn the man.</p>
<p>"My arm…" Gellert panted behind Albus.</p>
<p>"Gone?"</p>
<p>"Broken," Gellert corrected. "Not my wand arm. Bleeding badly though."</p>
<p>Albus cursed and let loose a whole series of explosive fireworks that curled Minerva's lip until they went off, knocking everyone on that end of the passageway on their arses. Filius rolled to his feet immediately, but there was blood coming from his nose and ears so the explosions had done damage.</p>
<p>A second set went off at the far end of the hallway that Gellert had been defending. Albus grunted and smiled when Minerva struggled to stand only to collapse back down to her hands and knees. Good. She should know better than to attack them.</p>
<p>"You… won't win…" Sirius panted from behind Albus.</p>
<p>Albus ignored him as he sent his strongest stunners, four of them fired as fast and as powerfully as he could, at Filius. The first two missed as Filius dodged like a rubber ball thrown hard at the wall. The third caught his ankle, tumbling Filius to the floor. The final one caught him square in the face, knocking the little goblin out. Finally.</p>
<p>Augusta was out, slumped against a wall. Remus was shaking his head as he tried to get up, just like Minerva, but he was so dazed that he was faced in the wrong direction. Good. Let the filthy thing go off against his own allies. That would lower the number of people they needed to fight.</p>
<p>All so that they could go ten feet. Ridiculous fools.</p>
<p>"We will," Gellert said. His tone was confident, cold, controlled, but Albus could feel the way Gellert shook. Too much blood lost, damn it.</p>
<p>Albus whirled and stunned Sirius, catching him square in the chest. The idiot toppled face-first over one of his cousins, the one who lived in France and who'd refused to so much as shake Albus hand during a World Court meeting. Looked like he was dead, blood pooling under his body. Good. He deserved it.</p>
<p>"That... took out the last," Albus said, astonished. "Well done, Gellert."</p>
<p>"Why, thank you, Albus," Gellert said. His smirk was full-force, despite the blood dripping down his limp arm. "If you could possibly help me with my arm, I'd appreciate it."</p>
<p>"Certainly," Albus said.</p>
<p>Healing spells didn't work as well with his backup wand as with the Elder Wand, but Albus was a dab hand at them. After all these years, he had to be. Heaven knew, they'd done enough damage to each other in the dungeons and in various battles that they were both well beyond mastery of healing spells.</p>
<p>"Hah!"</p>
<p>The shout came with a rumble, a blast of random magical energy and a large body leaping down to slam his fists into the floor. Stones blew up off the floor, out of the walls, and cracked into both Gellert and Albus. Neither of them managed to shield properly, but their incomplete, warped, wavering shields covered enough that neither of them was brained by the flying stones.</p>
<p>"Dudley!" Draco Malfoy shouted. "Don't be an idiot!"</p>
<p>The squib. The damnable Dursley squib! Albus snarled and flung a cutting curse right at Dudley only to miss as Dudley rolled to the side and then slapped his hands together.</p>
<p>The explosion of wild magic knocked both Albus and Gellert off their feet. Albus shook his head and then grinned. Right next to the secret door.</p>
<p>"Up!" Albus shouted at Gellert. "Get in there!"</p>
<p>Gellert hefted the door open. He all but fell inside. Too much blood lost, damn it. Even healing his arm wasn't going to have Gellert back in the fight soon.</p>
<p>Behind Dudley was a small army of Hogwarts students. And Filch who had a blunderbuss in his hands. Albus snarled at him, threw several explosive fireworks their way, and whirled to go through the door.</p>
<p>Fire seared across his back.</p>
<p>"Get back here you filthy coward!" Minerva shouted at Albus. "You're not--"</p>
<p>Gellert shoved the door shut, sealed it and then used Albus' and his blood to lock it tight. As long as they lived, that door was never opening.</p>
<p>"Sit still," Gellert said. "The cutting curse went deep on your spine."</p>
<p>"Ah, that explains why my legs aren't quite cooperating," Albus said.</p>
<p>He stayed still as Gellert healed the damage. It wasn't going to be enough to bring Albus back to full strength, just as Albus' healing hadn't restored Gellert. Too much blood lost, too many battles today; they would just have to make do with what they had.</p>
<p>At least the spells should still be intact. There was no way that the Potter Brat could have…</p>
<p>Hogwarts shuddered.</p>
<p>The ambient magic shifted from resentful and faintly hostile to viciously determined. There was a youthful feel to it, a bright, hopeful, relentless feeling that made Albus' stomach turn flips. He turned to stare at Gellert who was staring up the dark passageway toward the Founder's Library.</p>
<p>"They're already there," Gellert whispered. "They've found our spells, our plans."</p>
<p>"Get me on my feet," Albus ordered in a snarl that would have done Gellert proud during their glory days. "We have to hurry before they ruin everything!"</p>
<p>+++</p>
<p>It was so dark.</p>
<p>So mean and cruel, so callous about people's hopes and dreams and joy. Harry wanted to scream as he focused everything he was, everything he had, everything Pansy and Madame Bones and Mr. Fawley had on breaking the mind control spells on Fawkes' chains.</p>
<p>Fawkes couldn't do anything.</p>
<p>Harry could feel all his power, the amazing fire that burned inside of Fawkes, but it was trapped by the spells. Just like Dudley had been trapped inside his curses. Like Mr. Malfoy had been trapped by the Dark Mark. Or Sirius and the control spells keeping him away from the Black Family Magic.</p>
<p>It was all the same thing. Every single mind control spell or curse that he'd faced was the exact same thing, just shaped a little bit differently to match what Dumbledore wanted to do.</p>
<p>Control their minds. Control their lives. Shape them to be nothing more than puppets in Dumbledore's grand game. His Greater Good.</p>
<p>The sheer thought of this being greater or good made Harry want to scream.</p>
<p>Instead he gritted his teeth and nodded to the others to start hammering away at him and his magic. They would break through. They would. He wouldn't allow anything else to happen. Fawkes would be free.</p>
<p>The whole world would be free!</p>
<p>If Harry had to die to make it happen, then so be it. He would. He would die to free them all from Dumbledore's plots, willingly, but he'd much rather win.</p>
<p>The Elves magic surged into Harry as if Kreacher had heard the thought and decided that Harry wasn't allowed to do anything as stupid as dying. Then the Black family magic, which had been quiet and focused on Sirius, flooded into Harry, too.</p>
<p>So much magic.</p>
<p>So much power, so many people all determined to stop Dumbledore.</p>
<p>The chains weren't breaking.</p>
<p>"Stop this instant!" Dumbledore yelled from the door. Not the main door, the one they'd come in through, but the other door on the other side of the room.</p>
<p>Blood splattered his face and beard. He'd lost his perfectly-bent-tip wizard hat somewhere. His glamour was gone, showing Harry and the others the real face that Dumbledore hid away from everyone; snarling, furious, hard-eyed and cold-hearted.</p>
<p>Behind him was another old man with white hair and hard, dark eyes. That man had one arm that was soaked in blood, hanging limp by his side. It didn't seem to affect the aim of his wand. </p>
<p>Grindelwald. They really were allies. Ugh.</p>
<p>"No," Harry replied. He pushed harder against the spells, throwing his whole soul against the magic that Dumbledore and Grindelwald had created. "I won't! You won't win! I won't let you!"</p>
<p>"You have no idea what you're doing," Grindelwald said in a sharp, cold snap that might have made Harry flinch long ago.</p>
<p>Not anymore. Aunt Petunia would've given him the cut direct for being that rude. Uncle Vernon would've punched him in the face. Dudley would've punched him way lower with his magic fists and that would've been the perfect response.</p>
<p>"I know exactly what I'm doing," Harry said even though Pansy was shaking and Mr. Fawley looked like he wanted to turn and fight but couldn't. "You won't distract us. This is ending now. God or Merlin or Lady Magic or whoever it is that protects against stupid wizards who think they can make the world in their own image, please help!"</p>
<p>He threw more power into the battle against the chains and then gasped when Fawkes chirped happily.</p>
<p>Suddenly Fawkes' magic flooded into Harry, too, merging and blending with the Gryffindor magic in ways that made Harry feel like he'd suddenly caught on fire. He could hear the basilisk complaining in the sewers, trapped by Dumbledore and Grindelwald's magic.</p>
<p>Harry freed her.</p>
<p>He could hear the Elves fretting about what to do now that everyone was hurt.</p>
<p>Harry directed them to get people to safety and then get them healing.</p>
<p>He could hear Dudley complaining as he tried to hammer his way through a stone door that was not ever, ever, ever going to open.</p>
<p>Harry pushed him towards helping Draco and Professor McGonagall get the walking wounded onto their feet and up the stairs.</p>
<p>He felt Aunt Petunia, upstairs, coolly directing everyone what to do, where to do it, when to do it.</p>
<p>She smiled and pushed Harry's mind back to what he should be doing.</p>
<p>"You'll destroy everything!" Dumbledore shouted at Harry. "Stop it right now! We've worked too hard for you to kill it all, you damnable child!"</p>
<p>There were flames surrounding the altar, because yes, it actually was an altar. Not a table. A sacred space that had been defiled in so many ways that Harry really, really, really wasn't going to look at, just like he really wasn't going to open a door in Gryffindor tower without knocking first.</p>
<p>"Help me, Fawkes," Harry whispered to the golden eyes so close to his. "Help me make it all better again."</p>
<p>The flames leaped higher, then swept inwards to scour the altar clean. Hogwarts rejoiced in the back of Harry's mind. She gently prodded Harry and he nodded. Blood. They needed blood of the attackers, blood of the victims, to make the spell shift into something new and better.</p>
<p>"Blood," Harry said. "Theirs, please."</p>
<p>"Done," Madame Bones snapped. She'd only put one hand on the altar at the start, keeping her wand in the free hand. A quick accio sent droplets of Dumbledore and Grindelwald's blood flying up to fall on the altar.</p>
<p>Harry nodded and smiled at Fawkes who crooned before slashing a claw across the palm of Harry's hand. He turned his hand and smacked the bloody palm into the altar before letting the spell surge into him and through him and through Fawkes.</p>
<p>Help us.</p>
<p>Help us kill this spell.</p>
<p>Help us stop this monstrosity.</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>I just want everyone to be free. Free to live their lives instead of serving Dumbledore and Grindelwald.</p>
<p>Please. Help us!</p>
<p>There were people yelling, screaming. Harry tipped his head back as the fire and power and magic of so many people screamed all together with him for freedom, for an end to the evil that Dumbledore and Grindelwald had inflicted on the world.</p>
<p>"Ah, child, you are a wonder."</p>
<p>A cool hand caressed the back of Harry's neck. He couldn't see whoever it was. He couldn't move or blink or even breathe.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Time had stopped, hadn't it?</p>
<p>"Yes, for the moment, it has," the voice said. "It's quite rare for someone to muster this many behind them. We're a bit astonished that you managed it so soon. My husband expected that it would take until you were seventeen. My brother was sure that you'd have it done by fourteen. And here we are, with you still but eleven, and you've gathered all your allies, all of what Dumbledore and Gellert know not."</p>
<p>The prophecy…!</p>
<p>"Yes," the voice agreed. "You were always to be the key. Through you the world would either be changed, or it would be doomed to continue the same patterns forever. Well done on winning free."</p>
<p>Oh, that was Aunt Petunia. She was the one who made it all happen. I just did my best with whatever was in front of me.</p>
<p>"True, true," the voice agreed. "I am quite fond of her, too, but this was your victory, my child of prophecy."</p>
<p>But they're still there, still alive and enslaving Fawkes and most everyone else they get close to?</p>
<p>Their laugh was like a bell ringing. Literally like a bell ringing. For that matter, it sounded just like the bells that rang when Harry claimed the Gryffindor magic.</p>
<p>"True," the voice agreed. "But only in this frozen moment of time. You have a choice. The terms of the ritual you created requires death. You put your whole soul into the spell, you see. All of your magic, all of everyone else's magic. Only death can set it free. And the prophecy is clear: either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives."</p>
<p>I don't want to die. I really don't.</p>
<p>"You must choose," the voice said and now it sounded like wind, like a raging storm and waves crashing against the beach when you were out without a coat or hat or even good shoes. "Either must die."</p>
<p>Harry.</p>
<p>His name was Harry James Potter. He could die. That would free everyone but…</p>
<p>Dumbledore and Grindelwald would still be alive. They'd just start over.</p>
<p>Either… must die.</p>
<p>Oh!</p>
<p>They both played at being Dumbledore! They were both in the prophecy. It wasn't Harry who had to die so that they could live. It was Dumbledore and Grindelwald who were trapped together and unable to move on as long as they were tied to each other.</p>
<p>"You do so take after your lovely mother," the voice said. They laughed again, full of joy and bells that were more like reindeer bells this time. "Very good. Choose. Which do we claim? Which survives to face punishment?"</p>
<p>Harry thought about it for a long moment that felt like minutes but was really no time at all. Who could he choose? There really wasn't a choice, now was there?</p>
<p>"Dumbledore," Harry said as time started moving again in a jerk that he felt right down to his toes. "I choose Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore!"</p>
<p>Fawkes' chains shattered under Harry's hands.</p>
<p>The fire leaped high as both Dumbledore and Grindelwald screamed.</p>
<p>Dumbledore fell to the floor, eyes rolled back in his head.</p>
<p>Then all the strength went out of Harry's legs as darkness swooped into his eyes and his brain. He saw, as he fell, Madame Bones fling a cutting curse as wide as the room at Grindelwald. Then heard a twin thud just before unconsciousness claimed him.</p>

  <p>Petunia smiled, perfectly properly, as Harry stepped forward on visibly shaking legs. He'd somehow managed to comb his hair into an even worse mangle than it had been before he started. At least his formal suit and robe looked good. Kreacher had spent hours fussing over Harry's clothes to make sure that they were right.</p>
<p>Queen Elizabeth smiled and patted Harry's shoulder gently. "Deep breath. This won't take long."</p>
<p>"Yes, your Majesty," Harry said even though his voice shook horribly.</p>
<p>Weeks of practice, weeks of tutoring. Everyone from Draco and Pansy on up to Queen Elizabeth's personal advisor had coached Harry on how to handle the ceremony in front of the Wizengamot. Pity that none of it had worked.</p>
<p>"Breathe," Petunia said in her best 'do not embarrass me' voice, the one that calmed Vernon, stilled Dudley and always brought Harry up short when he was fretting.</p>
<p>Harry looked over his shoulder, bit his lip and then nodded to her once.</p>
<p>When Harry offered his elbow to Queen Elizabeth, his elbow didn't shake nearly as badly. The queen chuckled and patted Harry's elbow before allowing him to lead her into the Wizengamot. Next to Petunia, Dudley huffed as if he wanted to be there, too. Vernon leaned against the wall, tugging at his tuxedo jacket which fit a tiny bit looser about the middle than it used to.</p>
<p>Leaving Grunnings had done them both wonders. All of them, really. Dudley had flatly refused to go back to Smeltings. He was in the new ranks of Squibs invited to join Hogwarts next year. This year he was getting special tutoring along with twenty other Squibs who'd been identified after Harry saved the world.</p>
<p>Such a thought.</p>
<p>Harry Potter, world savior.</p>
<p>James would have been laughing himself sick over it while Lily stared and stared and turned to Petunia with confusion in her eyes. Unthinkable as it was, Harry had saved them all.</p>
<p>The Phoenix of the Potters was his new title in the press. They'd dropped the Boy Who Lived nonsense within hours of That Man's death. All the reports of what Harry and the other Founders' Heirs had found and done swept away every old story of Lily and James' brave sacrifice.</p>
<p>Now the newspapers in Magical Britain were full of stories of what Those Men had done while pretending to be enemies. Generations of torture, mind control, and degradation of magical society. Thousands upon thousands of people who had been forced into lives they never would have chosen. To do things they never would have wanted. The last Petunia heard, the stories were scheduled to go on for months more.</p>
<p>Mr. Swashlin was having a glorious time suing anyone who dared to publish something about Harry or anyone else in Petunia's family without getting permission.</p>
<p>They'd not been able to prevent that horrible paparazzi woman Skeeter from getting a picture prominently featuring Harry and his new familiar, Fawkes. Thus the new title and the new claims from the stupider and less reputable papers that Harry was the second coming of Merlin.</p>
<p>"How long we gotta wait, Mum?" Dudley asked.</p>
<p>"We wait until the Queen's people say that it's time for us to go in," Petunia said for the sixteenth time today alone. "Do stand up, Dudley. No hitting anything."</p>
<p>"No, Mum," Dudley said with a frustrated sigh as he unclenched his fists and straightened his formal robe. "Dun' know why we gotta wear these stupid robes. They're right uncomfortable."</p>
<p>Petunia pressed her lips together to keep from snapping at Dudley. He was just doing it for attention. He knew how much she hated to hear him speak with that accent and he did it so that she'd notice him more. She let out a slow breath, smoothed the robe over Dudley's shoulder and then nodded when it settled properly.</p>
<p>"It's expected," Petunia told Dudley. "Any time now."</p>
<p>Sirius and Remus were already inside, in their seats. Amelia had gone in earlier, too, bracketed by Gilles Fawley and Augusta who had to use a cane now. Broken hips could be healed in the magical world but when you were as old as Augusta, they didn't tend to heal perfectly.</p>
<p>She'd asked Silverclaw about it, after the battle when they were counting up the dead and trying to save the still-living. Thankfully, only a handful had died outright. So far, they'd managed to keep all the injured alive. If they were lucky, and Petunia truly hoped that they would be, all the ones still in critical condition would turn a corner soon.</p>
<p>The magic that had always lurked under Petunia's collarbone quivered. Harry. He was worried, frightened and awed. Petunia hummed and nodded to Vernon, to Dudley. Any second now. They'd just gone in so it would be their turn to be brought in soon.</p>
<p>"If you will follow me, please," the officious little pink toad that had worked for Fudge said with a disgusting little simper. "It's time."</p>
<p>"I know," Petunia said.</p>
<p>She swept right past Umbridge who went purple in the face to be dismissed that way. The horrible woman was lucky to still be free. The things that Amelia had discovered about her during her efforts to find all of Those Men's allies. Umbridge might not have been an active ally, but she certainly wouldn't have objected to anything Those Men wanted to do.</p>
<p>The Wizengamot chamber was quite grand. It had soaring walls painted a deep, lustrous blue. The lower part was full of the Sacred Twenty-Eight sitting in their boxes. The upper levels, high up on the wall, was full of reporters and members of the public. Minerva was up there, beaming and clutching her hands to her chest while nudging Filius with her elbow. Filius grinned so widely that his mustache bristled abominably, clapping along with the crowd as Petunia crossed the chamber, Vernon and Dudley on her heels, to sit with Harry in his box.</p>
<p>"Well, this is lovely," Queen Elizabeth said. The chamber carried her words easily to every ear in the room. "We shall have to attend the Wizengamot meetings more often. It does no one good for Us to be so estranged from all of you."</p>
<p>Petunia didn't snort a laugh. Dudley and Harry both did, but one could hardly blame them. The new Minister for Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour, looked like he'd about swallowed his tongue in his effort not to protest that. Amelia, on the other hand, looked as delighted as she ever did by the prospect.</p>
<p>"We are here today to celebrate the end of several very terrible threats," Queen Elizabeth said in a much more stern, serious tone of voice that Petunia fully intended to learn to duplicate. "Our kingdom, as well as the world, have been saved by the actions of a group of very special people. The Goblins are hereby granted full citizenship for their ritual defeat and destruction of Tom Riddle, also known by that ridiculous pseudonym Lord Voldemort."</p>
<p>Harry lit up with so much joy that Petunia touched his thigh so that he wouldn't interrupt the Queen. He grinned and nodded that he'd be quiet, quivering with joy that all but radiated off him like the sun. A phoenix for a familiar did have its effects, apparently.</p>
<p>"Hogwarts has long been the premier school for magical society in Our kingdom," Queen Elizabeth continued. "It is sadly been much abused by both Dumbledore and Grindelwald. Minerva McGonagall claimed the Headmistress position in a time of crisis and acquitted herself marvelously. She is hereby confirmed in the position and authorized to hire as many new instructors and other staff as necessary to bring Hogwarts back to her full glory. I expect great things of you. Don't disappoint me."</p>
<p>Amusingly, Minerva looked like she might just faint right out of her chair, even with Filius supporting her and bouncing in his seat. Both Harry and Dudley applauded, setting off a wave of applause in the room that Queen Elizabeth just chuckled at. When she held up a hand, the applause died off.</p>
<p>"Next," Queen Elizabeth continued, her eyes on Harry now, "We must acknowledge and reward the bravery, curiosity and determination of Harry James Potter. Had you not worked so hard to bring everyone together and thrown your very soul into breaking the evil magic that those men wove, the world would be on a path to destruction. Thank you, Mr. Potter. We are all in your debt."</p>
<p>Harry went beet red as the entire chamber rose to applaud for him. It went on a rather longer than appropriate time before Queen Elizabeth held her hand up once more.</p>
<p>"We award you rulership over Hogwarts and Hogsmead, which is your right as the Heir of Gryffindor," Queen Elizabeth said. Her smile went impish. "We further award you access to the Royal Library which has a very nice selection of magical books that have long been ignored. Including several on House Elves, as We have been told that you are particularly interested in them."</p>
<p>Petunia couldn't help but laugh at Harry's delighted gasp. Dudley pounded Harry's back, grinning just as hard. She was going to have to haul them both out of the Royal Library by their ears on a regular basis. It was obvious already.</p>
<p>"The other Founders' Heirs are hereby awarded the same access," Queen Elizabeth said. She laughed when Pansy squeaked and then flung her arms around her father's waist. "You are directed to help Headmistress McGonagall improve the Hogwarts curriculum with it. As well as explore whatever information is there."</p>
<p>She turned back to Harry. No, to Petunia and Vernon. Oh dear, no, just to Petunia. Queen Elizabeth's smile was so kind, so gentle and yet so knowing.</p>
<p>"Every hero comes from somewhere," Queen Elizabeth said. "We are certain that it was your strength of will and guidance that allowed Mr. Potter to become the young man that he is. We have been informed that you have a sizable vault, legacy of your sister, Lily Potter. It is hereby doubled. We thank you, Petunia and Vernon Dursley. It is Our wish that you both be comfortable as you continue to guide Mr. Potter and young Mr. Dursley into becoming men."</p>
<p>Petunia wasn't sure exactly how red her cheeks were as the chamber applauded for the two of them. Across the way in the Black box, Sirius was bouncing much like Filius up above. Anthony stood up even though no one other than Lacey joined him. Then Augusta heaved herself upright to applaud. Harry stood, too, grinning at Petunia and Vernon with so much pride that tears welled up in Petunia's eyes.</p>
<p>Harry set off a wave of people standing, people applauding. Petunia pressed her lips together and bowed properly to Queen Elizabeth who nodded once before holding up her hand once more.</p>
<p>"Now," Queen Elizabeth said far more briskly. "Let's see what you do here. We're quite curious, quite curious indeed. Do begin the session, Mr. Scrimgeour."</p>
<p>Everyone sat down. The focus turned away from Petunia, finally. Vernon looped his arm around Petunia's shoulder as he pressed a quick kiss against her cheek. Mr. Scrimgeour was pompous, incredibly stiff, but very, very proper as he called the Wizengamot to order.</p>
<p>"Aunt Petunia?" Harry whispered a few minutes of very dry recitation of the last meeting's minutes and an agenda that promised to be even more boring as it had not one thing of substance in it.</p>
<p>"Yes?" Petunia replied, softly enough that no one outside of their box should hear it. They would notice, of course. Too many eyes were on them not to notice the little discussion.</p>
<p>"How long do we have to stay?" Harry asked.</p>
<p>"Yeah, Mum," Dudley agreed with a grimace. "This looks boring."</p>
<p>Petunia sighed. Across the chamber, Queen Elizabeth's eyes were dancing with laughter as if she'd heard exactly what Harry and Dudley said. Well. She was a mother of three young boys. She certainly knew how this went.</p>
<p>"We stay until the Queen leaves," Petunia told them. "You can sit quietly or read, but no chatting. It's rude."</p>
<p>Both Harry and Dudley grimaced. They went back to listening and fidgeting. Ah well, they'd pull out one of Harry's book trunks soon enough. Hopefully soon. Something to distract them would be good.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, after the boys had each claimed a book from Harry's Inaccurate Information trunk, Vernon leaned close to Petunia's ear.</p>
<p>"Seriously, Pet," Vernon whispered, "how long do we have to stay?"</p>
<p>The End</p>
