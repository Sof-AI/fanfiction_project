Steps to updating v8:
1) Copy/paste URLs to be added to v8 (can be any URL, will be sorted out later)
2) run update.py (in VS Code or terminal)
3) Import newly-updated output.csv into v8 in Google Sheets
4) Copy/paste appropriate info
5) Deal with runoffs 1-3 (can copy/paste to otherUrls.txt in 2STORAGE)
6) Clear contents of: input.txt, output.csv, and runoffs 1-3

Documents
- update.py - script that takes URLs from input.txt & writes list-ified versions to output.csv
- input.txt - the input-URLs to add to v8
- output.csv - the output list-ified versions of the input URLs (import to Google Sheets)
- runoff1.txt - URLs - all non-AO3-work URLs
- runoff2.txt - ficNums - all the ficNums that couldn't be list-ified
- runoff3.txt - ficNums - all the ficNums that couldn't be written to output.csv

- In Storage
	- v8Archive.txt - where ALL ficNums ever added to v8 are stored (used for reference)
	- otherUrls.txt - somewhere to copy/paste all the runoff to deal with later
