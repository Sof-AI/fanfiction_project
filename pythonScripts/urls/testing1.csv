Hiccup is also a teenager. He will drink, swear, and encounter sexuality. He will NOT have a OTL. He is not loose, or a player. He has standards, he will be picky. Hiccup has a backbone—grown and fertilized by travel experiences, life choices, and a dragon.</p><p>There will be gods and mythology.  There will be book references and attempted historical accuracy.

It couldn’t even be an easy job, of course, because Edward’s assessment of Truth was a pretty accurate one.</p>",[],"<p>This story is a bit of a self-indulgent whim that I’ve been working on for the last week, a mix of my resurfacing love for FMA (manga and Brotherhood) and having gone through the FMA/HP crossover section one too many times. It’s a whim I intend to complete, though (I waited to post until the entire thing was plotted out to my satisfaction), and it’s a long story. I cannot promise any frequency for the updates (and I’m crap at keeping up with those anyway, when I do), but I wanted to make that point clear. There will be semi-regular updates at first, though, because I have the first three chapters in process.</p><p>I’m working from the premise that Truth only agrees to return what it’s taken under very specific circumstances (from the conversation with Ed, I gather giving up his alchemy was the only payment Truth would’ve accepted for Al), and Roy’s case is a bit of an exception as far as opening the Gate is concerned (I think that’s the only reason the Stone worked for him in canon, because there was no ‘lesson’ to be learnt from the experience). But that Stone was made from a handful of people and saw a lot of use before Roy had it, so I took that thought and ran with it.</p><p>This chapter is a little longer than I expect the others to be, but I wanted to reach a certain point in the story before cutting it.</p>","<p>A little background that I doubt will come up in the plot: this story takes place a week after the Promised Day. Roy agreed to be healed after Havoc, but it took a few days to bring Havoc to Central because of the generalized chaos that followed the battle. He had his hands healed because the way Bradley impaled them would’ve broken a good deal of the bones in them (how Roy moves them after the battle makes no sense, it should have been excruciating, especially once the adrenaline was gone) and it would have been a very long recovery with not very good odds of him ever being able to use them properly. Hence, Marcoh healed the bones. During that week, Roy was stuck in hospital, there were a great number of wounded in the battle, many of whom needed hospitalization, which meant no individual rooms. Al, of course, had to be hospitalized, but Ed refused to let him share a room with just anyone, even if that anyone was a soldier who fought on their side. As much as they argue, Ed trusts Roy and Roy trusts Ed, so it was decided that Roy and Al would share a room. In deference to Al, they attempted to keep bickering to a minimum, and trying to find topics of conversation that weren’t depressing usually resulted in alchemy-related talk. Roy learnt to handle clap alchemy more consciously, and Ed found a kind of perverse pleasure in showing him some of the weirdest arrays he knew. Al had to transmute them so Roy could feel the shape, but it worked to pass the time once they figured out how to do it without Roy accidentally activating it (they just didn’t close the circle entirely).

It’s a whim I intend to complete, though (I waited to post until the entire thing was plotted out to my satisfaction), and it’s a long story. I cannot promise any frequency for the updates (and I’m crap at keeping up with those anyway, when I do), but I wanted to make that point clear. There will be semi-regular updates at first, though, because I have the first three chapters in process.</p><p>I’m working from the premise that Truth only agrees to return what it’s taken under very specific circumstances (from the conversation with Ed, I gather giving up his alchemy was the only payment Truth would’ve accepted for Al), and Roy’s case is a bit of an exception as far as opening the Gate is concerned (I think that’s the only reason the Stone worked for him in canon, because there was no ‘lesson’ to be learnt from the experience). But that Stone was made from a handful of people and saw a lot of use before Roy had it, so I took that thought and ran with it.</p><p>This chapter is a little longer than I expect the others to be, but I wanted to reach a certain point in the story before cutting it.</p>","<p>A little background that I doubt will come up in the plot: this story takes place a week after the Promised Day. Roy agreed to be healed after Havoc, but it took a few days to bring Havoc to Central because of the generalized chaos that followed the battle. He had his hands healed because the way Bradley impaled them would’ve broken a good deal of the bones in them (how Roy moves them after the battle makes no sense, it should have been excruciating, especially once the adrenaline was gone) and it would have been a very long recovery with not very good odds of him ever being able to use them properly.

<p>Usually, I can deal with plotholes. I am very good at suspending disbelief and merely enjoying the story as it comes. But sometimes they are so egregious that they really get my back up, and one of the biggest is the 'Oh Shit' plothole that is Naruto's use of kage bunshin. By 'Oh Shit', I mean that Kishimoto-sensei and his creative team went 'Oh shit!' halfway through Part II when they realized that they had to figure out a way for Naruto to train really quickly and learn a ton of stuff in a short period of time. To do this, they tried to sell us the idea that Naruto was so stupid that he <i>didn't realize up until this point that he was receiving the memories of his dispersed clones.</i></p>
<p>I understand why they did this. It was a quick, easy fix, and developed the world of Naruto a little more. But I've never bought into the idea that Naruto is stupid, or oblivious, or unobservant. Yes, he doesn't understand a lot of the stuff around him; I attribute this to him being an extremely kinesthetic learner, as well as having an absolutely shit upbringing with zero parental influence. I've studied childhood development, and there are empirical reasons to why children with supportive, educated parents do better in school than children whose parents spend less time with them and can't support them in their studies (not necessarily through any fault of their own). Naruto had zero support in his education growing up; that does not make him stupid.</p>
<p>Tl;dr I really wanted to address the massive plothole of Naruto not realizing the kage bunshin's abilities until halfway through the series. Also, I wanted to write a self-indulgent fix-it. I have like three more of these sitting in my google docs waiting for me to finish them. OTL</p>

I've wanted to write something in the Wickedverse/Ozverse for a long time; this fanfic has basically been in the works for well over a year. I always loved The Wizard Of Oz (in fact, I backed the Smithsonian's Kickstarter to restore the Ruby Slippers to their former glory). In fact, I've been reading through the books of late, and just polished off the seventh before calling this story ready to start editing. Then I saw Wicked about two years ago, and it gave me SO much inspiration that I immediately scribbled down a rough outline for a fic. So this has been overdue, and I'm glad to finally get it out there.</p><p>This is mostly based on the play, but I'll take small bits and pieces from the novel (and from the original Oz universe) to round out certain details. If there's anything that seems slightly off, that would be the reason; the mish-mashing. Also, it didn't turn out quite the way I planned in about a thousand ways; I have a habit of letting my stories run away from me and do whatever they want, but this is one of the ""worst"" in that regard. It's going to start slow, burn slow, and end… somewhere you might not be expecting. Even I didn't expect it! Also, I hope this type of story hasn't been done before, but I'd rather write it than go digging through other fics to double-check, haha.</p><p>Also, word of warning: Gelphie isn't the only ship that's going to be represented.

I've wanted to write something in the Wickedverse/Ozverse for a long time; this fanfic has basically been in the works for well over a year. I always loved The Wizard Of Oz (in fact, I backed the Smithsonian's Kickstarter to restore the Ruby Slippers to their former glory). In fact, I've been reading through the books of late, and just polished off the seventh before calling this story ready to start editing. Then I saw Wicked about two years ago, and it gave me SO much inspiration that I immediately scribbled down a rough outline for a fic. So this has been overdue, and I'm glad to finally get it out there.</p><p>This is mostly based on the play, but I'll take small bits and pieces from the novel (and from the original Oz universe) to round out certain details. If there's anything that seems slightly off, that would be the reason; the mish-mashing. Also, it didn't turn out quite the way I planned in about a thousand ways; I have a habit of letting my stories run away from me and do whatever they want, but this is one of the ""worst"" in that regard. It's going to start slow, burn slow, and end… somewhere you might not be expecting. Even I didn't expect it! Also, I hope this type of story hasn't been done before, but I'd rather write it than go digging through other fics to double-check, haha.</p><p>Also, word of warning: Gelphie isn't the only ship that's going to be represented. It's the focus for most of the first two parts, but there's more going on in this fic than just that. Sorry if you get bored in the non-Gelphie-focused sections!</p><p>Though in third person, a very large percentage of the story is from Glinda's limited perspective.

When he heard Wei Wuxian was about to be kicked out of the Jiang Sect, a lovesick and protective Lan Wangji jumped in and asked to buy a pet contract from him, intending to simply never ask Wei Wuxian for any normal pet duties and let him go on studying cultivation like before.</p><p>The trick is going to be Wei Wuxian realizing he WANTS to be doing normal pet duties (e.g. getting fed lotus seeds on Lan Wangji's lap, sucking LWJ's dick during boring court events, wearing impossibly slutty outfits and ropes of pearls while flirting shamelessly with LWJ in front of their old school friends, getting held down and railed till he cries, etc...)

Meng Yao's domming-from-below probably starts with directing Lan Xichen exactly how to use Meng Yao during court events...</p><p>I also had vague thoughts about Lan Xichen giving Lan Zhan a how-to-have-sex talk using Meng Yao for his demonstration...so have fun with that if you want!</p><p><b>Canon version(s)?</b><br/>No strong preference.

(Possibly JFM died suddenly and is thus no longer bribing the right officials? Maybe Madame Yu discovered something in JFM's papers? Was Wei Changze JFM's pet before his marriage to Madame Yu?) At any rate, Wei Wuxiann gets rather abruptly recruited to be the first pet of Duke Lan's (Emperor Lan's?) second son.</p><p>He has no ""pet"" training and has no idea what he's meant to be doing. Lan Wangji has no idea what to do with him either. They know each other from those 3 months they attended the Imperial Academy together, before Wei Wuxian got expelled; as in canon, Lan Wangji fell hard, then didn't say anything about it to Wei Wuxian, who is somewhat under the impression Lan Wangji dislikes him immensely. When he heard Wei Wuxian was about to be kicked out of the Jiang Sect, a lovesick and protective Lan Wangji jumped in and asked to buy a pet contract from him, intending to simply never ask Wei Wuxian for any normal pet duties and let him go on studying cultivation like before.</p><p>The trick is going to be Wei Wuxian realizing he WANTS to be doing normal pet duties (e.g. getting fed lotus seeds on Lan Wangji's lap, sucking LWJ's dick during boring court events, wearing impossibly slutty outfits and ropes of pearls while flirting shamelessly with LWJ in front of their old school friends, getting held down and railed till he cries, etc...) And then he has to get Lan Wangji to believe his wants are genuine.</p><p>Lan Xichen in the background has Meng Yao for his pet, gifted to him - secondhand, as it were - by Nie Mingjue. This is practically a whole secondary prompt, and feel free to focus only on this bit, but I imagine power bottom!Meng Yao trying to figure out how to get LXC to admit to himself that he, LXC, actually wants to be on the other side of the master/pet dynamic, and that furthermore, he wants NMJ and MY domming him from above and below (or behind and in front) simultaneously. Meng Yao's domming-from-below probably starts with directing Lan Xichen exactly how to use Meng Yao during court events...</p><p>I also had vague thoughts about Lan Xichen giving Lan Zhan a how-to-have-sex talk using Meng Yao for his demonstration...so have fun with that if you want!</p><p><b>Canon version(s)?</b><br/>No strong preference. As long as there's lube.</p><p><b>Notes about warnings/squicks/triggers/NOTPs:</b><br/>Depending on how soon this is set after WWX and LWJ knew each other at Cloud Recesses/Imperial Academy, they both might be under 18, but I'm assuming it's been a few years and they're 17-18ish at the youngest. LWJ is maybe just turning 18 because he's now old enough for his first pet?<br/>Squicks include scat, gore, bugs.</p>","<p>Some our our faves were not provided birth names in canon. As they are important to the world here, I had to invent them (don't murder me).</p><p>I did put Actual Effort into this, but I do not speak Mandarin, and my understanding of Chinese names is limited to what a few hours of Google can provide.

If I get the inspo, I may type up that conversation, but I wanted to marriage thing to COMPLETELY BLINDSIDE here.

Dude, your monstrous demon ancestors are watching you repeatedly take yourself out on low doorways and they're fucking embarrassed for you. </p><p>- <em>""Well, except for the occasional monster-focused weirdo.""</em> *cough* Shen Yuan. *cough* </p><p>(But also, like, me too, man.) </p><p>- Shang Qinghua: ""Mobei-Jun might maybe spare my life because I know how to make bath bombs?""<br/>Mobei-Jun: ""I'm already looking into family planning, by which I mean I'm plotting my father and uncle's deaths and I've already figured out how we're going to have children. Be prepared to abandon your sect at a moment's notice to begin planning our wedding."" </p><p>- EDIT: I'm headcanoning here that MBJ did actually <em>kind of</em> discuss marriage with SQH, but because MBJ was incapable of being explicit about his romantic intent because he was SUPER NERVOUS, the entire awkward conversation flew completely over Shang Qinghua's head. MBJ left that conversation like, ""He's open to marrying me!"" SQH left that conversation like, ""Fuck, I need to drop off those forms for my shifu."" If I get the inspo, I may type up that conversation, but I wanted to marriage thing to COMPLETELY BLINDSIDE here.

The Elemental Nations do not co-exist with the HP universe. Rather the Naruto Characters who appear in this have died and remember dying (so #trauma-ahoy! or maybe not - who knows?). Additionally, chakra isn't magic in this, and there are rules regarding chakra usage alongside magic, so be prepared for that.

I'm aiming for no bashing in this fic - because I inherently dislike bashing, and thereby pretty much tend to avoid it - all the characters have their reasons for doing what they do.</p><p>This is going to be Canon Divergent and Not Canon Compliant, meaning there will be characters you've never seen before, as well as characters alive who should be dead, and also some characters which might act different to their canon counterparts because of the original characters as well as the reincarnated shinobi, along with parts of history which might be altered somewhat, so please keep that in mind. This is also my first crossover with the HP Fandom, so here's to hoping you'll find this interesting, whether you've read another of my works before or not.</p><p>I aimed with this work to steer away from the whole 'ninja on a mission to protect so and so' or 'Harry Potter is an Uchiha' or 'someone stumbles into a different dimension shindig'. The Elemental Nations do not co-exist with the HP universe. Rather the Naruto Characters who appear in this have died and remember dying (so #trauma-ahoy! or maybe not - who knows?). Additionally, chakra isn't magic in this, and there are rules regarding chakra usage alongside magic, so be prepared for that. Along with some worldbuilding probably.</p><p>Hope you enjoy.</p>",,ao3,Teen And Up Audiences,['No Archive Warnings Apply'],['Gen'],"[['Naruto', '/tags/Naruto/works'], ['Harry Potter - J. K.

<p>If anyone else said that, Meng Yao would leave a scratch across their face deep enough to scar. Instead, his whole being aches with want for the same, and he realizes in a hazy cloud of dread that he might actually be falling in love. Truly falling in love. The kind that there is no coming back from.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Alternative story-line where Lan Xichen breaks down Meng Yao's walls as they fall in love, just as Lan Wangji broke down Wei WuXian's in canon. A healthier, stronger relationship ensues.</p>",[],"<p>This fic is based loosely off canon events, so it's basically just me taking liberties with everything that happened. You will find familiar events and a roughly similar timeline to canon, but a change in anyone's behavior will set off the butterfly effect-- maybe greatly, maybe barely. So don't be thrown if things unfold differently. </p>
<p>I find I'm unable to move on from the tragic XiYao ending, and I am an unabashed JGY apologist. I've thought a lot about how things might have been ""if only."" And what catches me most is: What if Meng Yao had trusted Lan Xichen enough to open up to him about his dark thoughts? His personal torments? The chains of society he can't break legally? In turn, what if Lan Xichen hadn't waited for Meng Yao to open up to him, therefore intervening before it's too late for his redemption? </p>
<p>A few things to note:</p>
<p>1- I am no fan of Nie Mingjue. I have no intentions of butchering his character, but I have delved deeper into the clues I picked up on in canon and I didn't sugar coat it. No, hes not a monstrous, raping, killing machine; however, he definitely has... issues. Such as anger problems, inability to see from others pov's, indifference to Meng Yao's unfair treatment and Nie Huaisang's delicate nature, unhealthy obsession with Meng Yao -- both emotionally and sexually, to name a few.</p>
<p>2- I believe strongly that Meng Yao cared for and respected Nie Mingjue. Until. And you will see this unfold here.</p>
<p>3- The Lan Clan Love Curse is a real thing in this fic. The details of it will be revealed, but rest assured his feelings for Meng Yao are entirely his own. They aren't falsified by an enchantment.</p>
<p>4- Nie Huaisang has a huge one-sided crush on Wei Wuxian.</p>
<p>5- I also believe that Nie Huaisang really loved and cared about Meng Yao-- I wanted to portray their relationship in this way and sustain it. </p>
<p>This fic is being beta read by magic__mind.</p>
<p>Last note:  I don't know a lick of Chinese. I went back and forth on how to use names in this, and decided to use them according to how I normally see them used in fic.
