I finally found a good idea for a novella, though, and we decided to write it up.<br/>The story here is that Matilda Honey (formerly Matilda Wormwood) from the Roald Dahl story is a witch and (obviously) goes to Hogwarts. Based on the publication date of the book, she arrives in Harry’s fourth year, and hilarity ensues.</p><p>Note that while I’m setting this in Britain like the book, this story will otherwise be based on the movie, since that has more magic in it and is better in my opinion. As a novella-length story, this will most be the highlights of Matilda’s time at Hogwarts.

<p>As you've probably noticed, Orochimaru's relationship with gender is... well. It is canon that at least at one point during the series he was walking around in a female body and was totally fine with it. Not too long ago it was also confirmed in Boruto manga, that Orochimaru likes to change the way he looks, switching between more male-ish version of himself and the very feminine-like looks from Boruto (at least according to the images.)<br/>So. Jack deciding that this new person is a woman? Not a joke. Orochimaru is wearing what he finds more comfortable at the moment. I doubt that he gives a crap about pronouns either - whatever is fine, as long as his name is recognized and used correctly.</p>
<p>I also like to believe that he's currently using Zetsu as his body- either the same one he took over during the final part of the manga (Hashirama cells were supposed to regenerate easily, so it should withstand Orochimaru's presence inside much better than any human) or one he cloned for himself.

<p>The original prompt was for Dream SMP c!Tubbo but I thought it would be funny if IRL cc!Tubbo was a god, so I switched it up a little!</p>
<p>I hope you like it!</p>

<p>Warnings: Mentions of:<br/>Vomiting (briefly and not about people),<br/>Viruses (Bubonic plague, coronavirus).</p>","<p>Tyrannosauruses and Spinosauri both existed during the cretaceous period, but at different times within that period, so Tubbo had plenty of time to fight both.</p>

<p>Tubbo lost a lot of people to the Black Death but he also helped to save a lot of people. He can’t get sick, which definitely helped. </p>
<p>Tubbo terrorized people in a Robin Hood kind of way during the Dark Ages. He would fuck with the rich, especially when they were being nasty to the poor. That kind of thing.</p>
<p>The quote “I have seen far more than you ever will, Philza. Eons are mere child’s play compared to the time I have been watching over these worlds.” is directly from Arson_Bee’s prompt! (the fic title is also from this quote)</p>

Fairytales are often piled upon– one magic spell becomes two. A mother changes the prince’s name to her own dear son.
