  <span> “Vod, I want to make you a </span>
  <em>captain,</em>
  <span>” Cody protested, amazed. “You'd be Skywalker's right hand.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> Rex gave a protracted shrug, the gesture helpless. “It doesn't have to make sense, Cody. I know I've only known him a few weeks, but I </span>
  <em>want </em>
  <span>to volunteer.”</span>
</p><p>“We can get him another anooba. I'm sure we—”</p><p>
  <span> “General Kenobi's not going to be </span>
  <em>more </em>
  <span>willing to put a </span>
  <em>different </em>
  <span>one in battle when he insisted on leaving</span>
  <em> his </em>
  <span>at home.”<br/>
“It's a dead-end career,” Cody warned, knowing the argument was already lost.</span>
</p><p>Rex smiled, a strange, quiet glow. “I know.”</p><p>“Don't look so damn happy about it,” Cody muttered.</p><p> </p><p>* * *</p><p> </p><p>He'd seen the General in combat. Hair lit by a dying sun so it gleamed like gold aflame, a vision of destruction and salvation both as he unleashed himself against droids to save his men, his brother, his grand-Padawan, and any hapless civilians in the area.</p><p>He'd seen the man move an AT-TE with his mind, and tremendous burdens with his arm.</p><p>He'd seen Death itself in the unfocused, beautiful eyes—</p><p>And infinite compassion when he drew pain away from a wounded clone.</p><p>He'd seen him whisper peace into diplomatic arguments others thought hopeless. He'd seen him dance with such grace that it left politicians agape in stunned disbelief as the blind man displayed more skill than those with eyes possessed.</p><p>He'd seen him, exhausted, wounded, in a hopeless situation refusing to give up. Taking one agonized step after the other, renewing hope in those who'd lost it all, carrying a lost child on his back with the tenderness of a mother.</p><p>
  <span> Rex had </span>
  <em>seen.</em>
</p><p>And now this creature stood quiet, expression peaceful, fingers resting so lightly in the crook of Rex's elbow, the pressure so gentle, almost dainty—</p><p>A hand he'd seen crush a droid's head, when he had no other option for saving a life. A hand he'd seen drive a lightsaber into monsters' hearts. A hand he'd seen clenched as Obi-Wan wept for the beings he'd failed to save.</p><p>
  <em>He's so many things, all at once.</em>
</p><p>Rex's gaze drifted from the fingers connecting him to Obi-Wan, allowing his eyes to find Obi-Wan's face. The calm sweetness around his mouth. An expression worn not by anger, but by smiles and grief.</p><p>
  <em>How can he, who has lost so much, turn his face to the sun and thank the Force for what he still has?</em>
</p><p>Obi-Wan's head cocked, then turned to Rex. “What is it?” he whispered, eyes looking past him. “You are looking at me?”</p><p>“You can feel that?”<br/>
“You never experience the feeling of being watched?”</p><p>“Sorry, Sir.”<br/>
“...Master Kenobi?”</p><p>Rex's eyes darted back to the holo of the Chancellor, who now looked peeved. Rex felt just a little embarrassed.</p><p>Obi-Wan's head turned in the older man's direction, and a small smile graced his lips. “I'm sorry, I believe I missed that last bit. Would you do me the courtesy of repeating?”</p><p>Palpatine's lip curled, just a little. It both amused and annoyed Rex.</p><p>
  <em>Everyone can see his worth except for you. </em>
  <span>Maybe Palpatine deserved a little ignoring.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>Yeah, Rex. That's not a safe thought.</em>
</p><p>“I am concerned about Anakin,” Palpatine explained again, his extremely worried tone lost in something that sounded more like strained patience. “He's always running ahead and throwing himself in danger's path, and with you unable to keep up, I worry, Master Kenobi. I begin to wonder if another Jedi could better his chances for survival. I know it would be dreadful for you to transfer to another part of the war, but shouldn't Anakin's needs come first?”</p><p>
  <span> Rex frowned. </span>
  <em>You want to break up the Team?</em>
</p><p>Obi-Wan smiled.</p><p>
  <span> Rex had liked his smile before, but now that the beard was gone, he could see the dimples, see how young the Jedi looked, see the almost gentle expression. He fondly patted Rex's arm. “Thanks to the Captain, I am not so </span>
  <em>very </em>
  <span>far behind.” His light tone matched his unburdened smile.</span>
</p><p>This clearly was not the response Palpatine had expected— Rex either, for that matter.</p><p>
  <em>I'm not a captain.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>* * *</p><p> </p><p>It was after the call that Rex searched Obi-Wan's face and asked the question burdening him.</p><p>Obi-Wan smiled. “You've served with me for five months,” he explained. “I think it's time for a promotion. I don't want your career to suffer because of your generosity to me. The datawork's in, we are simply waiting for the confirmation it's been logged.”</p><p>Rex's heart stuttered.</p><p>Obi-Wan's fingers ghosted over his chest, and the Jedi chuckled. “That was gratifying.”<br/>
“Thank you, Sir.”<br/>
“You deserve it, Captain.”</p><p> </p><p>* * *</p><p> </p><p>“Ever been to Naboo before, Sir?”</p><p>The battle over, the soldiers dismissed, General Skywalker busy, and Obi-Wan, staring off at nothing in silence.</p><p>Obi-Wan stirred, turned his head to Rex. “Once.”</p><p>“Feel good to be back?”<br/>
“There is a place I would like to revisit. Could you help me locate the power generation complex? It's adjacent to this hangar. Giant doors. I just need you to make sure I don't walk off a walkway.”</p><p>“Sure.” Rex stepped away—</p><p>“Where are you going?” Obi-Wan asked, puzzled.</p><p>“To tell General Skywalker where we're headed. He's right over there.”</p><p>“He's speaking with the Senator, isn't he?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>Obi-Wan gave a nod. “Let's not cut into the short time he has with her. I doubt he'll notice we've gone missing.”</p><p>It was an odd thing to say, but Rex returned, tucked Obi-Wan's hand into his elbow, and followed Obi-Wan's verbal instructions.</p><p>“So what's in this power generator?” Rex asked as they navigated spindly walkways.</p><p>
  <em>Thank the </em>
  <span>Force </span>
  <em>he didn't attempt this on his own!</em>
  <span> Rex shuddered at the thought. Yes, Obi-Wan's senses were </span>
  <em>good, </em>
  <span>but to risk it when there was no need...</span>
</p><p>
  <span> “A memory.”<br/>
“A good one?” Rex asked, though pretty sure the answer was </span>
  <em>yes.</em>
</p><p>
  <span> Obi-Wan was silent for a long enough time that Rex began to wonder if he should have kept his mouth shut. Then the Jedi spoke, his voice quiet. “It's where my master entrusted to me the greatest gift he ever gave me.”<br/>
</span>
  <em>Ah. </em>
  <span>Rex decided to wait and see, instead of asking questions.</span>
</p><p>Obi-Wan never spoke of his master.</p><p>
  <em>Why haven't I met him?</em>
</p><p>
  <span> Seeing how close Obi-Wan and Anakin were, he wondered if perhaps there had been a schism. Why else would Rex not even know the man's </span>
  <em>name</em>
  <span>?</span>
</p><p>“Ray shields here, Sir.”<br/>
They passed through three before they closed. Waiting for them to cycle through again, Rex felt the fingers on his arm tightening, just a little. He looked down at the calm face, saw just a hint of worry about the mouth.</p><p>They cleared another few shields, ended caught by the last one—</p><p>A little gasp escaped Obi-Wan, and he paled.</p><p>“Are you alright, General?”<br/>
He gave a determined nod. “Yes. Thank you.”<br/>
They stepped into the circular chamber, and Rex looked for anything that might be worth revisiting—</p><p>Obi-Wan stepped forward, drawing Rex after him instead of the other way around, and then he let go of the clone's arm and sank to the floor, reaching out a shaking hand to place the palm to the cold, smooth surface.</p><p>Obi-Wan's head bowed, and his eyes closed.</p><p>Rex politely looked away.</p><p>After a long moment, a mournful voice wafted up from where the Jedi huddled on the floor. “I need to get drunk.”<br/>
Rex started at the unexpected statement. “Sir?”<br/>
“It would be faster if you went and found something intoxicating than if we went together and came back. I'll wait for you.”</p><p>
  <span> This was </span>
  <em>all </em>
  <span>kinds of </span>
  <em>not normal.</em>
</p><p>“Is everything alright, Sir?”<br/>
“No. Nothing's been alright since that accursed day. Get me drunk enough and I might tell you.”</p><p>
  <span> “I'll be right back.” There was no way in heck Rex was going to leave him </span>
  <em>alone </em>
  <span>like this, so as he moved to obey the command, he also commed Ahsoka and demanded she or Skywalker get down here.</span>
</p><p>The Commander didn't know where her master was, but she said she was on her way.</p><p>That was going to have to be good enough.</p><p> </p><p>* * *</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> “Hey.” Ahsoka tried to sound casual, though the excuse </span>
  <em>I was walking by </em>
  <span>would be anything but believable given how much </span>
  <em>intentionality </em>
  <span>it took to reach this place without dying. “What are you doing down here?”<br/>
She lowered herself to sit beside Obi-Wan, their backs to the curved wall.</span>
</p><p>“An evening of drunk self-pity, if I have my way. Otherwise, just self-pity.”<br/>
Ahsoka squinted at him, baffled by how wretched he both looked and felt in the Force. “But we won. And the casualties were lower than they've ever been.”</p><p>For a long moment she wasn't sure he was going to elaborate.</p><p>And then, low spoken, “Can you imagine what it's like to lose a master, Ahsoka?”</p><p>“No. But Anakin knows.”</p><p>“Anakin.” The word was sorrowful. “Anakin has never loved me, Ahsoka. He used to fantasize about my death.” A heavy sigh escaped him.</p><p>
  <em>What?</em>
</p><p>“I don't think he ever knew I knew. But he— he projected.” Eyelids blinked rapidly, trying to hold back evidence of pain and grief.</p><p>Ahsoka watched in growing horror.</p><p>“His anger is not that I went. It's that I came back.”</p><p>“That's not true!”</p><p>“I need to— I'm going to go now, Ahsoka. Sleep well.” He stood.</p><p>
  <span> Ahsoka bolted to her feet. “I don't think so!” she protested. “You're not going over those walkways </span>
  <em>alone</em>
  <span>. Either I come with you, or you wait for Rex.”</span>
</p><p>“Wait for me for what?” Rex looked both suspicious and worried at the same time.</p><p>Obi-Wan's head turned in his direction. “Captain. I wish to retire to my quarters on the Negotiator.”</p><p>“I thought you wanted to stay here a while—?”</p><p>“I've changed my mind.” Obi-Wan reached out, and Rex guided his hand to the waiting elbow.</p><p>“Probably just as well. I decided I couldn't in good conscience bring you alcohol when you had to navigate narrow bridges with no hand-railings over a bottomless drop.”</p><p>“Good thing the only drop in my quarters should be from the chair to the floor.”</p><p>
  <span> Ahsoka's eyes widened in shock. </span>
  <em>This needs to get fixed. And him passing out on the floor isn't going to fix it.</em>
</p><p>
  <span>She didn't care </span>
  <em>what </em>
  <span>Skyguy was doing. There was nowhere he could hide from her, not for something this important.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>* * *</p><p> </p><p>“This had better be good, Ahsoka,” Anakin growled, his hair mussed and eyes glittering.</p><p>
  <em>You could at least try to be subtle. How can you think none of us know?</em>
  <span> “Master Obi-Wan thinks you don't love him.”</span>
</p><p>An ugly frown took over Anakin's face. “That self-focused bastard,” he muttered.</p><p>
  <span> “What I don't get,” Ahsoka interrupted over the top of his grumbling, “is why he was in the generator, or why he's </span>
  <em>so </em>
  <span>sad. It's like a black hole of pain inside him. It was difficult to look at directly, it was so awful. He wanted Rex to help him get drunk. Master Obi-Wan doesn't </span>
  <em>do </em>
  <span>drunk, right? I've never even seen him tips—”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> “</span>
  <em>Kark,</em>
  <span>” Anakin yelped, leaping forward past Ahsoka and racing down the hall.</span>
</p><p>“...Master?”</p><p>But he was gone, clearly in Obi-Wan's direction—</p><p>
  <em>Oh, Master Kenobi, I hope I did the right thing.</em>
</p><p> </p><p>* * *</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> Obi-Wan had </span>
  <em>just now </em>
  <span>managed to pry the bottle from Rex's durasteel fingers, put his back to the clone and </span>
  <em>pushed </em>
  <span>and slid the man's feet across the floor until he could get the door closed, and then struggled with the sealed container until he finally managed to get the damn thing open.</span>
</p><p>He'd just lifted it to his lips when the door slammed open again and Anakin charged in. The bottle was swiped out of his hand before he even had a chance to taste the stuff.</p><p>
  <span> “</span>
  <em>Anakin,</em>
  <span>” he sighed. </span>
  <em>This </em>
  <span>had to be the </span>
  <em>one time </em>
  <span>Anakin could tear his eyes and hands away from Padmé? What kind of cruel cosmic joke was that? The one evening Obi-Wan should be able to count on being completely, utterly uninterrupted—</span>
</p><p>“Ahsoka says you think I don't love you.”<br/>
And then the fight just died inside him. He was too sad and miserable to be put out anymore, and the tone of Anakin's voice, the fear there—</p><p>
  <em>No, no. I won't leave you. </em>
  <span>“It's alright, Anakin,” he soothed. “I've always known.”</span>
</p><p>“What.”<br/>
Not for the first time, Obi-Wan wished he could see his face. “I wasn't the master you wanted, and the man who... the man you did want is dead because of me.” The Force was sparkling with something awful, something horrified— “It's alright, Anakin. It's alright.”</p><p>
  <span> Why was he so traumatized by this? Wasn't he </span>
  <em>hearing </em>
  <span>that Obi-Wan </span>
  <em>clearly </em>
  <span>didn't hold it against him—? He'd been alone for an eternity, why would Anakin think that </span>
  <em>today </em>
  <span>would be the point where he walked away and abandoned them all?</span>
</p><p>“Do you feel completely alone?” Anakin asked, voice low. Almost... something, but Obi-Wan couldn't decide whether it was aggressive or angry. “What about Rex?”<br/>
A wave of incredible loneliness swept over Obi-Wan. “He's doing his job. His duty. And he does it well, and he is very kind to me. He brought me alcohol. Now please be just as thoughtful and release your hostage—”</p><p>“Ahsoka, then? She cried when she thought you were dead.”</p><p>
  <span> The morbid humor Obi-Wan had attempted to seize slipped through his fingers, leaving him feeling as if he'd fallen flat on his face and broken his nose. A noise escaped him before he had a chance to stay it, a noise that sounded too much like mockery for Obi-Wan's comfort. No. He wasn't trying to make fun of </span>
  <em>Ahsoka, </em>
  <span>she was a precious heart, kind and— Obi-Wan needed to explain. “She hurt for </span>
  <em>you. </em>
  <span>Not me. She wasn't grieving for me. She was grieving for what she thought it would do to you.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>* * *</p><p> </p><p>
  <span> He looked so earnest, so worried Anakin would assume he thought </span>
  <em>poorly </em>
  <span>of Ahsoka, completely </span>
  <em>missing </em>
  <span>the horrifying truth lurking in his words.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> “You don't think </span>
  <em>anyone </em>
  <span>loves you?” Anakin's voice wasn't quite steady anymore.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> Obi-Wan's own voice, thick with feeling, protested with a longsuffering, “Anakin</span>
  <em>—</em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> “No. </span>
  <em>No. </em>
  <span>You don't believe anyone loves you.” The stunned discovery in Anakin's tone made Obi-Wan visibly cringe. “But </span>
  <em>Qui-Gon </em>
  <span>loved you!”</span>
</p><p>“Anakin, please don't,” Obi-Wan choked.</p><p>
  <span> Realization dawned, cold and ugly. “You... don't even believe he loved you,” he breathed. </span>
  <em>How </em>
  <span>could his master </span>
  <em>think that—</em>
</p><p>
  <span> “Anakin, </span>
  <em>please.</em>
  <span>” Tears slipped down pale cheeks as Obi-Wan fought to keep his voice steady enough to be understood. “Naboo was difficult enough. And it's </span>
  <em>the </em>
  <span>day.” The word came out a sob. “So if you could please... just </span>
  <em>stop, </em>
  <span>and let me mourn in solitude, I would appreciate it.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>I forgot.</em>
</p><p>
  <span> Shame and horror hit Anakin like a tidal wave. </span>
  <em>He lost both master and sight on this day, and all I could think about was celebrating with my wife, while he sat in that cold reactor room and grieved.</em>
</p><p>
  <em>Dear Force, I'm an asshole.</em>
</p><p>
  <span>Anakin held out the bottle again, allowing Obi-Wan's fingers to close over its neck. “Just a little,” the younger Jedi cautioned. “'Cause we're not done.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span> Obi-Wan's expression froze into a mask of dread, and his definition of </span>
  <em>little </em>
  <span>might have been debatable. Anakin stole the bottle back, took a swig, and settled them both on the floor with their backs to the neatly-made bunk.</span>
</p><p>
  <span> “You weren't trying to make me feel what you felt when Qui-Gon died, then? With the Rako Hardeen—</span>
  <em> thing</em>
  <span>?”<br/>
Obi-Wan scoffed and filched the bottle. As he raised it to his lips he muttered, “I thought you'd be angry. Convince Dooku not to look at the sniper funny. Maybe because of it I'd survive the mission.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>Didn't even cross his mind that </em>
  <span>I </span>
  <em>might be the one to kill “Rako Hardeen.” You just assumed I wouldn't be out for revenge. You assumed I'm better than I am.</em>
</p><p>
  <span>“It felt like my heart was ripped out of my chest,” Anakin said slowly, staring at the opposite wall, “torn in two, and then half thrown just out of reach and the other stuffed back in the wound, and then being told to just keep living.”</span>
</p><p>Obi-Wan nearly dropped the bottle, but Anakin caught it and took advantage of the fact it was in his possession again.</p><p>“I— I don't understand,” Obi-Wan whispered.</p><p>
  <span> “Me refusing to forgive you? That has nothing to do with you running an intricate undercover mission without me. It has everything to do with you gutted me because you don't </span>
  <em>know </em>
  <span>I </span>
  <em>love </em>
  <span>
    <span>you.”</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>
    <span> “I didn't— I never would have— dear </span>
  </span>
  <em>
    <span>Force.</span>
  </em>
  <span>
    <span>” Obi-Wan curled forward, head bowing and tears escaping in a silent stream.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>
    <span> “I know I say you're </span>
  </span>
  <em>
    <span>like </span>
  </em>
  <span>
    <span>my Dad. It's because I was scared to say it out loud. You </span>
  </span>
  <em>
    <span>are </span>
  </em>
  <span>
    <span>my Dad, Obi-Wan. And kark, you're like this other half of me that I can't survive without. And I think you know what it feels like to feel that way about someone.”<br/>
A sob caught in Obi-Wan's throat. “I miss him every </span>
  </span>
  <em>
    <span>day.</span>
  </em>
  <span>
    <span>” And then he was weeping, and Anakin set the bottle on the floor so he could wrap his arms around his master's small, shuddering form.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>
    <span> “I get it,” Anakin rasped. “I get that pain. And I'm sorry you've had to live with it. I would take it from you if I could. I forgive you for what you did. Please, just... </span>
  </span>
  <em>
    <span>know </span>
  </em>
  <span>
    <span>I love you. Please don't ever doubt it again.”</span>
  </span>
</p><p>Obi-Wan keened, not believing it even now, and pulled away, trying to reach for the bottle.</p><p>Anakin gave it a kick which tipped it over, spilling it all over the floor. “We don't need that kark,” he announced. “So I need you to stop drinking and start listening to me.”<br/>
Obi-Wan gusted out a great sigh.</p><p>“As long as I live, you will never be alone.”</p><p>“Then why do I see an endless desert whenever I sleep?”</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>He's been dreaming too? </span>
  </em>
  <span>
    <span>“I see fire. Feel it burning in my bones.”</span>
  </span>
</p><p>Obi-Wan's head turned in his direction, the grim endurance fading a little in concern.</p><p>“I'm not sure we're going to survive this war,” Anakin found himself saying. “The longer we go, the stronger my feeling of dread.”</p><p>Obi-Wan gave a sober nod of agreement.</p><p>
  <span>
    <span> “And maybe— maybe it's okay.”<br/>
Obi-Wan arched an eyebrow at him. “Words I never thought I would hear </span>
  </span>
  <em>
    <span>you</span>
  </em>
  <span>
    <span> say.”</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>
    <span> “I've had a really good life. You </span>
  </span>
  <em>
    <span>gave </span>
  </em>
  <span>
    <span>me a really good life,” Anakin murmured, watching as Obi-Wan's expression turned unsure of himself again. “And hell, if I have to go out earlier than dying of old age, I'd rather go out by your side than anywhere else.”</span>
  </span>
</p><p>Obi-Wan's hand stretched out, searching for his hand. Anakin met it halfway, felt Obi-Wan's fingers squeeze tight around his palm.</p><p>“Meditate with me, Master,” Anakin whispered. “I want to show you what's in my heart.”<br/>
After a moment's hesitation, Obi-Wan nodded.</p><p>Anakin scooted closer to him, and cuddled together, he let his mind relax and his shields drop.</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Never feel unloved again.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <em> Ever.</em>
</p><p>
  <span>
    <span>And Obi-Wan saw.</span>
  </span>
</p><p> </p><p>* * *</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>
    <span> There had been yelling. He couldn't be blamed for healing </span>
  </span>
  <em>
    <span>yelling.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>
    <span>As the General said, he was good at doing his duty. Passing along information vital to his General's well-being was part of that duty.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>
  <span>
    <span> The fact that the entire 212</span>
  </span>
  <sup>
    <span>
      <span>th</span>
    </span>
  </sup>
  <span>
    <span> and 501</span>
  </span>
  <sup>
    <span>
      <span>st</span>
    </span>
  </sup>
  <span>
    <span> now knew their General felt unloved was simply a matter of efficiency.</span>
  </span>
</p><p>Oh, and the Commander knew too.</p><p>It had been late before Skywalker left Kenobi's room, whispering, “He's asleep.”</p><p>Rex nodded, slipping silently into the room and over to his bunk. Across the room he could see Obi-Wan slumped on his own bed, hair pulled back in a loose, messy tail, his body slack with exhaustion.</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>How do we make sure you feel loved?</span>
