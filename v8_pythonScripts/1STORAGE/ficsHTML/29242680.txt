          <div class="userstuff"><p>Shang Qinghua had never really tried to change anything. For all he lived in this new cultivation world of ‘Proud Immortal Demon Way’ since a baby, he had never dared to mess with the setting or plot. He didn’t do any of the regular transmigrator things to try and profit from his modern-day knowledge. Any changes he made could potentially ripple through the timeline and throw off the story, thereby rendering his future knowledge useless.</p><p> </p><p>It didn’t mean he hadn’t thought about it, however. When he was too small to do much else, he thought. As soon as he could write, he copied down any information he could remember from the old world. He did not write things about the plot or setting or characters of the book he was now living in, he was its creator, and whatever he forgot, the system was happy to remind him. No, what he recorded was the miracles of the modern world, the music, the technology, the dance, the fashion, the food, the stories. He didn’t want to forget where he came from.</p><p> </p><p>With that knowledge he refused to forget, he tried to privately recreate them. He had shelves and shelves of scrolls full of the inventions and designs he had recreated but refused to release into the world. It was a bit of a hobby for him, in between the crushing workload of An Ding Peak and Mobei-jun’s requests.</p><p> </p><p>By the time Cucumber-bro transmigrated into Shen QingQiu’s body, Shang Qinghua had long left his reinventions to gather dust in a corner of his office years ago. The new reminder of his old world, and their weekly tea meeting to bemoan the things they missed, struck a spark of motivation in him. With a second pair of eyes, some of those remade inventions might see the light of day now.</p><p> </p><p>He might not muster the energy to recreate his own fan or air conditioning, but with Cucumber-bro’s incessant nagging, it suddenly became top priority.  </p><p> </p><p>Together they went through all those old scrolls of inventions to drag their modernness into reality. Shang Qinghua could freely admit that he would have never gotten the guts to do it before. Even if they couldn’t make the inventions widely known, Shen Qingqiu still insisted on air conditioning and running water and a water heater and other amenities in his house.</p><p> </p><p>Surprisingly, even without a steady supply of metal for their home-grown industrialization, spiritual energy made do. It barely took a month before they were sitting atop two highly magical houses that had multiple modern amenities and some even greater ones that even the modern times couldn’t do.</p><p> </p><p>Shang Qinghua wished he had gone back to his younger self and slapped him with a ‘Bitch you live like this?’ to really get the point across at how stupid his suffering was.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Shang QingHua was strange, he had always been considered so from the days he was a hapless disciple on An Ding peak. He always muttered under his breath about things no one understood, sang strange songs and made strange contraptions that baffled others. His master always privately thought that the boy should have gone to a peak that deal with artifacts or spell creation instead.</p><p> </p><p>But in the end, no one could deny that he was good at logistics. He had organized the peak within an inch of its life, laid down processes and a messaging system so that everything flowed with little fuss and minimal effort from him. An Dings was no longer the ‘Ant’s peak’ where everyone rushed around in panic trying to get everything done on time. Instead, everyone moved with calm purpose, knowing what had to be done and where it needed to be delivered. An Ding had never been so efficient in its entire existence. There were spreadsheets and tables and <em>schedules</em>.</p><p> </p><p>Even if he had been a writer rather than a businessman in a corporation, Airplaine Shooting Towards The Sky knew enough about modern organization from his school days to make the workflow much easier than it used to be. Perhaps, <em>because</em> he was a writer, he knew about organization so well. Though he had never been accused of being a tidy and organized writer, some sort of planning had been involved. That planning and worldbuilding just never had the chance to be published because his readers cared more about the papapa.</p><p> </p><p>Shang Qinghua just wanted to be lazy.</p><p> </p><p>He didn’t want to have to organize every little thing for an entire sect, far less for when he would also have to deal with Mobei-jun’s business as well in the future. He didn’t like working so hard dammit! He wanted to laze around and read and cultivate too, you know! He didn’t want to spend his immortal body hunched over a desk doing accounts!</p><p> </p><p>So, he schemed and plotted and tore down the age-old traditional organization methods in favour of simpler, quicker ones. Why fill out five forms when two would do? Of course, there were problems, methods that didn’t translate well to the time period and those that were not actually suited to the tasks. But he could smugly boast that five years into his Peak Lord tenure, he had half the work to do of his predecessor. Ah, the wonders of delegation!</p><p> </p><p>His disciples thought Shang Qinghua to be the sort of eccentric mad genius that was better to just leave be. He had strange turns of phrase and even madder ideas, but their peak had never been better. The disciples had never been so satisfied with their work or so motivated in their lives.   </p><p> </p><p>Much less when he made some sort of printing contraption that allowed them to replicate books in large batches at a time. The peaks had never had such full libraries. The Sect had never had such full coffers. The poor disciples who had to painstakingly copy books day in and day out, outright wept for joy. More disciples took up writing original works to make some pocket change. And Shang Qinghua was privately thrilled that he was starting to acquire a small library of trashy novels once again.</p><p> </p><p>(Getting together with Shen Qingqiu in their bookclub of terrible literature was surprisingly fun. Listening to Cucumber-bro roast books was fun when your book wasn’t the one being roasted.)</p><p> </p><p>With his free time, Shang Qinghua set out to make himself a nest worthy of any proud shut-in.</p><p> </p><p>(Much later, Cucumber-bro would be so impressed, he started to make his own)</p><p> </p><p>First, he cleared out all the clutter from the Peak Lord’s official residence. It wasn’t a big place, it barely had three rooms, and it wasn’t elaborate. Much like the rest of the peak, it was built for pure function and little else. It was a simple little house that was sequestered away from the hustle and bustle of the peak activities. Even though it was the designated Peak residence, it wasn’t uncommon for the An Ding peak lord to nearly always sleep in the Main Logistics building instead to save time and let them work longer.</p><p> </p><p>Shang Qinghua wasn’t having this, he needed some space away from that stress pit, a clear line between work and home. Besides, he had worked so hard for those 5 years so that he wouldn’t have to work so hard later. Once he got his transport arrays to work, he would have to work even less!</p><p> </p><p>He gutted the house, throwing out nearly everything. All old files went to storage, all old furniture was repurposed elsewhere, everything that could be reused was moved elsewhere. In his last life, he had been poor, barely scraping by on scraps and pennies and whoring out his writing and story to make something that would sell, rather that what he wanted to write. In this life he had resources enough to truly make himself a home for however long it would take before he was murdered by his favourite character.</p><p> </p><p>In the end, it was nothing opulent. Just dozens of bookshelves with his trashy library, a small room for his experiments, a porch where he could hang a hammock and a really nice bed that he could stuff with comfy blankets and pillows. With a space of his own, he could finally have a place to relax and be himself. He could finally swap the elaborate robes of a peak lord, though An Ding had a far less complicated set than the others, for something more relaxing.</p><p> </p><p>(The disciples of An Ding quickly learned to knock before entering their Shizun’s house after one of them walked in on him with his hair scandalously loose and dressed in his under robe and little else)</p><p> </p><p>Using the basics he knew from sewing and cheaply bought cloth, he made rough versions of modern-day clothes. When he was finally satisfied, he bought some high-quality cloth and made better versions of his lounge clothes. This world sorely lacked short pants, vests or anything that revealed even the slightest sliver of skin and sometimes he just wanted to feel a nice breeze on his skin, okay?!</p><p> </p><p>What Shang Qinghua didn’t realize was this.</p><p> </p><p>In his old world, he had been nothing special. He was neither ugly nor pretty but was instead, painfully average. In this new world, with much less mirrors and chances to view himself, he had taken a few glances at his mother’s mirror before he left home to decide that he was once again, painfully average. Why would the rat spy of a stallion novel have a face that was anything special? He was only going to die like the rat he was, there was no need to waste a good face on him.</p><p> </p><p>It also didn’t help that every single Peak Lord was drop dead gorgeous. Each good-looking in their own way, from Shen Qingqiu’s grace and elegance to Yue Qingyuan’s wholesome classically handsome face to Liu Qingge’s devastating beauty. Even the Peak Lord of the monk peak with his bald head was handsome in his own way. Shang Qinghua just viewed himself as the odd man out, someone so devastatingly plain that he looked positively ugly next to his overwhelmingly good-looking disciple siblings.</p><p> </p><p>What Shang Qinghua didn’t realize was this.</p><p> </p><p>No matter how plain a person started, the cultivation process left them as some manner of gorgeous the more powerful they got. It wasn’t that only gorgeous people became Peak Lords, it was that the people who were strong enough to become Peak Lords inevitably became gorgeous.</p><p> </p><p>In fact, Shang Qinghua was considered to be quite attractive by the disciples. He wasn’t as unreachable and aloof as some of the other Peak Lords. He was down to earth and practical but kind to a fault. Even his flaws were easier to stomach than some of the other Peak Lords, Shen Qingqiu’s acerbic tongue or Liu Qingge’s legendary lack of social skills. Sure, Shang Qinghua was a bit eccentric and prone to cowering, but when he needed to, he stepped up to support the peak. In fact, his bursts of courage were more impressive knowing how much the man was afraid of conflict.</p><p> </p><p>Aside from his qualities, Shang Qinghua’s attractiveness came from the fact he was….well, cute.</p><p> </p><p>He was the shortest peak lord, even shorter than the women, with a slender and frail frame. Even Shen Qingqiu and Qi Qingqi had more muscles than him from their combat training. But to be quite honest, An Ding Peak had less combat training and more speed training and how-to-flee-for-your-life training then anything offensive. Shang Qinghua mainly got by with the speed of his sword and his tricks when he needed to leave the peak at all.</p><p> </p><p>It was easy to forget that he was a peak lord, that he had a very high cultivation level and a powerful golden core, when he was so tiny and nonthreatening. It gave a person a thrill to loom over a powerful peak lord and make the man crane his neck up to reveal the pale milk skin of his throat. He had the demeanor of a kicked puppy or a fluffy hamster, with large, doe-like eyes that teared up endearingly and pouty cheeks. Something about his face made you want to pinch his cheeks and feed him more…or bully him relentlessly.</p><p> </p><p>Of course, his tendency to be bullied and look very good when crying attracted a lot of men and women who wanted to be the one to drive the small peak lord to tears.</p><p> </p><p>Thankfully his peaks siblings preferred to be the only ones allowed to bully him and ruthless drove off anyone else that came sniffing about their clueless An Ding Peak Lord.</p><p> </p><p>And this was when he was at work.</p><p> </p><p>Relaxed and lounging in a hammock, he became an entirely different creature entirely. His constant jittery anxiety soothed with relaxation. He made little nests of pillows and blankets and sprawled and ate little fruits. He even enchanted a fan to keep breeze flowing when it was hot. For all the vaunted immortal body was supposed to keep Shang Qinghua from sweating like a pig in a blanket, it didn’t stop the pervasive  <em>s w e a l t e r i n g</em>  desert heat. It just stopped his body from reacting to it. Which was somehow worse.</p><p> </p><p>Shang Qinghua could complain about the multiple layered Xanxia-fashioned robes he had to wear, but every time he opened his mouth, he got a flashback to the one time he complained to cucumber-bro and got the most vitriolic rant he had even heard from the man. He may be suffering under layers, but Shen Qingqiu had it worse. That grace and elegance that he cultivated, that distant beauty…..was achieved by no less than six layers of robes. SIX. <em>At least</em>. Shen Qingqiu had told hm about it in vivid, cursing, detail. He solely regretted asking afterward why the man didn’t just leave off a few layers. After all he personally got by in only three.</p><p> </p><p>Underrobe.</p><p> </p><p>First layer.</p><p> </p><p>Outer layer.</p><p> </p><p>Nice and simple.</p><p> </p><p>He had instead received another rant about OOC punishment and relentless mocking of the original good’s overly complicated fashion and dedication to his image. Eventually Cucumber-bro had stumbled to a halt looking very thoughtful in a worrying way.</p><p> </p><p>(Later on, he would regret how those words led to Shen Qingqiu’s habit of stripping in private.)</p><p> </p><p>(Not really)</p><p> </p><p>(A seduced Binghe meant that his bro wasn’t made into a human stick after all)</p><p> </p><p>To be fair, the other peak lords wore more layers than him. He was in charge of An Ding peak after all, the peak who were essentially janitors. Any clothes that was finer and complicated had no place there. Something he kinda mourned about. He wanted to wear fancy soft robes too, Cucumber-bro! This was peak discrimination!</p><p> </p><p>And then the sweltering summer hit and he immediately changed his tune.</p><p> </p><p>Wasn’t he so lucky to be at the peak with the least amount of layers?!?</p><p> </p><p>He sent a package of frozen cucumbers to Qing Jing peak and received back a scroll with the most elegant ‘Fuck you’ he had ever seen, written in fine calligraphy. A little doodle in the corner showed an airplane on fire. He wisely decided to stay away from Qing Jing for the next month.</p><p> </p><p>It was surprising with his regular state of disreputable dress, but it took nearly five years for Mobei-jun to walk in on him.</p></div>
