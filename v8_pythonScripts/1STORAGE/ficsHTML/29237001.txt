    <p>Mrs. Marston was one of Jason’s favorite teachers, despite being maligned by the rest of his grade. Well, maybe it actually had something to do with that. Most of the kids in Jason’s grade were assholes. Or idiots. Or both.</p><p>Mrs. Marston was serious and maybe a little stern, but she was one of the only teachers Jason had met at Gotham academy who didn’t baby him like he was a dumb poor kid who couldn’t possibly be at their level. Or like the <em>other </em>half who watched him constantly like they were waiting for him to snatch the pencil sharpener right off the wall. Mrs. Marston treated him like all the other kids. Like he was smart, and capable, and no more likely to be a <em>thief </em>than anyone else in the class.</p><p>She was also his English teacher, and it just so happened it was his favorite subject. He’d told her once, after she’d handed him back an essay with a note at the top about an upcoming contest. It was her favorite subject too; no surprise there but you could tell, especially, when she talked about books.</p><p>Which was why Jason read most of her recommendations and why, when she told them about an author’s upcoming book signing at a local bookstore, he knew exactly what series they wrote. And he was, maybe, just maybe, a fan.</p><p>“Does anyone think they would be interested in attending?” she asked, holding up a brightly colored flyer in front of the class. </p><p>A few kids raised their hands along with Jason but most stayed silent, slouched back into their desk chairs, not even paying attention. Jason was interested, very interested, right up until she announced to the class, “The tickets are $20 each, but you can purchase at the event. Just be prepared to buy them if you’re not going with a parent or guardian.”  </p><p>Jason’s raised hand slowly lowered to his desk, a disappointed well opening up in the base of his stomach as she went about handing off the few requested flyers. He shook his head, dismissing the idea. He wasn’t gonna ask Bruce to buy tickets to this thing.</p><p>He’d only been living there for three months and it’d been...really good, if he was being honest, and he didn’t want to rock the boat by asking for things he didn’t need. He’d just started going out as Robin and that was way more important than going to see this lady talk about her books.</p><p>When Mrs. Marston walked down his aisle she paused at the edge of his desk but continued on when he didn’t look up, playing the part of every other dejected preteen in the room. </p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p>“Jason, will you stay back for a moment?” she said, just as he was slinging his bag over his shoulder to head to his next class.</p><p>Of course, Mrs. Marston was smart, and she’d spotted his raised hand before he dropped it, and didn’t let him escape with no word. </p><p>He hesitated, glancing at the clock and reluctantly shuffling to her desk. She held up a flyer as soon as he stopped and Jason stared. </p><p>“Uh, thanks but...” Except he didn’t really know where he was going with the sentence and swallowed as his words awkwardly dried up.</p><p>She eyed him for a moment before continuing, “I think you might really be interested in this one. There’s rumor she’s planning to announce the next in the series. You should go.” She held it out further, to the point it would feel rude if Jason didn’t take it.</p><p>And maybe his stomach did a little flip flop at the idea of being there for that. Gotham seemed like a weird place to do it, he had no idea why someone would plan that but...no harm in at least taking the flyer he figured, even if he had no plans on going. Jason glanced at the clock, grabbing it quickly to stuff in his backpack before he was late to his next class. </p><p>It rolled around in his head for the rest of the school day, the idea of going. But his mouth went dry every time he thought about asking. He could sneak in, probably, if he wanted. But no, getting caught at that would be way worse than just asking to go. It wasn’t like he needed to. He wanted to obviously but he’d learned the difference between the two a long time ago. </p><p>Bruce had made a big deal about providing him the necessities when he first moved in. Most of them already weren’t necessities in Jason’s mind. </p><p>He looked down at his tennis shoes, the freshly minted black sneakers they had gotten to replace his old ones, thought about the new cell phone in his back pocket ‘for emergencies’, the new laptop sitting on his desk at home, all the new clothes stuffing his closet....he wasn’t about to ask for anything that didn’t make Bruce’s list.</p><p>And it was fine, whatever. Who cared if the author revealed her new series? Jason would still get to read it when it came out. He headed to the pick up zone in front of the school and tried to just forget about it.</p><p>It was easy enough. Stuff like book signings hadn’t even been an option when he was a kid, even if he didn’t have to pay for it; he would have needed to either be home with his mom or trying to find a way to make money. Just like all the other people in his neighborhood still were. It was no great sacrifice to miss it. </p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p>Jason didn’t even think about it after that. Not until a few days later when he was looking through his backpack for a math assignment. </p><p>He knew it was in there, even if he had to dig for it. When he finally did find it he was cursing himself for how wrinkled it was when he pulled it out of the bag. He knew he should be better about keeping them in their assigned folders but it was hard to keep up to speed some days, rushing between classes. Jason wasn’t used to middle school, hell he hadn’t even been to elementary school in over a year before Bruce took him in. But he always found himself scrambling between classes, terrified of being late and having to sit in the back. </p><p>It wasn’t that the <em>bad</em> kids sat in the back — like, <em>yeah right.</em> The bad kids at this school were the ones whose parents paid off their teachers for good grades; they barely knew what it meant. It was because all of them were slackers and they talked through the whole class. At least in the front row Jason could ignore them and pay attention. </p><p>They might not need good grades but <em>Jason</em> did. And anyway it was mostly fine, since he usually took the same seat in each class the other kids usually left it open, naturally gravitating toward their own sections.</p><p>He admitted it would probably be ok to let himself slow down a little though, as he attempted to uncrumple his math homework. It was even folded around another sheet of paper he realized, carefully disentangling them only to discover the forgotten flyer for the book signing. </p><p>He stared at it for a moment, the brief desire and stifled disappointment reasserting themselves at the reminder. Glancing at the date he realized it was supposed to happen the very next night. Jason had even been going through the last published book in the series just a couple days before, looking for clues of what happened to one of the characters. He wondered if she’d talk about it at all. </p><p>Smoothing the flyer out on his desk he eyed the ticket prices, pencil in one hand, ready for his math homework. It was $20 each. So if Bruce thought someone should go with him, which, he probably would because he was paranoid in the weirdest ways sometimes. Not like Jason hadn’t lived on his own for a whole year before. But whatever, the total would be $40, which was a lot even before tax. And after...He scratched out the math on the side of the flyer - they’d been learning that sort of thing in math, multiplying decimals and shit - it came to $43.40.</p><p>The number made his stomach twist. He knew, logically speaking, that it was nothing to someone like Bruce Wayne who dropped like $100 on a t-shirt. Maybe even more than that. But to Jason...that was two weeks worth of groceries for him and his mom if he played it right. </p><p>Would he have given up two weeks worth of food to go see this thing? Even a few days?</p><p>No, no he definitely wouldn’t. It wasn’t important, and it certainly wasn’t necessary. Kids back in his old neighborhood would never even have heard about this. The teachers wouldn’t have told ‘em, ‘cause they’d know nobody could afford it. </p><p>Oh well, Jason thought as he doodled a little star and pentagon on the corner of the page that the main character wore on a necklace.</p><p> The other kids would just think he was a nerd for going anyway. He sighed when he was done, tapping his pencil to the page.</p><p>It was disappointing, maybe, but at least he had things like missed book signings to be disappointed about now, instead of staring at the inside of an empty dumpster and wondering where his next meal might come from. No question, this was way better.</p><p>Without another thought he stuffed the flyer into the trashcan under his desk and smoothed out his homework to start on. </p><p> </p><p> </p><p align="center">*</p><p> </p><p>Jason was in charge of cleaning his own room. It was part of his deal with Bruce when he very first moved in. Jason cleaned his room and nobody else ever stepped inside it unless Jason invited them, or it was an emergency. What kind of emergency Bruce expected him to have in his bedroom was beyond him and the qualifier had left him suspicious for months, but so far, no one had crossed that boundary without his express permission. He was beginning to figure it was just another paranoid Batman thing. </p><p>But, while Jason cleaned his own room, Alfred still preferred to take out the trash on a set schedule and didn’t like Jason leaving his until it was full before he emptied it. So every Friday morning he’d set his little trashcan outside his bedroom door and when Alfred went to clean up after Bruce and do whatever other tidying he did in the other, empty, rooms he’d clear up Jason’s trash with it. Jason figured he didn’t mind walking his little plastic bin down to the kitchen to empty it there instead but Alfred insisted. He had a certain way of things or whatever, Jason wasn’t gonna argue. </p><p>So far it made things easier for him anyway and it had yet to bite him in the ass. Until now.</p><p>It was dinner time and when Jason came to the table he spotted a familiar piece of crumpled paper sitting innocuously next to Bruce’s elbow, where he already sat waiting. That was unusual in itself but seeing the paper that he clearly recognized by the brightly colored display made him instantly on edge. </p><p>Bruce smiled when he saw him, the forced kind that always made Jason wary, slowing his steps to the table. Willis used to look at him like that when he wanted something out of him. He <em>hated</em> playing lookout for his dad.</p><p>But Willis wasn’t his dad anymore, he reminded himself, taking the seat diagonal from Bruce. </p><p>“How was school?” He asked, not acknowledging the flyer at all while Alfred started bringing things to the table. </p><p>“Fine,” he answered back, not in the mood to be led around to whatever he apparently did wrong. </p><p>“Nothing new or interesting this time?” </p><p>Alfred set a glass of water in front of his plate and Jason took the distraction to thank him, offering only a shrug back to Bruce as the butler vanished back into the kitchen. Jason could only see blankness in his expression; good or bad, he didn’t know. </p><p>“Your classes are all still going well?”</p><p>Jason reached forward to serve himself, frowning. “Why?”</p><p>Bruce hesitated, one hand hovering above his fork but not quite picking it up. “Because...” he started, seeming even a little confused by the question, “I’d like to know if you’re having any trouble. So we can help, if you need it.”</p><p>Jason dropped the serving spoon back in the dish with a clatter and grit his teeth, “I’m not stupid.”</p><p>Bruce froze, a look of pure bafflement crossing his face. “I never said you were.”</p><p>“I already did all your tutoring sessions and shit, I’m caught up, I’m fine,” Jason spoke to the serving dish in the center of the table, scowling at it. He didn’t know what this had to do with the flyer, Bruce asked him all the time how his classes were going and maybe Jason was making it into more than it was but it always grated. Like they expected him to always need help, like he couldn’t figure it out on his own. </p><p>“I know that...” Bruce said slowly, eyeing him a little more intensely now, like he was looking for something. “Every kid needs help with their homework sometimes,” he finally concluded, staring at Jason for an extended moment before he nodded to himself and reached for his own food, like the situation was resolved. </p><p>Jason shuffled broccoli around his plate and scowled harder, waiting for the other shoe to drop. </p><p>Willis never beat around the bush when he was mad, but Jason had known plenty of people who did. There was an old pimp in his neighborhood that the girls had hated. He’d come around acting happy to see them, and that was always when you knew he was mad. </p><p>But now, as Jason waited for Bruce to just get on with it — he started asking what he wanted to do over the weekend, like all was fine and dandy. “I don’t mind if you stay out later tonight, if you’d like, since there’s no school tomorrow, but only an hour or so, I don’t want your sleep schedule to get too far off.”</p><p>Jason nodded, watching him, eyes flicking to the flyer still as Bruce Just... made small talk.</p><p>But Jason couldn’t seem to stop looking at the forgotten paper, gaze darting back and forth and barely listening enough to offer responses until the roiling in his gut finally erupted and he cut through Bruce’s next sentence like he hadn’t been speaking.</p><p>“Can you just tell me why I’m in trouble for throwing away a stupid flyer?” </p><p>Bruce stopped mid word, closing his mouth slowly, expression as hard to read as it ever was. “You’re not in trouble,” he said, tone level.</p><p>Jason leaned over his plate, elbows digging into the wood of the table like he knew Alfred hated. “Then why did Alfred pull it out of my trash? Better yet why are you going through my trash? What do you think I’m hiding, huh?”</p><p>A stupid, overly confrontational question that left him red in the face and tight in the chest. It wasn’t that there weren’t things Jason was hiding. There was a well stocked stash of non-perishable foods in a spare backpack stuffed in the attic that spoke for itself but Bruce didn’t need to know about that. </p><p>The man leveled him with a look, a blank, but serious expression that never failed to make Jason quail despite his best efforts. He ducked his head, feeling his ears go pink as he pushed his food around his plate, not feeling hungry in the least. Embarrassed and not even knowing why.</p><p>But not knowing what this was about made his stomach roll. He didn’t need this beating-around-the-bush bullshit. If Bruce was gonna punish him or scold him or whatever, he just wanted to get it over with.</p><p>He reminded himself that Bruce wasn’t like his dad; punishments in the manor so far were things like an early bedtime and doing the dishes, maybe being benched for the night. But it had only been a few months, and Bruce was still so damn unreadable. Jason wasn’t betting on anything yet. </p><p>He wished he could just figure this place out, and Bruce too. He used to do plenty himself that was now suddenly off limits, things he’d get in trouble for, or receive disappointed looks over or, sometimes worse, <i>shock</i>, like Bruce couldn’t believe he was dumb enough to think this very-normal-thing was ok.</p><p>The first time he’d walked the mile down the road to the bus stop and took a ride into the city Bruce had nearly had a heart attack, acting like he’d scared him on purpose or something. Not like he didn’t go literally everywhere by himself before. </p><p>He understood, afterwards, that he probably should’ve told one of them where he was going at least, but being banned from traveling by himself at all was not what he’d expected. Nor was having a cell phone forced on him so they could reach him if he wasn’t with them. They insisted their travel ban wasn’t a punishment, that it would have been a rule either way, they just hadn’t realized they needed to voice it.</p><p>Well, sorry for being independent, Jason had wanted to spit. </p><p>It chafed a little, the new restrictions, just another thing Jason didn’t get. But it was a whole lot better than before. He could put up with it; he just wished he could figure out where the lines were when it felt like they’d been completely redrawn as soon as he moved in here. It felt like he was doing something wrong around every turn.</p><p>Jason heard Bruce let out a soft breath through his nose and the crinkle of paper as he picked up the flyer.</p><p>“No one was going through your trash. It was on the top and when Alfred went to dump it out he happened to notice it.”</p><p>Jason leaned back in his chair, letting himself slump down in the seat. He wanted to accuse him of lying but as far as he could tell Alfred wasn’t much of a liar. At least, not to the family. And there were only a few things in his garbage...</p><p>“So what about it then?” He grumbled, digging his fingernail into a chip in the finish at the edge of the table, not looking up.</p><p>Bruce was quiet and Jason tried to sneak a glance at him through the corner of his eye. He was staring at the paper, a frown on his face, before he set it back down and said, “You know you can always ask me if you want something, Jay.”</p><p>He scoffed without really meaning to and then immediately clamped his mouth shut. Stupid. So stupid. When he chanced a look up, the frown had spread to include a deep wrinkle between his eyebrows.</p><p>“I’m serious. I’m not saying I’ll always say yes, but I’d never be upset that you asked. If you’d told me in time, I would have taken you.” He had a hand resting flat on the paper, but he was looking right at Jason.</p><p>He turned his attention back to his half eaten meal, uncomfortable without totally knowing why. It was weird when Bruce said shit like that, he didn’t make <em>sense </em>and Jason never knew how to respond.</p><p>And something about it twisted in his gut. It had only been the night before. They’d only missed it by a day. </p><p>“It’s fine, who says I even wanted to go?” Jason shrugged, stuffing a piece of chicken in his mouth even though he didn’t want it. He wasn’t gonna waste food. </p><p>But of course, then Bruce looked all disappointed for some reason and Lord, Jason didn’t understand him and his weird, micro-expressions and he hated that <i>that</i> one was so easy to read. Why did they care if he had wanted to go? Shouldn’t they be happy he didn’t bug them with all his shit all the time?</p><p>“You calculated the sales tax to the tickets, Jay,” Bruce said quietly, almost gentle and Jason bristled. “You don’t need to worry about the price of things anymore-“</p><p>“It was just f-riggin’ math practice, Bruce, jeez. We’re doing decimals.”</p><p>The frown didn’t leave. “Jay-</p><p>
  <i>“What?”</i>
</p><p>He didn’t know why he was suddenly angry, or upset, or whatever, but he could feel the heat of it in his stomach, sour and stinging. He just wanted to stop <em>talking</em> about it. </p><p>There was a tick in Bruce’s jaw that made him sink a little further in his seat, a wary caution quickly extinguishing the heat. But his voice was still level when he next spoke.</p><p>“You’re allowed to want things. Even things you don’t need.”</p><p>Jason scoffed, even while he felt his face go scarlet, stomach flipping unexpectedly. But still, he rolled his eyes. It didn’t matter.</p><p>“If I thought something was too expensive I would say so, but that is not part of the decision that you need to make.”</p><p>“I get it, you’re rich. We all know.” Jason grouched, wondering, fleetingly, where Alfred was when you needed him.</p><p>“Jason-“</p><p>“Bruce, it’s fine. I told you,” he did his best to sound nonchalant, leaning forward again to take a bite of the dinner he didn’t want, just to prove how much he didn’t care. “It’s not a big deal, it was folded up in my math homework, I was just practicing. I really didn’t care.”</p><p>Even though he couldn’t hide the little doodle of the star and pentagon symbol. Jason had talked about the series before and it was one of those things Bruce would probably remember because he was friggin’ Batman. When Jason looked back up he seemed unconvinced, lips a flat line. He still nodded though, turning his attention back to his food.</p><p>“Alright. As long as you know, if something like this comes up in the future, I’d like to know. It would be fun to take you.”</p><p>Jason tried not to make a face but wasn’t entirely sure he succeeded. “Yeah, ok.” He somehow doubted it. He didn’t see what could be fun about it for Bruce, but he wasn’t gonna argue that one.</p><p>Finally Bruce slid the flyer to the side, and didn’t look at it again.</p><p>But Jason - he couldn’t seem to ignore it after that. There was a twinge of disappointment that he hadn’t just said something when he still could have. They could’ve gone, if something didn’t come up. </p><p>Jason knew that kind of thing happened. Willis sometimes used to say he’d take him out for burgers and then he’d end up not showing, come home late ‘cause somebody offered him a ‘job’ or something, legal or otherwise. </p><p>It was better that he didn’t say anything.</p><p>Even with Bruce’s assurance that he wanted to know about this sort of thing Jason just felt like...<em>sure</em> he was allowed to want things, everybody was, but that didn’t mean they got to have them all.</p><p>Patrol was extended, like Bruce said, and it was nice, <em>fun </em>even. Jason loved being Robin, but he also felt a lot more tired than usual when he came back to the cave. As he struggled out of his uniform and trudged to the showers he wasn’t entirely sure it was from staying up late. Some things just felt heavy, even when you knew they were the right thing.</p><p>Bruce didn’t get it. He’d grown up with everything. He didn’t know what his money actually meant, what it was really worth. Jason did, and however the man wanted to waste it, Jason wasn’t going to. He’d already been spirited away to a mansion on a hill and was living his stupid fairy tale life, complete with secret identities. There were plenty of people still living with just as little as he used to. Jason wasn’t about to ask for more. </p>
