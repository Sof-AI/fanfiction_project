    <blockquote class="userstuff">
      <p>There are likely several unspoken rules being broken with this one—a multi-chapter first fanfic, no beta read, and an original character! While the new guy is important to the story, I promise he's mostly a plot device to explore Shang Qinghua and Mobei Jun's relationship. Some misunderstandings, some mutual pining, some fluff? Read to find out! Multiple chapters are already written, so updates will be regular for a little while until I catch up. Tags, and possibly rating, will be updated as relevant. Enjoy!</p>

    <p>
  <span>The week of the Demonic Alliance Conference had finally arrived.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Preparations had been ruthless</span>
  <span>—</span>
  <span>countless hours over untold months shaving years off his life. Shang Qinghua was eager for the relief that would follow it finally being over. One more week and he could dive into his bed, curl up with his latest manuscript, and flip the bird at anyone who dared ask him to do otherwise.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s been a couple years since the Demon Realm’s Northern Territories had become Shang Qinghua’s full-time home. While he still returned to Cang Qiong Mountain upon occasion, the purpose was now almost entirely sentimental and the time spent brief. He was proud to see how well his Head Disciple had kept the place running in his absence, and looked back at his days as An Ding Peak Lord with awe, fondness, and a shit ton of stress. It was good to only be overseeing the ins-and-outs of one organizationally stunted society for once, especially when events like these were suddenly dropped in his lap.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was a shame that the Demonic Alliance Conference wouldn’t be nearly as exciting as its namesake though. Anyone who had attended previous Immortal Alliance Conferences left with at least half a dozen good stories to tell. Yet despite the fact that this current event was almost exclusively attended by demons, there would be no competitions, no hunts, and no fights. At least not scheduled ones. The purpose of this gathering was to foster alliances with the smaller clans from across the Demon Realm, those whose stature and power was too lowly to earn them a place at more exclusive gatherings.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In short, there would be lots of boring, repetitive, snarl-infused meetings.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In hindsight, the name choice was rather stupid, but as Shang Qinghua was the only one who thought there was a point to naming a span of time in the first place, it didn’t seem important to dwell.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The location was Mobei Jun’s palace, there in the frozen tundras of the North, and would take place over two weeks. For those two weeks, the palace would serve as a temporary home to dozens of delegates made up from all manner of demonic subspecies, at least the sentient ones. Shang Qinghua swore his sides still hurt from the day he tried to explain the distinction to Mobei Jun. Demons who could manage speech were hard enough to reason with, you want to try and discuss treaties and dues with creatures whose entire existence is just to eat and f***? His King had stoically questioned if there was any difference, and Shang Qinghua laughed for a solid five minutes. Do you think anyone else knew Mobei Jun was so funny?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mobei Jun, the overseer of the North, second in command to the great Luo Binghe who held dominion over the entire Demon Realm. Mobei Jun, the one Shang Qinghua had long ago sworn to serve. Mobei Jun, the most perfect man or demon alive in this world, all chiseled muscle and icy stares. It was an irrefutable fact. Shang Qinghua made him that way afterall.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It was day two of the Demonic Alliance Conference.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Now late in the afternoon, the largest of today’s assemblies was wrapping up. Shang Qinghua had been allowed to skip most of this one. Mobei Jun had been insistent that his services would not be required. He knew that meant it would be more posturing than discussion, an extended meet-and-greet where everyone would grandstand and flaunt themselves before more meaningful conversations could occur the next day. Or there were individuals there who couldn’t resist a walking human nugget. Whatever. He welcomed the exclusion. Afterall, with so many strangers now staying in the palace, there was no shortage of disasters to manage.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Everyone had to have their needs met, and it was of the utmost importance who was placed in what room, in what wing, and by what other clan. Don’t even ask about the eating arrangements. Or how important it was to ensure their individual cultures weren’t disrespected in a manner that would throw everything into chaos over the tiniest perceived slight. Even the scheduling of meetings had to be meticulously overseen to ensure the smoothest possible results. Information and decisions from one gathering had to be collected and presented to the next and given due process by all parties involved when they were all second guessing each other’s motives with the scrutiny of ten generations worth of paranoia. And of course they couldn’t all just meet at once.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>In short, these demons were a bunch of immature children, too pissy to get along with one another without kicking up fits and arguing over who’s toy belongs where. More than a few refused to be in the same room together, but insisted on their inclusion all the same. It was enough to drive anyone crazy. Naturally it fell under the broadstoke of responsibilities for Shang Qinghua, the one saddled with keeping the palace running smoothly. Playing nanny to all these grown-ass demons, like toddlers fighting for the role of parent’s favorite in hopes of getting an extra cookie with dessert. What about Airplane Shooting Towards the Sky? Was he not their true parent? Why not come grovel at </span>
  <em>
    <span>his</span>
  </em>
  <span> feet for a change?!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shang Qinghua sighed, wiping his hand on the front of his robes to remove any remaining traces of dust and ink from a morning of toil. He had been summoned to the great hall by his King, no doubt to present the arrangements made for the days to follow. A few scrolls were gripped under his arm, containing his notes on the delegates in attendance and a meticulously rendered schedule that would in all likelihood be rendered moot by whatever went wrong first.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Such is (his) life.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Two servants parted the way as he came up to the large double doors that separated the palace’s south wing corridor from the great hall. Inside was a congregation of some of the Demon Realm’s most eclectic individuals. He pushed the doors open himself and made his way in with all the nonchalance of someone who had done it dozens of times before. This group was nothing compared to the war councils that saw the likes of Luo Binghe and his generals in attendance. He barely broke a sweat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Shang Qinghua, stand at my side.” Mobei Jun ordered without pause, as if the whole room had been waiting for him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes, my King.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shang Qinghua walked forward and dutifully stood next to Mobei Jun as instructed. He took a moment to scan the room. Most there were faces and names he’d already learned, but there were still some he hadn’t seen before. He felt the twinge of an oncoming headache just thinking of all the memorization still left to do. Why couldn’t every clan send just </span>
  <em>
    <span>one</span>
  </em>
  <span> delegate? Things were so much easier when this information was all coming from inside his head.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It didn’t take long for him to become keenly aware that most eyes in the room were on him. A dozen individuals seated around a table headed by their sovereign, and </span>
  <em>
    <span>Shang Qinghua </span>
  </em>
  <span>was the most interesting thing in the room? They were acting like they’d never seen their King’s advisor before, as if the very sight of him doing anything other than taking notes suddenly removed some veil of invisibility. If he hadn’t checked before entering, he’d think his robes were inside out. Did he smell? Or maybe they were just hungry. Shang Qinghua crinkled his nose. But seriously, shouldn’t they be paying better attention to their King while he spoke? Demon priorities really were a mess. If he ever had a chance to rewrite them, he’d make so many changes, not least of which being</span>
  <span>—</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <span>—</span>
  <span>this King’s betrothed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Huh?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>The cultivator turned his head as his eyes snapped to Mobei Jun, where a pair of brilliant blue eyes were waiting to meet him. The murmurs of the hall’s occupants barely registered as background static, buried under the thrumming of his own heartbeat. Who was his King’s betrothed?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mobei Jun stared back as if waiting for something. Shang Qinghua was too stunned to even consider what it could be. His handsome King didn’t seem unprepared for this result. In fact, what could almost be perceived as the beginnings of a smile flickered at the corner of his lips before he turned back to face the crowd.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“As such, this one expects that his royal consort will be treated with all deference befitting one of his position.” His demeanor showed no change, but the air around them felt like it lowered a degree. Shang Qinghua suppressed the urge to shiver. “Any actions in opposition to this would be taken as defiance against this Mobei Jun and all whom he governs and allies with. Shang Qinghua’s needs and wants are his, one and the same.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Apparently Shang Qinghua was the King’s betrothed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The room went silent in unchallenged recognition, and it didn’t take long for the tittering of excitement to fill the palace as word spread.</span>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>-------------------------------------</b>
</p><p>
  <span>“You could have given me some warning, my King!” Shang Qinghua wailed as the two made their way towards the royal bed chambers. Mobei Jun looked over to him, questioningly.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Our relationship has been very clear.” His eyes narrowed. “Does the matter of being wed to me displease you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What? No, my King, that’s not it,” Shang Qinghua felt his cheeks warm under the pressure, his attempt at holding a frown failing. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Isn’t the problem obvious?!</span>
  </em>
  <span> “I meant warning me you were going to just announce it like that.” His lips tightened in a pout as his gaze fell, along with the volume of his voice. “It wasn’t exactly a very romantic way to propose……”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It still didn’t feel that long ago that the two of them had been awkwardly straddling the line between master and servant, and...whatever they were now. Labels are weird. And hard. Regardless, Shang Qinghua would never forget those long, confusing months of “courting”, where apparently he had been flawlessly following the very playbook he’d offered to Luo Binghe on how to win over another man (as a kindness to his bro, Shen Qingqiu, btw). Pathetic, sticky, protectable. In response to his “advances” Mobei Jun had started sending him gifts like only a demon could. The smell of an especially rancid kill still lingered in his old room back on An Ding Peak. Why couldn’t his King have just stuck to his frequently failed, and hopelessly endearing, attempts at making noodles?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Still, the first time that Mobei Jun had told him he was cute</span>
  <span>—</span>
  <span>even though they were his own words repeated back to him</span>
  <span>—</span>
  <span>Shang Qinghua had nearly died on the spot. He never thought he’d be the blushing maiden type, but in the hands of Mobei Jun, his heart was putty. The powers of lead characters should never be underestimated!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And, yes, Mobei Jun was a lead character, okay?! The story and the readers just didn’t know it, but the author did! Even if he did kill him off...and then considered doing it again with a rock. Life was funny that way.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>These days Shang Qinghua had no doubts as to what they were to each other, labels aside. His promise to serve Mobei Jun forever with unwavering loyalty had not diminished, and in fact only extended further to matters of both his heart and body. Mobei Jun had offered the same in return. It was all a little embarrassing!! Once the two began sleeping together</span>
  <span>—</span>
  <span>both varieties, your mind may stay in the gutter</span>
  <span>—</span>
  <span>Shang Qinghua’s small servants’ quarters in the palace became nothing more than an inconvenient pit stop because he’d always end up in Mobei Jun’s bed. So, as a matter of efficiency befitting someone from Logistics, his meager belongings and personal writing desk had been moved to Mobei Jun’s more than large enough chambers.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Marriage however, was something they hadn’t talked about. Not really. Not that Shang Qinghua remembers. He had thought about it though, sort of. Mobei Jun had never married before, and as King, whispers in the palace expected him to take a wife and produce an heir. It wasn’t as if Shang Qinghua could pop out any mini-Mobeis so the formality of marriage seemed kind of pointless, and he definitely didn’t have any interest in being “Queen”</span>
  <span>. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Was that even how it worked?</span>
  </em>
  <span> Details aside, it was obvious now he was the only one who didn’t think it was important.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You were expecting something else?” Mobei Jun asked, pausing to let Shang Qinghua enter their room before him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I don’t know! Maybe.” Shang Qinghua clapped back, a little harsher than he intended as he let the scrolls in his arms tumble to the surface of his desk. “Everyone always wonders how they’re going to be proposed to. It’s not really something you discuss. It’s something that just happens, and</span>
  <em>
    <span> then</span>
  </em>
  <span> you’re supposed to tell other people, and usually that’s friends and family first. I mean, who would that even be for us? Cucumber Bro and Luo Binghe, I guess. My disciples at An Ding Peak. Your Uncle? Blech. Pass. But really who just skips over </span>
  <em>
    <span>the</span>
  </em>
  <span> most important part of the proposal and tells a room of strangers instead? Not that I was expecting some grand gesture like my name spelt in clouds or some stupid fancy restaurant with flowers and a ring or</span>
  <span>—</span>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You wish to have your name in the clouds...?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, my King!” Shang Qinghua cried, rubbing his own face in his hands. “</span>
  <em>
    <span>Ugh,</span>
  </em>
  <span> please just forget I even said anything.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mobei Jun advanced quickly and grabbed his wrist. Shang Qinghua squeaked, old habits dying hard as his nerves turned to jelly. “You </span>
  <em>
    <span>are</span>
  </em>
  <span> displeased,” he glowered. Shang Qinghua flinched.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>...</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How would humans have done it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Mobei Jun did not repeat himself, but did release his grip.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh. Well, uh...ah...lots of different ways, I think. Depends on the person, er, people, really. You see...” Shang Qinghua started, rubbing at his wrist. “Something like</span>
  <span>—” and</span>
  <span> the floodgates opened, releasing a veritable feast of ideas ranging from proposals he’d seen in movies and TV, to plots he’d used in his original draft of </span>
  <em>
    <span>Proud Immortal Demon’s Way</span>
  </em>
  <span>. He babbled as Mobei Jun watched on in silence, swallowed up in his own colorful narratives as he recounted examples that left him sighing, groaning, and laughing incredulously. Who cares if he didn’t get some cheesy, romantic proposal? That’s not how most humans did things in this world, anyway, let alone demons! It was stupid to even think about. Can you imagine Mobei Jun doing any of those things? Shang Qinghua couldn’t. Nope. Couldn’t imagine a single one, and they definitely didn’t leave a little ache in his heart.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He may’ve given this more thought than he realized.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Oh well.</span>
  </em>
</p><p align="center">
  <b>-------------------------------------</b>
</p><p>
  <span>That evening there was a large banquet. It was the first time that all representatives had been invited to attend a single event at once, and surprisingly most seemed willing to attend. Many long tables had been fitted into the great hall, covered in all manner of substances to consume. Subjectively one might call it food. Shang Qinghua typically would not. Yet while the smell of the room’s curated assortment of rotted meats threatened to curl the ends of his hair, the sight of the room overall was amazing to behold.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There were dozens of demons in the room. The variety in their appearance made for an impressive display, so much so that Shang Qinghua hardly knew where to safely settle his eyes. It was times like these where he truly felt humbled as an author. Though he’d written more words than he could ever recall about this world, there were limits to what he described and holes that were filled without his input. It was moments like this where he really felt a sense of appreciation for how vast this world was, and how many things were left for him to experience. As much security in his own story gave him, he couldn’t deny the thrill that came from feeling like he’d stepped into somebody else’s.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Across the assortment of demonic subspecies, there were horns of all shapes and sizes, with skin colors across the spectrum, and every manner of scale shape and model-worthy bone structure one could imagine. Fangs and fur stood out from outfits of leather and fabric, some covered head to toe, and others barely dressed enough for public viewing, by human standards here anyway. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Was that an ankle showing?! Scandalous!</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>It was impressive how few design choices had been reused, and not everyone had strictly humanoid body shapes either. One table housed a trio that looked like someone had scaled down dragons just enough that they could reasonably fit in a pair of pants, while another group forgoed use of any chairs as their snake-tail bottoms trailed sinuously across the floor. They admittedly looked a bit more familiar than most.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Despite some nasty stares and the occasional jeer, everyone seemed to be getting along rather well. The alcohol flowed freely—the effects of which were debatable, but still enjoyed—and it was obvious that nothing that wasn’t locked down would be wasted.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shang Qinghua sat in a chair next to his King, pleased at the arrangement that saw their table much more accommodating to his palate. Less raw meat, and even some vegetation. Hail to the Kings of old that dating one didn’t mean he had to eat like one. Those were days better left in the past. Cultivation did about as much for food poisoning as it did for horniness, which in this world was absolutely nothing (and way fewer potential perks).</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The joy of edible food was wasted on Shang Qinghua however. It wasn’t like he had any time to eat it. Every few minutes another unfamiliar face would come over and introduce themselves like this was some sort of impromptu job interview. He wasn’t sure if they were trying to suck up or strong-arm half the time. It was probably both. Mobei Jun didn’t seem to care</span>
  <span>, a fact he </span>
  <span>made abundantly clear by not being bothered to even spare most of them a look. It left Shang Qinghua to take the brunt</span>
  <span>—</span>
  <span>nodding his head to each one, feigning a smile, locking away their details in his mind, and cursing himself for not grabbing a snack beforehand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lord Shang Qinghua,” a soft voice cut through the chatter. He looked up to see a delegate he recognized from a similar looking group near the back—pale-skinned and lithe, with long golden hair held back by a series of intricate braids and strikingly bright purple eyes. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Neat! </span>
  </em>
  <span>What really stood out though was that this demon was the first one to address Shang Qinghua directly. Everyone else introduced themselves to Mobei Jun, with varying degrees of upset when “the human” was the one who reciprocated.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shang Qinghua nodded his head in acknowledgement, earning a smile in return.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Qu Shiying comes to pay respects to the Lords of this castle. It is a great honor to have this one’s clan invited.” The demon steepled his fingers together near his chin and bowed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Mobei Jun and this one accept your respects and welcome you,” Shang Qinghua recited, a tad less dry than the last dozen times. Something about the guy struck him as quite friendly, probably the lack of utter disdain for talking to a human. That was nice. Something about him seemed familiar though. “Sorry if this is rude, but what territory do you come from again?” Shang Qinghua asked. A prickle on the back of his neck indicated Mobei Jun had glanced his way, likely a reminder that his humility was unnecessary, and probably offensive to him by proxy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Qu Shiying” did not seem deterred. “This one comes from the East, one of the valleys at the base of Zi Jing Mountain. It is unlikely his Lordship has been, but could be assured of a very warm welcome should he grace us with his company.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Ah...is this what respect feels like? The author would like seconds of this dish, please! </span>
  </em>
  <span>As for the answer, it sounded about as vaguely familiar as the character’s name. Like so many things, it sat in a corner of his brain under a layer of dust, there but untouched for so long that it’d take some digging to get to.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Maybe I’ll visit someday. I have heard many things about the herbs that grow around Zi Jing Mountain. Not many places grow</span>
  <em>
    <span> anything </span>
  </em>
  <span>in the Demon Realm, and definitely not around here,” Shang Qinghua replied in earnest.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This one imagines Lord Shang Qinghua will not have much time to himself should the wedding plans begin. There has been much talk about it being a grand affair.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Funny how it’s the first I’ve heard of it! </span>
  </em>
  <span>Shang Qinghua hid a small cough in his hand.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The delegate continued. “The timing of this assembly feels very propitious, to come before such grand affairs. Such an important time, to allow those such as this one and his kin to share a table with others of similar minds and seek such opportunity. It is truly an honor indeed.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Somebody’s had good results so far, </span>
  </em>
  <span>Shang Qinghua had to assume as the other bid him a courteous farewell.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Over the next few hours, Shang Qinghua lost track of how many pleasantries he had to dish out to considerably less kind visitors. At some point Mobei Jun became involved enough to snarl at anyone who came close, finally allowing time to eat. Shang Qinghua helped himself to anything that still looked chewable when cold, followed by a few small cups of some sharp tasting wine that left a pleasant burning sensation in his stomach. He really hoped it was wine anyway. It was a 50/50 shot drinking any liquid served at a demonic banquet that wasn’t clearly identifiable as water, and even then… Shang Qinghua grimaced at the memories.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Eventually things started getting a bit too rowdy for his taste, as many of the demons caught their second wind after digesting and the nocturnal among them caught their first. It was already getting rather late, so Shang Qinghua excused himself. Mobei Jun looked positively pouty about it (by his standards), required, by the few in the room who could still make their lives difficult, to stay longer for some sort of something involving the heart and lower shanks of a monster Shang Qinghua couldn’t identify.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shang Qinghua resisted the urge to stick his tongue out at him smugly, if only because of what that might accidentally communicate to the room. He didn’t want to chance being pulled into the middle of a fight. Or an orgy. Or a plate, for that matter. Better to leave with his faculties and limbs intact and call the whole thing a success.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Making his way out of the great hall and down into the adjacent corridor, he realized how warm the room had been with all those bodies and torch fire. Outside was positively chilly. His poor King must be so uncomfortable in there. He felt a little bad, just a tiny bit, but not enough to go back. Taking a moment to tighten shut his robes as he walked, Shang Qinghua found himself facing a hallway he didn’t expect. It wasn’t one unfamiliar to him, just not the shortest route back to his room.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>I guess that really was wine</span>
  </em>
  <span>, he thought to himself, both grateful and annoyed. He did feel a little bit tipsy actually. Maybe. Just a little. Mostly sleepy. Turning around to reorient himself, he was confronted by the sight of someone several meters back in the direction he’d come from.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Qu Shiying was there, alone as he had been when they’d met at the banquet. The demon made eye contact and bowed from the flickering shadows.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Lord Shang Qinghua, this one bids you a more personal welcome. How fortunate we were able to meet like this.” He said with the same smile as before. With both of them standing in the open hallway, Shang Qinghua could get a better sense of him</span>
  <span>—</span>
  <span>notably that he was probably about a head taller than Shang Qinghua, though so thin he likely weighed the same, probability of super dense demon bones aside. His gray, well-fitted robes were surprisingly thin for someone from Zi Jing Mountain, which he was sure was a warmer climate compared to the snowy North.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Are you lost?” Shang Qinghua asked, still walking towards him. As he neared, Qu Shiying turned to join his stride until the pair were walking side by side.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hmm, yes and no.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>…</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Well, which is it?</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Shang Qinghua glanced at him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This one could have been considered lost in that he didn’t know where Lord Shang Qinghua had gone, though as his intent was to speak with the human Lord, it must be said that he has in fact found himself where he wished to be.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>After a few moments to register, Shang Qinghua finally looked dumbfounded. “You were looking for </span>
  <em>
    <span>me?</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The other simply nodded.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shang Qinghua groaned, a string of curse words just barely held at bay. “Okay, okay...ah...how to say this… There’s nothing I can do for you. If you have grievances or requests, you need to take them up with everybody else during the meetings. I can’t just talk one on one with anybody who happens to find me, and unless you want your breakfast order changed, there’s nothing else I can do.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>When no immediate response came, he looked to Qu Shiying directly, who was simply staring back at him, arms behind his back, and that airy smile never leaving his face. His golden eyelashes caught the torch light and almost seemed to sparkle this close up. Shang Qinghua couldn’t help but think how much better dark lashes over firm brows looked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>…</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Okay...?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“This one was waiting for the Lord to finish speaking. He wouldn’t dare interrupt.”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Respect again! Too weird.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Qu Shiying suddenly stopped walking, and without thinking, Shang Qinghua did as well.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Although, this one does wish to speak and clear up possible misunderstandings, before Lord Shang Qinghua comes to any wrong conclusions of this one’s intent for being here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shang Qinghua chose to play the fool and recycled the tactic of staring back. Something about this was starting to feel...off.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Qu Shiying steepled his hands near his face again, his faintly clawed fingertips lightly touching his own lips as they had in the great hall before. He bowed once more. His pupils shone like amethyst in the flickering lights as he met Shang Qinghua’s gaze.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Qu Shiying of Zi Jing Mountain wishes to formally court the Lord Shang Qinghua. This one believes he is the most suitable mate for one such as himself, and has come to the Northern territories with intent to persuade.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Everything in Shang Qinghua froze.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>No, seriously, even his heart likely stopped beating. Then suddenly like a machine revving back to life, all he could hear was the pounding of his own heart as blood raced from his face. Or was it </span>
  <em>
    <span>to</span>
  </em>
  <span> his face? Simultaneously blanching to the point of wanting to faint, and blushing in confused embarrassment, had left him dizzy. Or it was the wine. Whatever it was, he was definitely standing there too long doing nothing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then Shang Qinghua laughed. “I don’t think I heard you right. You want...to </span>
  <em>
    <span>court</span>
  </em>
  <span> me? Like, me, right here, this one?” He pointed at himself.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Even though I’m, uh…” Saying it out loud the first time was unexpectedly hard. “...engaged to Mobei Jun?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes.” Qu Shiying’s smile brightened, as if proud of the little human cultivator.’ Look at him, connecting the dots. So cute’, he’s probably thinking.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Nothing here was cute!!</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Wait, was he technically being proposed to twice in one day? And worst of all this guy was kinda, sorta doing a better job at it. </span>
  <em>
    <span>In some people’s opinion, were you to ask</span>
  </em>
  <span>, he thought. Probably.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shang Qinghua was struck with the nostalgic urge to just roll back his eyes and play dead. He barely swallowed the temptation. Demons weren’t as easy to fool as the likes of his fellow Peak Lords had been, nor was the stupidity of making himself prone in front of someone who just made some very specific intentions known lost on him. Bad idea.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You...can’t be serious,” Shang Qinghua found himself laughing again, though considerably more nervous. Was he being pranked? Cameras don’t exist in this world but that didn’t stop him from expecting them to pop out of the ceiling. Wait...what if this was a test? Did Mobei Jun not trust him and wanted to see how he’d respond to somebody else? Was a decade of servitude and years of papapa not enough?! Or maybe this was some kind of scheme by others in the Mobei Clan. They were definitely mad about the whole engagement thing. Were they trying to get Shang Qinghua out of the way? When did straight-up murder fall out of fashion? That would be so much simpler to deal with!!!</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Qu Shiying seemed to be looking him over, then gave a little nod as if agreeing to something.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The evening is late, and this one understands the many duties that Lord Shang Qinghua has in hand. Perhaps this is a conversation best saved for a future encounter.” He gently placed a hand on Shang Qinghua’s shoulder as he went to pass, and gave it a little squeeze.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shang Qinghua jolted, as if suddenly waking up. He went to smack the hand away but only hit air.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Forward much?!</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Qu Shiying’s looked no less pleased as he took back his hand and bid a polite farewell, making his way back towards the distant bustle of the banquet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Shang Qinghua was stunned, watching the retreating figure as a cocktail of emotions flooded his mind.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then he really did faint.</span>
