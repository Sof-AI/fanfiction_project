    <p>It’s only because of Savage that Feral has even managed to survive this long as a Sith apprentice, so maybe it’s entirely unsurprising that his first mission alone is going to end like this.</p><p>Jedi. Not just <em>a</em> Jedi, or even just a Jedi Master, but a member of the High Council. The member, after Obi-Wan Kenobi, who makes Maul curse most viciously, too, and if <em>Maul</em> isn't strong enough to beat him, Feral has absolutely no chance.</p><p>Tucked back against the stones of the cliff, Feral eyes the group of transports, the clones, the Jedi Master, and then the distance to the tower he’s supposed to be infiltrating. Mother Talzin and Maul seem to have mostly given up on sending him against armies the way they do Savage, but getting past defenses is something Feral’s good at. He’d thought to prove it, this time, going in alone even though Savage doesn’t like him taking missions while he and Maul are elsewhere. But—</p><p>Nothing in the intelligence Mother Talzin gave him mentioned Jedi, and certainly not the 104<sup>th </sup>Battalion and their general.</p><p>Quiet, careful, Feral slips down the face of the cliff, his dusty coloring cover enough in the settling dusk. Savage would rush right in, and Maul would stage his entrance for the most dramatic moment and then slaughter everyone, but—Feral won't manage that. There's no need to kill the troopers, either; what Feral needs are the transmission codes in the broadcasting station beyond them. If he can get past them in the darkness, there should be plenty of time to get through the tower and to the control room before they notice that something’s happened.</p><p>The Jedi will be the biggest problem. Feral has no quarrel with Jedi, for the most part; one of them tried to kill Maul, and nearly did, and that puts Feral’s hackles up, but—</p><p>He’s not a good Sith. Even after a year with Maul seeing to his training, and Savage helping at every turn, Feral’s still the one who needs to be protected, guided, kept aside while his brothers rush into battle. He doesn’t feel the same anger, has trouble hating. Even Jedi, who it should be easy to loathe.</p><p>A loose stone rattles away from Feral’s boot, skids across the lip of rock and clatters down the side of the cliff, and Feral swallows a curse. With a flicker of power, he leaps up, as quick as he can move, and leaps across the gap into the branches of the closest tree. Tucks himself tight against the trunk in the midst of draping moss, then freezes there, waiting.</p><p>There's silence, long, tense, and then a curt, “Comet, Boost, check it out,” that carries clearly.</p><p>This, at least, Feral has faith he can manage. Hiding from Brother Viscus and the other Nightbrothers as a child was good training, and he stays perfectly still and silent as the pair of clone troopers pass beneath him, the floodlights on their helmets casting wide beams of light across the forest floor.</p><p>“Think the commander’s getting jumpy?” one clone asks, joking, and the other snorts.</p><p>“You going to tell him that?” he asks dryly. “Anything?”</p><p>“Not that I'm seeing.” The lights sweep up, but Feral doesn’t move, hardly breathes as they sweep across his hiding place. There's one moment when he thinks the fall of his robes is going to give him away, that the trooper has noticed—</p><p>“Your side?” the clone asks, and his lights fall back to the forest floor.</p><p>“Lots of rocks,” the first says, mildly disgusted. “I bet they slide all the time. If Wolffe has us jumping at every shift, this is going to be a karking long deployment.”</p><p>“Better than being stuck with the 212<sup>th</sup> for a month,” is the second’s verdict. It makes the first laugh in clear agreement, and they keep walking, sweeping the perimeter as they go.</p><p>Slow, careful, Feral breathes out, then drops lightly to the ground. Remembers Savage’s words in the Nightbrother camp, so long ago—<em>Feral, try not to draw attention to yourself</em>—and smiles a little wryly. <em>That won't be a problem for me</em>, he’d answered, and—it’s still true enough. Simple not to be seen. Simple to slip by unnoticed.</p><p>He isn't sure what Mother Talzin was hoping for when she saved him. Likely something more than this, though. It wasn’t sentiment, Feral is sure of that. After all, the fact that she birthed the three of them hasn’t ever seemed to matter to her before. But—she wanted usefulness, likely.</p><p>Feral’s proved far less useful than she’s hoped. Not a good Sith, not a fearsome warrior forged by Nightsister magicks, just a connection to a past she wants Savage to have abandoned. Savage is in control of himself now, though. There's no easy way to make him kill Feral again, and some of the old protectiveness is still there. He won't let Feral die, either. So Mother Talzin is stuck with him for now. Except—</p><p>Well. Savage and Maul are across the galaxy, working with Ventress. When Mother Talzin brough Feral the information on the broadcasting station, he hadn’t thought to hesitate. Now, though, it’s looking rather more like a plot to get him killed than a mission for the sake of the Separatists.</p><p>Perhaps, Feral thinks grimly, he miscalculated her ruthlessness. A mistake he won't make again, if he survives this.</p><p>Careful of each step, he slips through the trees, skirting around the quiet voices of the clones as they head back towards the transports. In the cleared space around the tower, there’s tech set up, a rough camp, and the Jedi and a clone in grey-and-blue marked armor and grey-striped <em>kama</em> are leaning over a display that shows a map of the area. Feral isn't close enough to see any details, and he won't risk getting any nearer with a Jedi Master right there, but he frowns a little. Maps probably mean some sort of operation, and Feral didn’t seen anything about that in Mother Talzin’s information.</p><p>There's very little chance it was just a mistake or an oversight, and Feral grimaces, turning his eyes towards the tower again. He’ll have to be more careful from now on, or stick closer to Savage and Maul. It will annoy Maul, who has little patience for weakness, but—</p><p>But Feral survived Savage breaking his neck. He’s not about to lie down and die because Mother Talzin is frustrated that he isn't like his brothers. Not after everything.</p><p>Even if the mission is little more than an elaborate murder attempt, failure will still mean punishment. More than would otherwise be warranted, likely—Mother Talzin will be annoyed he survived. Knowledge of that keeps Feral cautious as he skirts the tower from the edge of the forest, looking for a way in. There are squads of clones on guard, all of them alert, and Feral can sense movement within the tower’s walls as well. The odds aren’t good, not without Maul or Savage here as a distraction, and as he completes the first circuit Feral comes to a stop, crouching behind the cover of a fallen tree and eyeing the wall.</p><p>If he has to fight his way in, with so many clone troopers <em>and</em> Jedi Master Plo Koon here, the attempt will be over <em>very</em> quickly. Even causing a distraction likely won't split their forces enough for him to manage an infiltration, and Feral rubs a hand over his horns, trying to think. Trying to imagine what Maul would do, but—</p><p>Maul has never been weak. Maul wouldn’t have needed Savage to protect him from Ventress, to give himself up to Ventress to save him. He wouldn’t hesitate to do what he needed to now, either.</p><p>And then, in the distance, the sound of blaster fire rattles to life.</p><p>Feral freezes, listening. Not within the camp, but beyond it, past the next ring of trees. It sounds like an attack, and within moments the relative calm of the camp is gone. Clones grab weapons, jerk their helmets on, and run, and the Jedi straightens from his plans. At his side, the commander growls orders into a comm, then turns and says something, and the general chuckles. He cocks his head, offering something in return, and a moment later they’re moving, disappearing into the trees at a quick pace. Feral watches them go, then slips in the opposite direction, towards the rear of the tower.</p><p>The clones there haven’t moved, haven’t relaxed. Feral takes one look at their bristling weapons, then the wall behind them, and grimaces. If those are droid armies attacking, though, that means Count Dooku has some hand in this, and if Feral can make them <em>assume</em> he’s one of Dooku's many apprentices, they might underestimate him. Dooku's training is nothing compared to Maul’s, after all, and for all of Maul’s disdain he’s at least made sure that Feral can hold his own against clones and battle droids. For Savage’s sake, Feral knows, but—he still appreciates it.</p><p>Drawing his hood up to cover his face and hide his horns, Feral shifts back, judging distances. Too far to leap, even with the Force—the ring of cleared ground means he’ll have to expose himself at least briefly to the clones on guard, and to the tower’s weapons systems as well. Blaster bolts Feral can block, but the cannons will be far more of a problem.</p><p>Still. At the very least the Jedi is otherwise occupied, and that means Feral won't have a better opportunity to break in. He thinks, briefly, of trying to send a message to Savage, just in case, but stops himself before he can even start to reach for his comm. Maul is gathering power, and Savage is with him. They won't have time to answer their comms, and if they do, they won't be impressed by Feral’s plight. It’s a simple mission, after all.</p><p>If Feral was half the Sith they are, he’d have no trouble.</p><p>With a grimace, Feral pulls the scarf up over the bottom half of his face, hiding his coloring; if anyone gets close enough, they’ll know he’s a Zabrak, but this at least will confuse people from a distance, will add to the possibility that he’s Dooku's newest apprentice. Dooku hasn’t taken on another Zabrak since Savage betrayed him for Maul, and given his feud with Mother Talzin he probably won't, but very few other people will know that.</p><p>Mother Talzin will at least be pleased to have Dooku blamed for this, if he manages it.</p><p>Carefully, Feral unclips the lightsaber from his belt, weighs it in his hand for a moment. Then, deliberate, he steps out of the trees.</p><p>One of the clones notices him immediately, and shouts. Blasters come up, and Feral controls the instinctive twitch, the urge to dive to the side and out of the way. Like facing Ventress in the arena, knowing what was coming, and he still hates it. But this time, at least, he’s steadier. He doesn’t have to watch friends die at the hands of a Nightsister, doesn’t have to watch his brother give himself up in Feral’s name. The stakes are low; even if he fails, it will be fine.</p><p>With a hissing crackle, the scarlet blade ignites, and Feral can feel the fear that surges, the way the clone looks at him and sees death but still doesn’t move. Stands there, braced with the others, blaster lifted.</p><p>“Halt,” he says, and his voice doesn’t even shake.</p><p>Feral looks past him, to the antenna array that emerges from the top of the tower. With the codes, Mother Talzin and Maul will be able to listen in on every transmission the Republic sends, scramble messages, wreak havoc on their systems. He just needs to get to the control room and steal the data.</p><p>“Move,” he says, quiet, “and you won't be harmed.”</p><p>The clone doesn’t. Instead, he activates his comm, and says, “Commander Wolffe, General Plo, there's some kind of Sith trying to take the comm tower—aargh!”</p><p>He hits the ground and rolls, thrown by one hard push with the Force, and Feral hurls himself forward. The other clones don’t even hesitate; they open fire, a spray of blue bolts that Feral spins through, deflecting them into the ground and the walls. This, at least, is mindless and simple, almost soothing. He knows how the bolts fly even with his eyes closed, can anticipate, react, counter. Right in the middle of the knot of troopers, he twists to his feet, throws up a hand.</p><p>The Force is always easier to touch when his mind is at peace like this. One moment of will and a wave of it knocks the whole squad down.</p><p>Deactivating his lightsaber, Feral clips it to his belt and leaps the wall, just as another shout rises. There's a squad of troopers at the main door, and they fire immediately, but Feral leaps, flips, falls. The roof of the tower is solid, too thick to cut through, but there's a transparisteel viewscreen right beneath the array, and he leaps lightly across the roof, grabs the edge, and swings down, a blow with the Force shattering the whole window as he drops through. It takes half an instant to find the block of transponders he needs, and Feral makes for them quickly. The whole system is automated, so there shouldn’t—</p><p>There's a light thump of boots behind him, right at the edge of the broken window, and Feral stills.</p><p>“Well now,” a deep, cheerful voice says, and with a hum, a lightsaber ignites. “I don’t believe we’ve been introduced.”</p><p>Something cold slides down Feral’s spine. That was far, far quicker than it should have been unless they were prepared for exactly this sort of attack.</p><p>“Master Koon,” he says, and turns, stepping back. Hears shouts, coming from below, and lets his gaze flicker away from the Kel Dor for an instant. More troopers coming up the tower’s interior. And with Plo blocking the window, that leaves Feral with far fewer escape routes than he would prefer.</p><p>Plo chuckles, taking a step forward. “How polite,” he says. “May I have your name in return, then?” When Feral says nothing, he cocks his head. “Ah, a shame. I'm sure Sinker would like to know the name of the Sith who gave him such a fright.”</p><p>Sinker. Likely the clone who faced him. Feral takes a step back, keeping his distance from Plo, and says, “Your men are still alive.”</p><p>There's a long moment of silence as Plo studies him. “Yes,” he agrees after a long moment, and advances another step. “I'm very grateful for your restraint, though I will admit it’s rather unusual.”</p><p>Feral reaches for anger, for fury, for any of the rage that makes Maul and Savage so fearsome. But—anger never comes easy, and fear is the closest he can get. And after so long, after so many things have fallen apart, even fear is hard to hold onto. Feral’s already died once, after all. He doesn’t want to do it again, but—it’s hard to fear something he’s endured already, or at least to fear it so deeply that it becomes the source of a Sith's power.</p><p>Besides, Savage has found a place for himself, in large part because of Feral’s death. He loves Maul, loves having a brother to fight alongside him, to be his equal. Feral has tried to feel jealousy, greed, but—he’s mostly just <em>glad</em>. Savage would have died for him, <em>did</em> give up all claim to his own being for Feral’s sake.</p><p>Feral would do practically anything to keep him from having to make the same decision again.</p><p>“Don’t you have other things to be focusing on, Jedi?” he asks, and retreats another step. The lift is behind him, and if he can get the doors open, the shaft is a decent enough escape route.</p><p>With a light hum, Plo takes a step, then one to the side, and Feral eyes him. Judges the distance to the lift and the way he’s being herded, then the possibility of defeating one of the most dangerous Jedi in the whole Order, and wants to curse.</p><p>Plo doesn’t waver. “Well,” he says. “Grievous certainly wants us to think so, but I believe Master Ti is keeping him <em>thoroughly</em> occupied at the moment. And we received information that someone would be attacking the communications array, so I volunteered to stop them. I must say, I expected commando droids, not one of Dooku's new assassins.”</p><p>Grievous. Of course Mother Talzin would send him into the middle of one of Grievous’s campaigns. There's little doubt that this was an attempt to get rid of him, and Feral closes his eyes for just a moment. Maybe he should have sent that comm to Savage anyway.</p><p>“A shame,” he says. “I was so hoping my presence would be a surprise.”</p><p>Plo laughs. “You are very surprising, assassin,” he assures Feral. “This whole encounter has been quite intriguing.” The blue blade of his lightsaber dips, and he offers Feral one four-fingered hand, claws politely capped. “Give yourself up, and this will go far better for you.”</p><p>Feral takes another deliberate step back, hand going to his lightsaber. Doesn’t want to ignite it, or duel Plo, because there's no way he’ll win, but—</p><p>“If the surprise is ruined, I should return and let my master prepare another,” he says. Sees the shift of Plo's weight, and in an instant he flings out a hand, all of his will behind one hard push.</p><p>The wave of force hits Plo squarely, flings him back through the open window and out of the tower, and behind Feral there’s a snarl. He ducks just in time, a blaster bolt skimming his ear, and twists, Force-quick, to lash out with a foot. The clone commander goes down, but even as he falls he aims and fires, and Feral flicks the bolt aside with a twitch of his fingers, leaps up and over, and drops down right between two more troopers as they emerge from the lift. The ones from the forest, he realizes with a start, and drops, sliding between them. Hits the edge of the lift, then flips his lightsaber out, ignites it, and drives the blade into the floor of the lift. It sears through easily, and Feral deflects a spray of blaster bolts, then kicks out the cut piece and drops.</p><p>A grapple fires, and a body falls after him.</p><p>Alarmed, Feral twists, catches a half-second glimpse of the commander raising his blaster, and throws up a hand. The cable jerks, and fear snaps through the clone, metallic and unpleasant on the back of Feral’s tongue. He catches a mental image of a broken cable, an unstoppable fall with no Jedi general to catch him—</p><p>Feral lands, rolls, and comes to his feet, slicing through the doors with one swift slash and leaping out. He can feel the Jedi at the top of the tower, more clone troopers closing, the commander landing, and he spins, leaps for the main doors of the tower and out.</p><p>There's a blaster waiting for him, and Sinker on the other side of it.</p><p>Feral freezes. Maybe it’s knowing the clone’s name that makes him stop short, or maybe it’s that familiar-unfamiliar flare of <em>I might die but I won't let that stop me from saving them</em>. Maybe it’s the fact that there's no way around the clone, no space to leap him. If Feral tries to throw him again, he’ll fire, and deflecting the bolt from this close means it will hit the clone. And—</p><p>Feral could cut him down. But he can see his face through the helmet, knows his name. His fingers tighten on the hilt of his lightsaber, and for a moment all he can think of is Savage stepping in front of him, confronting Ventress to save him. Sinker is doing the same, facing a Sith to save his brothers, even though he’s absolutely sure it will kill him.</p><p>The tip of a blaster settles against the back of his head, and the clone commander growls, “Drop the lightsaber.”</p><p>Feral holds Sinker’s gaze, able to sense the confusion rising, the uncertainty. Raises his hands, slow, careful, and touches the Force as he opens his fingers—</p><p>“Wolffe!” Plo cries, and Feral hurls himself sideways just as the blaster against his head fires. The ‘saber spins as it falls, forcing Sinker back, but Feral doesn’t wait. Leaps, flips, catches the lightsaber as it comes spinning back to his hand, and then turns to the door only to find the commander has planted himself squarely in front of it. He looks <em>furious</em>, but Feral can feel the fear in him, something soul-deep and almost sharp enough to make him falter. It feels—familiar, almost. Like his own fear of Mother Talzin, when he’s standing before her with Savage near him.</p><p>The fear doesn’t stop him, though. In an instant, he’s moving, launching himself forward and right at Feral, and Feral is too startled to do anything for one critical moment. Wolffe hits him around the waist, bears him down to the floor and slams him into the plating, but Feral grew up wrestling with Savage even if he never won. Wolffe is half Savage’s weight, and with a hard twist Feral gets a knee in his chest, takes a punch to the face that would have likely broken a Human’s jaw, and flips them. Catches Wolffe’s fist, then rolls off of him as he brings up a knee to catch Feral in the stomach. Spinning to his feet, he throws up a hand, catching the flash-bang grenade just as it leaves Wolffe’s fingers and sending it towards the Jedi as he approaches at a run.</p><p>The click is warning enough to shut his eyes, duck his head and pull his hood down to block the tremendous flash of light, and Zabrak eyes work best in the dark anyway. With the suns setting, with everyone else blinded by the flare, he deactivates his lightsaber and leaps for the door—</p><p>A body hits his back, and Wolffe tackles him down the steps, sending them rolling across the dusty ground. Feral hisses, struggles up, then twists hard, contorting himself. Both of his boots catch Wolffe in the chestplate of his armor, flinging him off, but he grabs Feral’s arm, wrenches Feral around with him and slams him down into the dirt. It knocks the breath from Feral’s lungs, but he shoves a hand up, concentrates, and lets one hard Force push hurl Wolffe off of him.</p><p>Another flicker of power catches Wolffe. It drops him right on his feet three meters away, and Feral scrambles upright, igniting his lightsaber just in time to catch a blue blade across his own.</p><p>“You're a slippery one,” Plo says cheerfully, like he’s hardly straining, even as Feral staggers back a step under the pressure of his blade. “Good at hand to hand, to face off with Wolffe, though. He’s one of the best in the GAR, did you know that?”</p><p>“General,” Wolffe says, aggrieved, and takes two steps to the side, blaster aimed at Feral’s head. “Pay <em>attention</em>.”</p><p>“I am, I am, Commander,” Plo says, entirely unconcerned. It feels like he’s smiling, though Feral can't see it behind his breathing mask. “Now, assassin, perhaps it would be best to surrender. There will be more Jedi here shortly.”</p><p>Feral breathes in, breathes out. Flicks a glance away from Plo, even as he takes another step back, and his ship is at the top of the cliff, hidden but accessible. If he can just get over the wall, back into the trees, he can make it there, get back to Dathomir. Mother Talzin will punish him for failing, but that’s better than dying at a Jedi's hands.</p><p>Of course, that means first getting past Plo Koon, who even Dooku hesitates to engage.</p><p>“More Jedi won't make a difference,” he says. “You can't stop me.”</p><p>Plo chuckles. “Well,” he says, “it seems to have worked well enough so far. Aayla and her men are nearly here.”</p><p>Feral tenses, almost looks for the approaching forces, but remembers himself in time. It’s not a good idea to take his eyes off one of the best swordsmen in the Jedi Order. “It won't matter,” he says again, and really, truly hopes it won't. Once he’s in the trees, he’s confident he can get away, but…there are several hundred yards, a Jedi, and a lot of clone troopers between him and the forest. Maul would—</p><p>But he’s not Maul.</p><p>Taking a breath, Feral meets Plo's covered eyes. Tries to think of something suitably dramatic that one of Dooku's assassins would say, but that just makes him think of Ventress and he refuses to make any part of himself like her, even to fool others.</p><p>Instead of saying anything at all, Feral moves. Sudden, quick, he ducks and spins to the side, Plo's blade missing his horns by a centimeter as it sweeps down. Lunging forward, he slams a shoulder into Plo's side, ducks the lightsaber’s backwards slash, and leaps. A blaster bolt redirects off his own blade, and he hits the ground right in front of Wolffe, drops, sweeps his feet out from under him. Wolffe’s fury surges as he hits the ground, but so does that rotted-metallic terror, and Feral almost staggers under the sudden force of it. Shakes himself hard, bringing his lightsaber down, and Wolffe recoils but Feral isn't aiming for him. He slashes through the blaster instead, then dodges Plo's advance with a high, twisting leap, lands on the edge of the wall, and slips over.</p><p>A moment later, Plo follows, and Feral hisses a curse but spins to meet him, blue blade striking red. Disengaging, Feral ducks around him, vaults a trooper who tries to grab him and feels a spike of warning in the Force. He throws himself down, rolls beneath the sweep of Plo's blade, and kicks out. Plo hops over it, lands, but Feral surges up to his feet inside his guard and headbutts him square in the chest.</p><p>Between the Jedi's robes and his own hood, there’s no chance of Feral’s small horns actually killing him. But it’s certainly a surprise, and there’s enough force behind it to throw Plo right off his feet. He hits the ground hard, and Feral takes a step back—</p><p>From behind him, there's a shout. Feral spins, automatic, and catches a half-second glimpse of Sinker’s helmet. Then the butt of a blaster slams into the side of his head and sends darkness crashing down.</p>
