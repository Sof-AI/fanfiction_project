              <p>After his mother's death, seventeen-year-old Prince Laurent of Vere is sent to the neighboring kingdom of Akielos to wed the Crown Prince Damianos and forge a bond of peace between the two countries. But his uncle, the Ambassador to Akielos, has other ideas.

      <p>Thank you to everyone who wanted me to write this AU; here it is!</p><p>There are some direct quotes from the Goose Girl novel (which if you have not already read, you should) as this is the exposition and I felt that some things (like the story of the three gifts) would be more useful in their original form.

But there will be fluff and happy times too! </p><p>Thanks for reading, hope you enjoy.<br/>Below is a map to give you a visual reference of where everything is taking place.</p>

</p><p>He was born Laurent Émile Adrien Rabat, Second Prince of Vere, and he did not open his eyes for three days.</p><p>The fretting queen and pacing king sent for the best physicians in the land, and at any one moment several of them could be found gathered around the gilded crib, listening to his breathing and his hummingbird heart, feeling his fierce grip and delicate milk-pale skin. All was sound, they pronounced. But still, his eyes did not open.</p><p>“You are a prince,” his father whispered in his ear. “Open your eyes.”</p><p>The baby cooed in his sleep.</p><p>The Crown Prince Auguste, four and already bursting with the energy and vigor his new brother lacked, draped himself over the edge of the crib and touched the baby’s fine golden hair with chubby, curious fingers. “What’s wrong with him?” he asked, with the innocent ignorance of a child.</p><p>His mother shook her head and shushed him. “Nothing is wrong with him,” she murmured. “Nothing at all.”</p><p>That third night, the queen sent the physicians away. She stayed in the nursery, watching her son dream, a small shifting bundle of blankets. Slowly, after a long time spent thinking, she rose from her chair, and bent over the crib, stroking his cheek. “Do you want me to tell you a story?” she asked. “I will, my little one, if you will listen.” She lifted him up into her arms.</p><p>At dawn, the nurse paused outside the nursery at the sound of the rocking chair creaking and a sweet voice singing about magpies and ravens. She burst in, ready to call the guards, only to see that it was the queen herself singing, and that the baby was looking up at her with wide blue eyes.</p><p>*</p><p>The queen had always been a quiet, private person, preferring to spend much of her time in the palace gardens alone. But as Laurent grew tired of his crib, she began to take her second son with her on clear days, to sit under the blooming cherry and apple trees and take his tiny hand in hers and name all she saw. She told him the names of the trees and the flowers that made him sneeze when she tucked them behind his ear; she told him the fantastical version of Vere’s history; she told him of the kingdom that lay beyond Vere and of the wondrous, dangerous things there.</p><p>And she told him the names of the birds, of the robins and jays and kingfishers and crows that soared above them and chattered noisily in the trees and reeds. “Listen,” she would say, “the dove with the green spot there is looking for twigs to impress his picky mate. And there, that redwing in the rose bush is preparing to migrate south where it is warmer.” And Laurent would tip his head to the side, and listen.</p><p>Laurent began to speak in full sentences at one year.</p><p>The queen tried her best to keep it hidden, but once the words came it was difficult to stop them. Only Auguste was delighted by the little prince’s early speech – Veretians disliked anything out of the ordinary. The king himself was uncomfortable with the servants’ gossip and his own brother’s suggestions that the queen possessed unnatural methods of awakening a child’s words. But at the same time he was stubborn and proud, and liked the idea of having sired such an exceptional learner.</p><p>And learn Laurent did. On rainy or snowy days, his mother taught him the real history of Vere, which was fantastical in its own right. And when he tired of that, she would sing to him, songs of women who rode horses made of shadows, men who turned everything they touched to gold, lands where the sky was the sea and the earth cradled the sun. And Laurent learned the words and sang with her, in the high, sweet voice of a toddler.</p><p>When he was old enough to walk on his own, she took him to the swan pond, which Laurent loved even more than the gardens. He would kneel on the muddy bank and dip his hands into the water, watching minnows swim between his fingers and enticing the birds as big as he was with bits of bread. The swans nibbled on the bread right out of his hand, and he marveled at their long, graceful necks and wide, white wings.</p><p>Whenever he ran out of bread, they would splash and honk before swimming away. Laurent wished they would stay. He told his mother this.</p><p>She gave him a long, thoughtful look. “Perhaps,” she said slowly, “you should tell them that.”</p><p>Laurent’s brow furrowed. He turned back to the swans. “Please stay,” he said, feeling foolish.</p><p>His mother laughed lightly, placing a soft hand on his shoulder. “I don’t think he speaks your language, duckling,” she murmured. She looked at the swan and made a sound, halfway between a honk and a whine, and the swan paused, squawking and paddling back to where Laurent knelt, fluffing its feathers expectantly.</p><p>Laurent’s lips parted. “How…how do I say there is no more bread?”</p><p>His mother made another sound, softer than the first. Laurent repeated it.</p><p>“Like that?”</p><p>“Yes,” his mother said, biting her lip. “Perfect.”</p><p>Laurent made the sound again, and the swan hissed, irritated, and swam off. Laurent smiled at his mother, who was still biting her lip, looking at Laurent as if she had discovered something precious but did not know quite what to do with it.</p><p>“Does that…make you happy?” she asked.</p><p>“Yes,” said Laurent, with childlike certainty.</p><p>His mother hesitated, and then exhaled and pulled him into her lap, gathering him close as she did when she was about to tell a long story. He curled against her chest and listened.</p><p>“The Creator spoke the first word, and all that lived on the earth awoke and stretched and opened their mouths and minds to say the word. Through many patterns of stars, they all spoke to one another, the wind to the hawk, the snail to the stone, the frog to the reeds. But after many turnings and many deaths, the languages were forgotten. Yet the sun still moves up and down, and the stars still shift in the sky, and as long as there are movement and harmony, there are words.”</p><p>Laurent had never heard a story quite like this one. It seemed…bigger. Older. Ancient, even, and terribly important. He resolved never to forget it.</p><p>“Some people are born with the first word of a language resting on their tongue, though it may take some time before they can taste it. There are three kinds, three gifts. Did you know your father and uncle have the first? The gift of people-speaking. Many rulers have it. And people listen to them, and believe them, and love them. It has always been difficult to argue with your father…and even more so with your uncle. His words confuse and muddle and distort until only his truth is the right one. That can be the power of people speaking.”</p><p>His mother sighed. “The first gift has kept our country safe. Rulers like your father have talked us out of war with Akielos and Vask for centuries. It can be powerful and good, and it can also be dangerous.” She stroked her son’s yellow hair and chuckled. “Unfortunately, I was not born with that gift.”</p><p>Laurent hummed and leaned into her hand. “Do I have it, Mother?”</p><p>Her lips tightened, just for a second. “I don’t know,” she admitted. <em>I hope not,</em> she thought.</p><p>“If I was not born with it, can it be taught?” Laurent pressed. “Could I learn how to people-speak?”</p><p>“Perhaps, but I could not teach you,” his mother murmured. “For I have only the second gift, the gift of speaking to animals.”</p><p>Laurent smiled. “Like the swans!”</p><p>“Like the swans. I’ve met a few who share this gift, but like me, those people feel more comfortable near the mountains, in the places where animals are not in cages. It can be a difficult life, sparrow. As the stories go, there were once many of us in Vere, but now…so few remember.</p><p>“The third gift is lost or rare. I’ve never known one with the gift of nature-speaking, though the stories insist it existed, once. I strain my ears and my eyes and my mind…but I do not know the tongue of fire or wind or tree. Someday, I hope, someone will discover how to hear it again.”</p><p>The queen was quiet then, and Laurent thought the story might be over. He looked up at the oak tree they sat under and wondered what it would say.</p><p>His mother stood and took his hand, looking down at him with her somber blue eyes. “I felt the earth shift to make a place for you when you were born,” she told him. “And you, like me, were born with a word on your tongue. Only you know it, and someday, you will discover it on your own. I cannot teach you that.”</p><p>Laurent reached out and brushed his small fingers over the tree’s rough bark, blinking up at his mother earnestly. “But you can teach me to speak with the swans.”</p><p>She swallowed and nodded. “Yes, my little prince. But listen – you must tell no one what I teach you. The Council will be suspicious. Your uncle will spread rumors. Your father will be angry.”</p><p>Laurent’s eyes widened. “But why, Mother?”</p><p>She sighed, tipping her head up to the sky. “Others are suspicious of those who speak with wild beasts.”</p><p>*</p><p>They returned each day to the pond under the guise of morning strolls. But when no gardener or courtier was near, Laurent practiced the sounds he heard the swans make.</p><p>His mother was a patient and encouraging teacher. “Their world is much simpler than ours, sparrow, so they need fewer words. Listen, the sounds often repeat – the large one is greeting the one with the gray speckles. They are sisters. If they were brothers, the sound would not go up at the end.”</p><p>“I heard it,” Laurent said proudly. “Like this.” And he repeated it perfectly.</p><p>“Yes,” his mother said softly, proud in her own way. “You can notice the tiny differences and imitate them – that is your talent. But it takes practice, too – like learning a foreign language.” Laurent made a face – though he was only seven, his tutors had begun insisting he start studying Akielon and Patran. Laurent much preferred the swans’ language to the ugly, harsh syllables of the south.</p><p>His mother laughed at his disgruntled expression. “Well, perhaps it is not <em>exactly</em> like learning Akielon.”</p><p>Laurent huffed. “If it was, I would’ve stopped listening to the swans ages ago.”</p><p>His mother rolled her eyes in a very unqueenly way. Laurent loved when she did unqueenly things around him – it made her feel more like a friend than a mother. “You are a prince,” she reminded him. “And Akielos is our neighbor country.”</p><p>“Our mean neighbor country,” Laurent mumbled.</p><p>She looked at him sharply. “Has your father been filling your head with talk of ‘Akielon barbarians’ again?”</p><p>“Well, they are,” Laurent said defensively. “Their king tries to take our land! And Father says they walk around naked –”</p><p>His mother rubbed her temple and closed her eyes. “Laurent,” she said, in a tone that was very queenly indeed. He wilted under her disapproving blue gaze, though it softened after a few moments. “Your father knows many things, but he is no expert on Akielos. It is unfair to judge people you know little about. Do you understand that, Laurent?” He nodded timidly. “The Akielons are not barbarians or monsters. They are people, like you and me.” She smiled. “Maybe not quite like you and me. But that does not make them bad. Just different.”</p><p>“Different,” Laurent repeated. “I’ll try not to forget that, Mother.”</p><p>“Good,” she said, smile growing. “Now, would you like to speak to the falcons today?”</p><p>And so it was that the two of them spent their mornings at the swan pond or in the gardens, trying to call the flitting birds down from the trees. They liked Laurent well enough (when he plied them with seeds and berries, anyway), but they were busy little creatures who rarely stayed to talk. Some days they would visit the chicken and pigeon coops, and Laurent learned some of their squawky, domestic chatter. When the hunt-master was out, they visited the fierce-eyed falcons and sharp-beaked hawks and wide-eyed owls, who spoke too often of killing things for Laurent’s comfort.</p><p>One day, after returning from an unfruitful chase after a wayward pheasant, they passed by the corrals. Laurent stopped at the warm, earthy smell, going up on his tiptoes and peering through the slats of the fence at the stable-master, who was riding a handsome chestnut in circles around and around. His mother watched him wordlessly.</p><p>After a minute or two, he said, “I want to speak to that one. The horse.”</p><p>His mother touched his shoulder. “Ah. Such a clever thing to ask, my little prince. I have tried to speak to many animals, you know. The wild ones, the deer and wolves, will not stay still long enough to listen or be listened to. The small animals like lizards, toads, and rats have a language that is perhaps too simple and quick for us bigger animals to truly understand. And the domestic creatures like dogs and cats and cows have grown used to communicating with us in their own ways, without words. Birds are perfect for speech but they do little more than talk, as you have seen.”</p><p>She smiled. “But the horse, ah, Laurent, the horse is a very special creature. Do you remember when I told you that you were born with a word on your tongue?” He nodded. “Before you were born, I helped one of the grooms deliver a foal. Most improper for a queen, of course, but I was curious and insistent, and so the little filly fell into my arms. And I heard her, just after she tumbled out, emit a mournful little sound, something which sounded like ‘Yulee.’ Laurent, it was her name. Horses are born with their name on their tongues, and once you repeat it back to them, you can always hear them and they can always hear you. Like a voice in your head. Yulee still speaks to me whenever I am near. I have tried it with a litter of kittens and a calf and newly hatched chicks, but only the horse has responded. What do you think of that?”</p><p>“I think,” Laurent whispered, “that I would like a horse friend. Very much.”</p><p>His mother shook her head. “Not yet, my little prince. You are too young.”</p><p>Laurent pouted. “But…but I am clever, I am talented, you said –”</p><p>“All the cleverness in the world will not stop you from falling and hitting your head,” she interrupted, though her tone was still gentle. “Not yet does not mean never, Laurent. Someday, some year, you may go to the stable as often as you wish and your father will not fret and your uncle cannot stop you. But for now, you must be content with your winged friends.”</p><p>He nodded and turned away reluctantly, only to startle back – there was someone else on the path running along the corrals.</p><p>It was Councillor Guion, Lord of Fortaine, and his son, Aimeric. They were visiting Arles for the summer. He inclined his head to them, and the queen gazed coolly back. “Your Majesty,” he murmured, and then to Laurent, “Your Highness.”</p><p>His son was pretty and poised, with hair like burnished bronze and high, rosy cheeks. He walked with his hands clasped neatly and head held high, eyes centered on the path ahead. As a little boy he had been prone to violent tantrums, notorious for screaming, rolling on the floor like a landed fish, and turning all shades of pink and purple. But he was seven now, like Laurent, and seemed prim as any noble’s son.</p><p>“Hello, Prince Laurent,” Aimeric said sweetly. “We are going to the gardens. Come for tea sometime.”</p><p>“Thank you,” Laurent said, a bit uneasy. There was something dark in the boy’s gaze, something false in the line of his smile. But then Aimeric’s eyes flicked down respectfully and the feeling passed as he did, leaving Laurent with narrowed eyes and his mother close beside him.</p><p>“What a serious little boy,” his mother remarked. “Guion has so many sons, I lose track, but none are quite so…mature.”</p><p>“I am mature,” Laurent said, tugging at her sleeve.</p><p>She held him closer, her eyes flickering. “Yes,” she said. “Yes, you are.” She shook herself a little and forced a smile. “But enough talk of silly things like nobles and tea. Let us spend the rest of the day at the swan pond, shall we?”</p><p>The days turned into months which turned into years.</p><p>*</p><p>Laurent did not just grow up clever. He grew up beautiful.</p><p>Like a flower, his uncle said. Laurent hated being compared to a flower.</p><p>Auguste was never compared to flowers. He was never called “delicate” or “demure.” By the time he was ten, Auguste spent most of his time outside sparring with blunted swords, learning falconry, and hunting with the king. By the time Laurent was ten, he spent most of his time confined to the palace, drowning in Akielon grammar books and learning the etiquette expected of him as a Veretian prince. His escapes to the garden and swan pond with his mother were his only respite from the monotony, but in the winter of his tenth year those visits ended as his mother fell ill.</p><p>His uncle assured him it was nothing to worry about – the queen was delicate like Laurent, he said, and prone to bouts of illness in the cold months. Still, Laurent could not help but worry whenever he saw his father kneeling beside her bed, lips moving in unspoken prayers, his mother’s fair face paler than the snow outside.</p><p>Auguste, now fourteen, tried to distract Laurent as best he could from their ailing mother’s pain. Fourteen and tall for his age, the Crown Prince cut an impressive figure, and at times Laurent could hardly believe Auguste was his brother. But he was, and so he let Laurent ride on his shoulders through the palace halls when nobody was looking, and he showed Laurent how to plan trade routes and make battle plans, and on Laurent’s eleventh birthday, he finally capitulated to Laurent’s endless pleas for Auguste to teach him how to spar.</p><p>They practiced in Auguste’s own private training ring with wooden swords. Laurent wanted to use the real ones, but after Auguste disarmed him in five seconds he relented and played by his brother’s rules. More or less. Laurent was not as skilled or strong as his brother, but he was faster and quicker-thinking, so he tended to use tactics which Auguste called “dirty” and “underhanded.” Laurent preferred to think of them as <em>resourceful</em>.</p><p>After four glorious months of training Laurent managed to last five minutes against Auguste, which was difficult to do even for most of the boys Auguste trained with. Laurent almost wished his uncle had seen it.</p><p>He was not delicate. He was not demure. He was no shrinking violet.</p><p>But perhaps he should have been careful what he wished for, because on a sunny spring day when Auguste was teaching him how to fight with a real sword, they were interrupted by none other than their uncle. He paused on the threshold with several official-looking documents in his arms and raised an eyebrow at the two of them, mouth thinning in disapproval.</p><p>Auguste raised an eyebrow right back, folding his arms and facing their uncle squarely. “Can I help you?”</p><p>“Auguste,” his uncle said, sighing. “Really? Sparring with <em>Laurent</em>? Your little brother belongs in the library, not the ring.”</p><p>Auguste didn’t back down. “Does he? Or would you just prefer for him to have no way to defend himself?”</p><p>There was something sharp and tense in the air, suddenly. Laurent did not understand Auguste’s set jaw or his uncle’s narrowed eyes, but he did not like it.</p><p>His uncle laughed lightly, breaking the heavy silence. “He appears very capable of defending himself. Something tells me that this illicit sparring was not a one-time occurrence. His stance is perfect.”</p><p>“I know,” Laurent said, startling both of them. He drew himself up to his full height (which was not very tall at all) and tipped his chin up. “I have been practicing.”</p><p>Auguste gave him a <em>look</em>. His uncle sighed and shook his head, his voice taking on that disappointed, dangerous tone that made Laurent want to do whatever he wanted and stay out of his way at the same time. “I expected better from you, Auguste. From both of you. What if Laurent had gotten hurt? You would never have forgiven yourself. He is too young, and not suited to the sword like you are.”</p><p>Laurent bristled. “Not <em>suited</em>?! You said yourself my stance was perfect!”</p><p>“Laurent,” Auguste said, running a hand through his hair. “Perhaps…it is best that we postpone this training until you’re older.”</p><p>Laurent whirled on him, eyes wide with betrayal. <em>Don’t listen to him!</em> he wanted to scream. <em>He’s using his gift against you; he’s twisting your thoughts with his people-speaking like he always does.</em> But he could not say that. His uncle would only turn it against him somehow. So, furiously, he held his tongue.</p><p>“There is the reasonable young man I know you to be,” his uncle said approvingly, nodding to Auguste, who was halfheartedly glaring at him. “And, Laurent…I’m afraid your father will have to hear about this, in order for it to be properly enforced. Come, I will take you to him. Don’t look so upset – this is for your own good, nephew.” He extended a ringed hand to Laurent. Laurent looked at it as if it was coated in poison. (For all he knew, it was.)</p><p>“You,” Laurent gritted out, sword still held tightly, “are not taking me anywhere.”</p><p>Surprise flickered briefly in his uncle’s eyes. He was unused to being disobeyed. Well, he was just going to have to learn to get used to it if he continued to see Laurent as a fragile flower and tried to stop him from doing what he wanted. His uncle’s hand withdrew. “Very well,” he said evenly. “But I think you will find the repercussions to be far harsher if you continue to be so insolent.”</p><p>“I don’t care,” Laurent snapped.</p><p>“Oh, I think you will,” his uncle said, and turned on his heel to bring the king the news.</p><p>*</p><p>The repercussions were very harsh.</p><p>Laurent’s father had never spoken to him with such anger before, and accused him not only of sparring secretly, but of insulting his uncle and endangering himself by attempting to practice “dangerous magic.” The king declared he was to be kept in the palace at all times, and was not to be allowed anywhere near the gardens, mews, corrals, or swan pond. Laurent barely stopped himself from crying out in protest when the sentence was delivered – it was early spring and the snows were just beginning to melt. He had not visited the swans in months, and now his reunion was to be delayed even further? It was not fair.</p><p>His mother remained bound to her sickbed, though some days she was able to walk around her apartments and look out the window. He told her, without details, of his punishment, and she offered him a small, sad smile. “I am glad,” she murmured in a soft, dry voice, “that your brother taught you.”</p><p>“But I cannot see the swans,” he said petulantly.</p><p>“You can see them from my window,” she told him. “Most other birds have gone south. But the swans remain. They will have cygnets in the spring. You should be careful when you visit them then – they are very protective.”</p><p>“You can visit them with me,” Laurent started, but she touched his arm lightly and shook her head.</p><p>“Maybe,” she said. “And maybe not.” Her eyes were unfocused, shadowed by tired bags that looked like bruises. “You are strong, Laurent. You must always stay strong, even if I am gone.”</p><p>“You’re not gone,” he said stubbornly. “You’re not going anywhere, Mother.”</p><p>“Not yet,” she agreed, and held him close as if he was a baby again. She sang him a song about forests and dreams, and he clung to every word with unshed tears pricking at his eyes.</p><p>*</p><p>Although Auguste tried to make Laurent’s imprisonment as entertaining as possible, Laurent felt hollow and restless as the days dragged on. In his world of cold marble floors and aged tutors and whispering courtiers Laurent yearned for the wild strangeness of the birds’ voices. Even after a new aged tutor ranted on and on about the evils of “heathen magicks,” Laurent yearned.</p><p>His chance came on a cool evening when his father held a ball. It was in honor of some general’s wedding, and though Laurent was expected to attend he could have cared less. Still, he let himself be laced up into frilly party clothes and even ate a few little cakes before his chaperones were sufficiently distracted and he managed to slip away, tugging his boots off and running across the damp grass, the breeze ruffling his hair and chilling him with every step.</p><p>Once he reached the gardens, he glanced back – the ballroom was a glittering diorama enclosed in glass and gold, and all the people within it were perfect figurines, each in their own perfect place. Laurent realized, with a jolt, that he did not have a place there among them.</p><p>He ran to the pond. The darkness was more complete the farther he got from the radiant palace – so dark that the stables and corrals were merely a suggestion of hulking structures, and the trees loomed like watchful sentinels. And when he looked up, the stars seemed dimmer than usual, and so very distant, and with a stumble Laurent realized that he was too small to run away.</p><p>He collapsed on the pond’s bank, drawing his knees up to his chest and letting the freezing water lap at his bare toes. One swan, roused by his arrival, swam over and greeted him, nesting in the sand beside him.</p><p><em>I am tired,</em> Laurent told him, <em>and lost from my flock.</em></p><p>The swan words he spoke sounded not unlike the mournful wail of a child. The swan nestled closer. <em>Sleep here</em>, was all it said.</p><p>So, putting one arm over his face as though it were a wing, he did.</p><p>He awoke when two strong hands lifted him.</p><p>“Laurent,” Auguste whispered, his voice sounding very far away though it was next to Laurent’s ear. “Laurent, please wake up.”</p><p>Laurent’s eyelids felt too heavy to open, his body strangely numb as Auguste hefted him up. Laurent’s head lolled against his shoulder. He smelled like fireplaces and cider. “I’m awake,” he slurred, though he did not feel like he was. Then he shivered violently, and the numbness was at once replaced by a bone-deep cold, his teeth chattering and skin prickling with goose bumps.</p><p>“What were you thinking,” Auguste started, and then stopped, perhaps realizing that chastising him was a bit of a lost cause. Instead, he unpinned the cloak from his shoulders and wrapped it around Laurent, who still shuddered but let the sudden warmth lull him into a feverish slumber as Auguste carried him back to the palace.</p><p>For three weeks he drifted in and out of that same feverish slumber, his apartments filled with physicians as they had been when he was first born. Somewhere, Laurent was sure his uncle was gloating, as his nickname around the palace all too often became “the delicate child.” His father, when he visited, knelt beside Laurent’s bed as he did with his mother, and prayed.</p><p>Laurent dreamed in strange, fragmented flashes, of familiar faces and unfamiliar hands and a dark forest filled with birds who warned him of death at every turn, until the trees were filled with shrill warnings and he awoke, gasping and soaked in sweat.</p><p>Auguste had apparently not been alone when he found Laurent – he had been assisted by two young guards called Jord and Lazar, and they were assigned to his personal guard shortly after. Laurent liked them – they were loyal and told jokes they should not tell in front of an eleven year old. That was a good thing that came of his near-death experience.</p><p>Another good thing was that, out of all of the physicians, one stayed permanently. Paschal, who was a middle-aged man with kind eyes and a funny hat, always gave Laurent extra blankets and let him take his medicine with spoonfuls of honey. The king appointed him as court physician, but ironically Laurent saw Paschal more often than his own father.</p><p>But the best thing was that, at the end of the three weeks, when Laurent awoke and the fever had broken, his mother was sitting at his bedside.</p><p>“Hello, sparrow,” she said, beaming from ear to ear. “The cygnets hatched today.”</p>
