    <p> </p>
<p>The marine base courtyard bakes in the sun. The cobbles are parched, the gravel coughs dust, and over the compound wall Luffy climbs, rubber body sizzling and sweltering in the heat. His footsteps fall heavy, flip-flops flapping and smacking against the dirt, but there is nobody around to stop his saunter into the square - not even an animal at his side, a ferret or a dog or a bear ambling in the shadows, hushed and whispering <em>hey Luffy</em>, as a daemon of his should do.</p>
<p>Thrust crocked through the ground is a cross, two wooden stakes the centrepiece of this thirsty, blazing yard, but it is the man that's tied there that catches Luffy's eye. Slouched into the restraints like he's waiting, like he's lazy and bored and <em>well</em>, the man lifts a hanging head to meet Luffy's gaze high. Sweat dribbles off his chin, skin blistering and sore from the sun, but his eyes are proud though tired, stubborn and yet hinting to a pain that must be impossible to hide.</p>
<p>Luffy surveys the courtyard one more time, peeking out from beneath the scratchy brim of his hat, but the pirate and the prisoner are all there is to be seen.</p>
<p>"Hey," he greets, considering this half-starved, animal of a man bound before him. The ropes are cruel around his wrists, wound tightly to bloody the skin, and he must have been here for days to smell so bad, abandoned to heatstroke and torture out here in the sun. Regardless, Luffy smiles as if this is enough to stitch the man back together, heal his wounds, have him fed, but the prisoner just squints rather dubiously as the pirate rocks back onto his heels.</p>
<p>"You're the pirate hunter, Roronoa Zoro, right?" Luffy asks, probably not imagining Coby's distant whimper.</p>
<p>"What of it," grumbles the man at the stake, clearly not doing a very good job of pirate hunting if his current condition is anything to go by. The people in the bar spoke highly of him though (spoke of loyalty and kindness and a heart that only beats to dare) so Luffy merely snickers at the threatening rumble and continues to grin.</p>
<p>"Join my crew!" he announces, extending out a hand, and Zoro stares at it with flabbergast, limbs bound and too tired to even laugh.</p>
<p>"No," is the unwavering answer; <em>are you crazy</em>, is left unsaid.</p>
<p>Luffy just gives his hand a wave, waggling it in the space between them. Zoro isn't in any position to take it, but Makino always said that it's the thought that counts.</p>
<p>"I'll release you," laughs the straw-hatted boy, but despite this attractive offer, the pirate hunter only sneers.</p>
<p>"<em>No way</em>," he stresses, the invitation seeming to have offended him. Truthfully, Luffy can appreciate that; he, too, would refuse an "easy" way out, but the pride they share isn't exactly <em>assisting</em> his recruitment of a first mate right now.</p>
<p>"I made a promise and I'm not going to break it," Zoro snaps by way of explanation - and it's a good explanation, one worth commending, really, but what good will dying out in the sun do for a promise like that?</p>
<p>(There's a fine line between dying recklessly and recklessly dying and maybe Zoro's yet to find it - maybe Luffy's yet to find it, too).</p>
<p>"What if I got your sword back?" Luffy tries, still waving his hand as though to entice Zoro into agreeing. "Coby said you're a swordsman - so you've got a sword, right? I could get it back."</p>
<p>Rope creaks as the hunter shakes his head, his body pulled taut and immovable into agony. Glaring from beneath his bandana, Zoro growls, "Get <em>lost</em>," with all the strength he can muster, which Luffy notes isn't exactly a <em>no</em>.</p>
<p>Still - "What if I got your daemon back?"</p>
<p>"Pax?" Zoro replies, likely an involuntary call as he jerks against the stake, shoes clawing against the ground. Luffy remembers how his brothers had done the same whenever their souls had wandered, unable to resist throwing their hearts out in search to the places that their daemons had bound. How strange it must be, Luffy thinks, watching Zoro clench his hands in the rope (unclench them and hiss at the pain), to feel such a pull but be helpless to answer.</p>
<p>But then Zoro barks, "Forget it," and Luffy folds his hands behind his beloved straw-hat, only growing more curious about his first-mate-to-be.</p>
<p>"We made a promise that nothing is going to get in the way of our dream," Zoro explains, tugging at his restraints with a growl. Sunlight catches on his face as his bandana slips, hollowed cheekbones and a sharp, <em>hungry</em> jaw twisting into a snarl. "Not even <em>this</em>."</p>
<p>"But what if you die out here?" Luffy asks as he tilts his head, squinting in the sun.</p>
<p>The hunter attempts a shrug, shoulders twitching in pain. "So be it."</p>
<p><em>Well that's dumb</em>, Luffy doesn't say, scratching his nose and vowing to protect his first crewmate until Zoro's promise can be fulfilled. It's his duty as a captain, after all, to choose a crew with dreams as magnificent as his own to sail with him to Raftel, and then ensure that they find their heart's most greatest desires.</p>
<p>"Okay," he says to Zoro, pleased with the decision he has reached. If Zoro's frazzled expression is an apt indication, then the pirate hunter is clueless of his captain's conclusion (clueless that he even <em>has</em> a captain now), and Luffy just smiles as he finally lowers his hand.</p>
<p>Zoro's eyes track the motion with a dark and wolfish gaze, suspicious of Luffy's actions as a dog is cornered and abused and beaten by the hand that feeds it - or doesn't, perhaps, in this case.</p>
<p><em>Captain Morgan, was it?</em> Luffy recalls, vowing that the man will <em>die</em> before laying another hand on his crew.</p>
<p>"I'll get your sword back so that you can join me! And if I see Pax, I'll tell 'em that you're pirates now, okay?"</p>
<p>"Err," says Zoro, and that's good enough for Luffy, who promptly reels back a rubbery arm and <em>flings</em> himself into the marine compound, his first mate's exclamation bellowing loud and dumbfounded behind him.</p>
<p>He locates not one but <em>three</em> swords which may or may not be Zoro's, so he takes them all to maximise his success and charges back through the compound with his spirits high, clobbering any flabbergast marines that stand in his way. Daemons in all shapes and sizes scamper out of his path, their furry, scaly, or feathery expressions mirroring that of their soul's, but not once does Luffy spot a wayward daemon, and not once does one respond to his summoning call.</p>
<p>Luffy doesn't worry. It is merely a daemon's nature, after all, to be loyal to no one but who they complement, and if this <em>Pax</em> had come running at Luffy's shout, then what would that say of its loyalty - what would that say of its soul?</p>
<p>(Yes, what would that say?)</p>
<p>Zoro claims all three blades when he's freed. Luffy laughs because that's the <em>best thing he's ever heard of</em>, and then only continues to laugh as Zoro unsheathes them at once and clamps the white one between his teeth. The swordsman's smile is more of a snarl now, canines and smirk on full display, but he fights when Luffy asks and calls him <em>captain</em> though Luffy doesn't, and then when Morgan is smashed face, axe, and all, Zoro sheathes his swords and collapses - <em>crumples</em> - to the ground.</p>
<p>Luffy catches him; lays him down carefully with the swords at his side. Coby wheezes as he scurries over, hand at his chest and hissing <em>oh my god Luffy we almost died!</em> but he, too, kneels down to check the unconscious swordsman, hands moving restlessly over Zoro's wrist, his neck, and the pulse struggling there.</p>
<p>"He must be <em>exhausted</em>," Coby mutters, frowning at the sweat on Zoro's brow and the shadows bruised beneath his eyes. The swordsman doesn't so much as twitch as they manoeuvre him into Luffy's arms, but Luffy does, flinching visibly as he overestimates his first mate's weight; half-starved is <em>accurate</em>, he realises, half-starved and tired and <em>sick</em>.</p>
<p>"He needs a doctor," the captain says, shifting Zoro's terrible weight so that the three katana are secure.</p>
<p>"He needs his <em>daemon</em>," Coby adds, scanning the courtyard as the captain had not an hour before, eyebrows furrowing as only marines and their cowering daemons can be seen. "He's not a Devil Fruit user, is he?"</p>
<p>He shoots Luffy a questioning gaze from behind the thick frames of his glasses, and then glances at his own daemon as if she may know where Zoro's has wandered off to. Tail swishing against the gravel in apparent disinterest, the lioness merely blinks at her companion and roars out a yawn, lolling pink tongue sliding against her teeth.</p>
<p>"His daemon's called <em>Pax</em>," Luffy replies, and while that is all he knows for sure, he has a feeling that the daemon will appear in its own time, when it's safe or when it has decided that Luffy is <em>not</em>, unwilling to linger too far from Zoro now that the swordsman has been freed.</p>
<p>Coby looks uncertain, scratching the top of Fallon's sandy head to reassure himself, but he doesn't argue when Luffy urges them towards the town. The bartender at the inn is quick to offer a room to the recovering swordsman, and her daughter is swifter at fetching a doctor, but if Zoro's daemon is on its way, then it is slow and minding its time. Still, Luffy refuses to worry, no stranger to the strange behaviours of daemons, but he will be glad to see this <em>Pax</em> live and well when it does find its way, if only for reassurance over Zoro's dwindling health.</p>
<p>He leaves Zoro in the doctor's capable hands, and when he returns with his arms laden with food (for himself, not for Zoro, even if he hadn't sworn not to feed the first mate without strict supervision), his patience and optimism are greatly rewarded. For there, snoozing beside its human counterpart, is a daemon in the shape of dog; a large dog, bulky and refined where Zoro is not (where he should be, where he will), but curled up on the bed all the same. It is an unusual mix of whites and greys and ragged, almost-gold tinted fur, but when the dog lifts its head to turn the sharp gaze (the sharp eyes, muzzle, and teeth) of a predator towards him, it is all Luffy can do to freeze in the doorway and think - <em>wolf</em>.</p>
<p>(Or - something of a wolf, anyway; something more than a dog, no doubt).</p>
<p>Pax watches Luffy for a moment, watches him recover from surprise and amble into the room, and then recurls on the duvet to match Zoro's slumber breath-for-breath.</p>
<p>Luffy stuffs a sausage roll into his mouth to stop himself from cooing.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>"So you're a Devil Fruit user?" is the second thing out of Zoro's mouth upon waking, the first being a groan, a mumbled <em>where...?</em> and then a yelping curse of <em>Pax gerroff!</em> as his wolfdog daemon rolls over and flattens him into the bed. Luffy smiles at the affectionate display, pleased as the daemon is that Zoro is finally, truly awake; he's been unresponsive for days, somewhere not quite asleep but unable to wake, and he must be hungry, Luffy thinks, just as he must be relieved to have his daemon back at his side.</p>
<p>Even if Pax is slobbering all over him.</p>
<p>"Uh-huh, I'm a rubberman!" Luffy replies, offering the swordsman a glass of water. He should probably call the doctor right away, but this is the most alert he's seen Pax all week, let alone Zoro, so giving them a moment to reunite will only do them good. Plus, Pax hasn't much appreciated the flurry of strangers, Zoro's exhaustion heightening her wariness to growling and snarling at anyone who approaches.</p>
<p>"It's true then?" the first mate asks, sipping carefully at the water. He's dog-tired, dehydrated with a deathly sort of colour still lingering in his skin, but still manages a smile when Pax tries to dig under the duvet to lay closer to his side. "What they say about Devil Fruit users and daemons, that is."</p>
<p>Luffy tilts his head, sun-guard brim of his hat slipping over his eyes. "<em>Ah</em>? Depends what they say," he says, dazzling Zoro's suspicion with a smile. "I've not met many other Devil Fruit users!"</p>
<p>"They say you haven't got daemons," Zoro claims, eyebrows rising to exaggerate his questioning, <em>well?</em> "That you give them up for power."</p>
<p><em>Oh?</em> breathes Luffy, continuing to smile. Pax is watching him now, her eyes warning danger from over Zoro's thigh. It would be cute were she not an animal of silver and bronze, a snout of knives and a coat of blood, a daemon with a swordsman's unbending will, but it does endear her to Luffy, unused to a daemon's enduring presence as he is.</p>
<p>"<em>Weird</em>," the captain says, picking his nose in disinterest. He elaborates no further, disinclined to discuss such a controversial matter, and Zoro sighs his acquiescence just as the door clicks open, bidding Coby and his lioness daemon inside.</p>
<p>"Oh! Zoro-san you're - you're up!" the boy squeaks, beginning to fiddle with the end of his sleeve. The marines had outfitted him with a uniform just the day before, and like any child thrust with wide, wondrous eyes towards their dream, Coby has yet to take it off.</p>
<p>"Has the doctor been up here yet? Have you had anything to eat?" he asks, glancing pointedly at Luffy. He rolls his eyes and presses on before the captain can answer, however, apparently deciding that asking after Luffy's forethought is a waste of time. "I could go and get him - I <em>should</em> go and get him! Yeah, I'll - err - I'll just -"</p>
<p>He almost trips over his daemon in his haste to scamper out, which is quite a remarkable feat considering Fallon's size.</p>
<p>"<em>Great</em>," Zoro sighs as boy and lion pad down the hallway, clearly thrilled about the inevitable check-up. Being men second only to the sea, they <em>could</em> make a quick get-away (once a pirate, always a pirate it seems), but Luffy values his nakama's health over racing to their next adventure, and he isn't sure that Pax will let Zoro escape the bed anyway.</p>
<p>(He'd say <em>good dog</em> except that would both be patronising and likely to result in her tearing his throat out. After all, if she's inherited even an <em>ounce</em> of Zoro's stubbornness, then she'll be the kind of daemon who will fight and challenge and <em>die</em> for what she wants - for what Zoro wants, for what they both want, and for what they're prepared to risk everything for).</p>
<p>(As Luffy continues to smile, he glances just briefly towards the open window, the clouds, the sky, and the horizon rising purple and pink and gold over there, and he cannot help but think that they are <em>all</em> going to get along rather well).</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Daemons rarely interact with those beyond their other half, so it doesn't surprise Luffy to receive only silence from the wolfdog. Zoro, himself, says little beyond what's necessary, instead grunting and growling almost as much as his daemon, something that certainly doesn't encourage Pax to be any more conversational. In fact, the daemon is quiet even around other daemons, seeming to hold no interest in meeting and greeting the many souls that bound past, although it should be noted that few do approach her mountainous form, instead cowering into themselves to offer the hound a wide berth. Neither man nor wolf so much as blink at the fear, long-since used to the stares that follow them just as Luffy is used to the ones that follow <em>him</em>, whispers and pointing and mutters of <em>dear god</em>.</p>
<p>(<em>Dear god, where's his daemon?</em>)</p>
<p>Zoro hasn't enquired about the matter since the first time; in fact, he hasn't really asked at <em>all</em> about Luffy's upbringing, preferring instead to follow the captain without so much as batting an eyelash, so Luffy returns the favour. Truthfully, his first mate's past is his own, and Luffy likes Zoro for who he is now, regardless of who he was or may have been.</p>
<p>He learns a lot about the swordsman in their first few months together (food preferences, sleeping patterns, how he behaves towards the world) but still somehow seems to know very little. Zoro's family is a mystery; his friends even more so. His favourite colour is anybody's guess (although Luffy could <em>probably</em> guess), and his hobbies beyond swordsmanship are completely unfathomable.</p>
<p>Unless <em>drinking</em> and <em>getting lost</em> count as hobbies, because both are pastimes in which Zoro excels. A wolfdog daemon is particularly useful in terms of achieving the former, something that still amuses Luffy weeks after the swordsman explains the reasoning behind his bar-finding knack.</p>
<p>"Her nose is a lot better than mine," Zoro had said, shrugging as though training up an alcoholic scent hound is an acceptable use for a half-wolf mix of a daemon.</p>
<p>Pax's heightened sense of smell has its uses beyond sniffing out alcohol. Telling Zoro not to bounty hunt now that he's a pirate means their financial income is limited, and as such, this had been the topic of their first "real" argument.</p>
<p>"We can hunt for food," Luffy had argued, raised in a jungle and adapting to foraging as he is. Having a wolfdog to track their prey only helps, but neither Zoro nor Pax had shared his enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"We can't hunt for <em>everything</em>," Zoro had countered, looking more like a first mate in that moment than he ever had before, expression hard and steady and his shoulders tight, arms crossed before the captain's easy smile. "There's more to worry about than food - clothes, medicine, <em>supplies for the ship</em>."</p>
<p>"We don't have a ship."</p>
<p>"Yeah because they cost <em>money</em>."</p>
<p><em>Ah true</em>, Luffy had thought, conceding to that one. The chances that they will get even a half-decent ship for free are laughable. "But we don't need clothes or medicine at the moment."</p>
<p>Zoro had looked about ready to <em>strangle</em> him - but with the captain's bounty-less head, that wouldn't have exactly solved the problem. "But we <em>will</em>. You're gonna have to let me get cash <em>somehow</em>, captain. When you're travelling at sea, you can't just live in the present!"</p>
<p>They had failed to reach a compromise at the time, Zoro only growing more incensed with each insistence that pirate bounties were <em>off-limits</em>, but by the next morning he had been oddly complaisant over the matter, and Luffy hadn't pressed. He didn't ask for insight into his first mate's mind; with Pax's growling, Luffy probably wouldn't have received it anyway.</p>
<p>Since then, Zoro hasn't complained about their money even once, so Luffy continues to pretend that he hasn't noticed that the funds don't seem to deplete.</p>
<p>Recruiting Nami and her money-smart, no-nonsense, pirate-hating outlook comes as a relief, despite the aforementioned duo she joins being nothing <em>but</em> pirates. (One day they'll be more than pirates - they'll be the <em>World's Greatest Swordsman</em> and the <em>Pirate King</em>, but not today - not yet). She's a breath of fresh air on the crew, the chilling north wind and the summery south slammed together to produce a girl of lightning and storms, and Luffy likes her instantly. Zoro doesn't seem to hold her in the same regard, treating her carefully, warily, expecting her to leave, and Nami returns the suspicion in kind, her red fox daemon unafraid of hissing when Pax maunders too close.</p>
<p>Pax and Jasper do <em>not</em> get along.</p>
<p>"She's dangerous," the fox whispers one night, curled up on Nami's lap like a cushion. Luffy tries not to listen but it's difficult when their boats are tied together, eavesdropping an inescapable pastime when the sea is sleepy and calm. Jasper doesn't seem to notice that Luffy is awake, and thus neither does Nami, petting the worrying fox under his chin.</p>
<p>"They're pirates," she argues; <em>they</em>, she says, not <em>we</em>. "They're all dangerous."</p>
<p>"The captain's a Devil Fruit user," Jasper continues, scarlet ears twitching under his other half's hand. "Buggy didn't have a daemon either, but…"</p>
<p>"But?"</p>
<p>The daemon wiggles, nuzzling his snout further into Nami's tummy before murmuring, "Luffy doesn't seem so bad - for a daemon-killer."</p>
<p>Nami clicks her tongue, holding back a disbelieving snout lest she wake the crew. "He <em>still</em> ate a Devil Fruit."</p>
<p>"But Arlong's never <em>had</em> a daemon, and he's <em>awful</em>," Jasper mutters, which appears to have some significance if Nami's sigh is any indication. "And the swordsman's got a <em>wolf</em>. One wrong move and Pax could <em>eat</em> me."</p>
<p>While that may <em>theoretically</em> be true, Luffy has to stop himself from rushing to Pax's (and by extension, Zoro's) defence. More wolf than dog though she may be (though they both may be, perhaps, her and Zoro together), she is kind at her core, Luffy is sure, because she wouldn't be on his crew were she not.</p>
<p>Nami seems just as unconvinced. "What's your point, Jas?"</p>
<p>"I just think that maybe we should give Luffy a chance," the fox whispers, almost sighing, almost - resigning himself to this. "His daemon could've been a <em>bear</em> or something."</p>
<p>"A bear would've been better than nothing," Nami replies, but she doesn't sound so sure.</p>
<p>Carefully, Luffy rolls over and tries to discreetly block his ears. On the other side of the boat, half-flattened over Zoro as is her favourite spot, Pax's tail thumps once against the deck. Jasper squeaks a curse and almost flies a foot into the air, and only Nami's quick hands stop him from tumbling overboard.</p>
<p>Like Zoro before her, Nami doesn't inquire into Luffy's daemon-less state. She keeps to herself, reserving her affections solely for Jasper as he nips at her heels, but Luffy is sure that she'll open up in time. He can't say when, or why, or even how she will, but she'll come to cherish her place upon his crew; his navigator, his weather-wielding nakama with tangerine hair and a fiery soul. Zoro, too, will come to appreciate her presence beyond a wary tolerance, but by then they'll have two more within their crew - a sniper and a cook, and two more daemons to question the lack of Luffy's own.</p>
<p>Until that time, Nami will keep her secrets and Zoro will withhold his concerns, and it is Pax who will watch the crew with an attentive eye, who will growl at their enemies and prowl between them and the world, a hulking silence in the corner of their vision, following Luffy's gaze up to the sky.</p>
<p>"You've got a daemon," she'll say to him - the first thing she'll <em>ever</em> say to him, mouth of canines and knives grinning wide at her conclusion; at how Luffy smiles with his eyes for once, hat tipping forward to hide it from his crew.</p>
<p>"She'd like you," he'll confirm, and the wolfdog will laugh something savage, less like Zoro in that moment than she ever has been, apart from him just as all daemons are apart from those that complete them; two halves of a whole, but not one and the same.</p>
<p>"Yeah?" will be her snarl, vicious and yet oddly fond as though Luffy has passed some sort of test; gained her approval as well as her attention, and encouraged her to disregard the social expectations that force them not to interact.</p>
<p>"She'd be a fool to like me," Pax will say with a terrible smile, and Luffy will only laugh.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Usopp's mountain weasel daemon can't seem to decide which of the crew's two current daemons should be more feared - the <em>wolf</em> or the <em>fox</em> - and Luffy finds this more entertaining than he probably should do considering that the timid sniper is the newest member of his crew. <em>It's just as well that </em>his<em> daemon isn't here</em>, he thinks, watching Morgandy's adorable ball of dusty fur and terror scamper around the Merry, but eventually he takes pity on the finicky duo and ushers Pax and Jasper from the deck.</p>
<p>(Jasper snaps at him, hissing <em>rude</em>, but Pax only plods off like a sleepy, old Labrador and flops down in the shade where Zoro is training).</p>
<p>"They're big and scary but they won't hurt you," Luffy reassures his newest nakama, patting the boy on the shoulder, and Usopp's laugh wobbles like a lie in the air.</p>
<p>"Y-yeah, of course!" he cries, striking a heroic pose that Luffy wants to believe but really, really doesn't. (He will one day - but just with Zoro and Nami and Raftel and gold, not <em>yet</em>). "We would've been able to take them!"</p>
<p>"We would've!" Morgandy echoes, noticeably less enthusiastically as she zips up Usopp's leg to hide in his dungarees. "We're gonna be brave warriors of the sea!"</p>
<p>"Sure are!" Luffy agrees, because <em>that</em>, if nothing else Usopp and his daemon say, is true. He punches the sniper affectionately before springing across the ship, rubber body and flip-flops smacking the loved decks of the Merry as he bounds to the helm. "Come on, come on, let's set sail! Hey Nami, hey Nami, can we go yet?"</p>
<p>Elbows leaning on the wheel, Nami holds up a hand at the captain's approach; Luffy skids to a halt immediately, laughing boisterously as his hat tips forward to hang precariously from her arm.</p>
<p>"Where to?" Nami asks, plopping the hat back onto his head. Her hands linger on the brim for a moment, fingertips marvelling at the scratchy edges of straw, but then she shakes her head to rid herself of whatever thought had caused her to hesitate. Quiet and intent, Jasper head-butts her leg like a cat, and Nami's expression resumes its typical smirk.</p>
<p>Something is troubling her, but Luffy doesn't ask. (It's not his place to ask, really, when she's not yet comfortable with her place on the crew). "<em>You're</em> the navigator," he replies instead, adopting a gleeful cheer as she blinks, taken aback. "You decide!"</p>
<p>"Well <em>all right</em>," she drawls, but Jasper emits a chirpy little sound at her sound, disclosing her happiness. She sighs at the captain - sighs at them <em>both</em>, looking at her daemon as though to curse, <em>thanks a bunch Jas</em> - then flicks Luffy's elasticated skin hard enough for it to ping. "Go and make yourself useful and pull up the anchor or something."</p>
<p>Luffy bounces away to do just that, mindful to avoid the scurrying of their now-smallest member of the crew. Morgandy would be safer on Usopp's shoulders, it's true, but the Going Merry is just as much her ship as anybody else's (or more so, perhaps; the Merry will <em>always</em> be Usopp's at heart), and she should feel safe to roam the ship despite her small size. There will probably be accidents because there are <em>always</em> accidents; daemons are masters of moving in the shadows - in their other half's shadow, and weaving around everybody else - but Zoro has tumbled over Pax more times than Luffy can count, so care should be taken.</p>
<p>Admittedly, Pax does seem to intentionally <em>put herself</em> in Zoro's way, be it through a desire to be seen - to be recognised and <em>known</em> - or through her need to protect the crew extending even to Zoro, only for the swordsman's stubbornness to clash with and refute the daemon at every turn.</p>
<p>They live together, man and wolf, and will die together of that there is no doubt, so it's bizarre and funny and terribly, terribly sad to see them squabble over <em>who</em> must perish first.</p>
<p><em>Neither of you</em>, Luffy wants to say, but he holds his tongue as he does for all the other demons that shape, define, and haunt his crew. Rather, he says nothing of Pax's vigil (of Zoro's fierce independence, Jasper's uncertainty, Nami's suspicion), just as he says nothing of the daemon-less air that surrounds him, his rubber body strong and hard against the feathers of a shadow that should be at his side.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the Baratie - or, what's left of it once the Straw Hats arrive - they meet a young man with a heart of gold and hair to match, who grumbles and curses but gives a piece of himself to every person who walks through the door. Luffy is no exception - or he <em>will</em> be no exception once the sous-chef accepts his place upon their wayward crew, a place that has always been waiting for him, just as it waited for Zoro and Nami and Usopp before. Sanji's dream is as elusive and unattainable as the captain's own, so surely it deserves to be fulfilled by the Pirate King and his crew, just as Sanji's heart deserves a place to be kept - somewhere safe, for himself, and the motley band of pirates (idiots) that he will come to call <em>crew</em>.</p>
<p>The Baratie is also home to the largest daemon Luffy has <em>ever seen</em>, but Arabella is something of a softie if what Sanji claims holds true. Apparently the man she exists beside is anything <em>but</em>, although Luffy isn't sure about that as he listens to the head and sous chefs bicker on the scattered remains of the deck. Zeff <em>does</em> seem unapproachable in every sense, tall and gruff and prone to wrecking things with his awesome peg-leg, but the fact that he hasn't kicked Luffy out and didn't allow a crew of one hundred to starve on his doorstep speaks volumes.</p>
<p>Plus, for all of Arabella's hulking around the Baratie, her growling, her temper, and the way her four great paws patrol <em>plod plod plod</em> behind Zeff's uneven pace, there is tremendous <em>care</em> in how she interacts with Sanji's smaller daemon - shoves and swats and snaps and sighs, but never enough to cause truly cause harm.</p>
<p>Zeff and Sanji argue almost constantly, cursing and grumbling and threatening violence, but it is their daemons that Luffy watches, Zeff's bear hardly twitching as Sanji's sea otter tumbles around it.</p>
<p>"They love each other a lot," Luffy remarks as the chef duo spit fire, their bickering over Don Krieg and the state of the ship as unceasing as the waves pulling the tide up to the shore. At Usopp's flabbergast, <em>what makes you say that</em>, Luffy gestures, not to the men, but to where the sea otter is bumbling at Arabella's feet. Heaving a long-suffering sigh, Arabella <em>squashes</em> Sanji's other half onto the deck; the otter <em>squeals</em>, little paws wiggling beneath the Kodiak bear's hefty mass, and Arabella huffs a sound of laughter and only rolls further onto the boisterous daemon.</p>
<p>"That's…" Usopp replies, struggling to find the right word to describe the daemons' play. "That's pretty sweet, actually. But are daemons… <em>usually</em> that close?"</p>
<p>"Raquel used to climb over Evs all the time," Luffy muses, not seeing anything wrong with the chefs' daemons. To touch somebody else's daemon is taboo, yes, but daemons are free to interact with one another as they wish - theoretically, at least. Daemons are subject to their own set of social norms; their behaviour, intentions, and personality reflects that of their other half, so for Arabella and Sanji's daemon to be in such casual contact reveals a great deal of the men's attitudes towards each other.</p>
<p>"Who?" the sniper asks, and Luffy responds with <em>huh?</em> before realising how vague his statement had been.</p>
<p>"Oh, my brother's daemon," he clarifies, laughing as the sea otter flops across the deck, finally wrenching itself to freedom. It wails a noise like a half-drowned cat and scampers over to Sanji, and Arabella follows after a moment, movements hulking and smug as she comes to rest beside Zeff's wooden leg.</p>
<p>Usopp nods, humming an <em>oh okay</em>. His expression settles from bemused to understanding, only to morph back into astonishment as his nodding slows, umber curls bobbing over the pinch of his brow. "But wait," he begins, rubbing his chin. "Is Evs or Raquel -?"</p>
<p>"Hey, you two!" Zeff bellows, waving his hand in a <em>come here</em> or a <em>what are you doing</em> motion; it's hard to tell given the chef's grumpy demeanour, but Usopp squeaking in terror is likely the appropriate response. Beside the large-hatted chef, Sanji seems to have resorted to smoking out his frustrations now that the argument has ended, but the otter at his feet is lounging happily, big eyes and fuzzy nose observing the two pirates curiously.</p>
<p>Morgandy asks, <em>is he talking to us?</em> just as Zeff follows his first roar with: "You kids just going to stand there? Come help with cleaning this dump up!"</p>
<p>"<em>This dump</em> is our restaurant," Sanji mutters.</p>
<p>"Still a dump right now, isn't it?" Zeff shoots back, arguing over the top of Luffy's straw hat as the captain ducks past, dragging the reluctant sniper behind him. "Go scout the waters or something if you're just going to be miserable."</p>
<p>Sanji's expression darkens, but whatever he says next is lost to Luffy as the Baratie's doors swing shut behind him. Inside the desolated restaurant, the clean-up is already well underway; most of the customers are crowded around one of the few intact tables, whispering and cursing to themselves at their wrecked afternoons, but some are assisting the rowdy gang of chefs with sweeping. Taking in the splintered floors, the cannonball shaped holes in the wall, and the glass and china shattered over the decking, Luffy bounces over to where Zoro's daemon is curled up on one of the tables, the delicate tablecloth snagged and muddied under her paws.</p>
<p>"Hey, hey, what should we do with Don-what's-his-face's armour d'you think?" the captain asks at large, Usopp trotting along behind. "It's gold right? Do you think Nami would like it if we kept it? We could give it to her when we get her back!"</p>
<p>Ears twitching as the duo and daemon approach, Pax blinks as though she had truly been asleep amongst this chaos. Luffy hops up onto the table beside her (coincidentally rather than consciously leaving enough space not to be in contact with her fur), and Usopp makes an uncertain sound from the side, eyes darting around the restaurant's ruckus.</p>
<p>"Err, Luffy, aren't we meant to be cleaning?"</p>
<p>Luffy smiles carefree, kicking a chair out in invitation. "Yeah, in a mo!" he says - only, the chair collapses at the assault, four rickety legs unable to withstand the thought of Usopp reaching to sit upon it. Usopp's <em>oh god</em> has the captain shrieking with laughter, and even Pax, slouched half-asleep as she seems to be, huffs a hoarse sound of amusement.</p>
<p>"Maybe we should use the gold to pay the head chef for all the trouble we've caused," Usopp suggests meekly, his mountain weasel daemon squeaking an agreement from inside his dungarees.</p>
<p>Yet, the captain pouts, shaking his head so that his hair flops over his face. "But we're pirates!"</p>
<p>"Err, yes?" Usopp replies, one eyebrow quirking as though to ask, <em>what of it?</em></p>
<p>"<em>Soooo</em>," Luffy goes on, swinging his legs from the tabletop. Usopp's expression scrunches as though the sniper is already aware of where this is going, and Luffy grins. "We can get away with this sort of stuff, right? Plus I already did the dishes!"</p>
<p>Pax laughs, tucking her snout under her paws to smother the sound. Luffy rounds on the wolfdog immediately, barely refraining from poking her in the side to pester her into explaining.</p>
<p>"What, what?" Luffy prompts instead, hearing Morgandy begin to laugh nervously behind him. "What'd I say?"</p>
<p>"Is it always going to be like this?" Usopp bemoans - only, like <em>what</em> Luffy never gets to know, because with Pax's next breath, Zoro comes crashing into the Baratie like a thunderous reckoning, three katana <em>clacking</em> against the wonky doorway like the crack of a lightning bolt splitting open the sky. Pax rises up immediately, <em>dog</em> to <em>wolf</em> as she seems to grow twice in size, charcoal-grey and bronze highlights like a mountain surging up from the earth, and Luffy mirrors her as Zoro charges panting and <em>wild</em> into the room.</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" the captain asks, unsure how to react to Zoro's crumbling composure. But his first mate disregards the question, his eyes only for his daemon and his attention captured elsewhere - by what he's seen, or heard, perhaps, by something that has shaken him or threatened him in a way that Luffy doesn't like. Only months he has known the swordsman, and slightly less than that (truly) has Zoro embraced his role as both a <em>first</em> and the <em>second</em> - but not once has Luffy seen Zoro so impelled, so -</p>
<p><em>Alive</em>.</p>
<p>"He's <em>here</em>," Pax snarls, Zoro snarls, lips curling up to reveal a grin of wicked knives and canines. The daemon vaults from the table, matching Zoro's frantic pace beat-for-beat, two beasts stalking this territory of ruin and rubble. Pax is thunder on the floor, they both are, and just for a moment Luffy feels like he's intruding on a moment as though he had reached for Pax himself; felt her fur beneath his fingertips beyond the sweep of her coat past his arm.</p>
<p>"<em>Right now</em>," the other pants, almost crazed with excitement; they're a spectacle together, man and wolf side-by-side. "<em>We could do this right now</em>."</p>
<p>"Do what?" Usopp asks, regarding the duo with caution. He glances between the first mate and his daemon, and then looks to Luffy for reassurance, Morgandy rustling restlessly within the folds of his clothes.</p>
<p>"Challenge <em>him</em>," Zoro breathes, sounding as though he could choke with the weight of his words. "The Greatest Swordsman in the World."</p>
<p>Usopp doesn't appear to find any reassurance in this, instead whispering, "He's <em>here</em>?" with such a nervous titter that he might pass out at any moment. Poking her little head out of Usopp's pocket, Morgandy whispers, "Sounds like bad news," and the young sniper nods weakly.</p>
<p>"But aren't we going after Nami and Merry?" he asks.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Luffy replies, itching to reach for his hat. It feels heavy at his neck - heavier than it has been all this time, and it must be the weight of Zoro's dream, he realises; Shanks' hat must be weighed down and <em>reinforced</em> by <em>all</em> of his nakama's dreams. "We all are - Sanji too."</p>
<p>He doesn't know if he can guarantee this - he can't force Sanji to join them, and he can't tell Zoro to throw away this opportunity for his heart's greatest desire - but Usopp relaxes at the captain's firm words. Zoro certainly doesn't, although a twice of Pax's jaw, a <em>clink</em> of her claws, and a twitch of her ears are the only indications that Luffy's insistence has bothered him - that is, until Luffy tries to smile, and then the swordsman and his wolfdog release a growl.</p>
<p>"You said you wouldn't stop us."</p>
<p>Luffy nods; he remembers their deal and intends to keep his promise, no matter what Zoro may assume. "I'm not going to stop you," he assures, smiling kindly.</p>
<p>Pax and her other half appear unable not to glance at each other. "You think we'll win?" she asks the straw-hatted captain, and Luffy blinks for a moment, stunned that she has even asked, but then he laughs. These past months have been enough to learn how Zoro gives his loyalty and trust; he differs from Usopp, who will do anything for his friends, and he differs from Nami, who fights and denies but <em>wants</em> desperately to trust, and he differs from Sanji, too, who seems to trust so openly and allows himself to hurt. Zoro's loyalty is solid, steadfast, and unwavering, but hard to gain and keep and call it your own; more challenging to earn than maintain, and Luffy doesn't think he's earned it yet - not like Zoro's dream has, anyway.</p>
<p>But that's - okay.</p>
<p>"D'you care what I think?" the captain asks them both.</p>
<p>Zoro barks,<em> no</em>, urging his daemon to follow as he strides back out. Pax does so without question, fierce and battle-ready like her human half, his fingertips drumming restlessly against Wadō Ichimonji's hilt. Her pace never falters, confident in herself and too full of pride to stumble, but just for a moment - for the slightest of moments - she glances back through the Baratie, dark eyes finding Luffy across the battle that has already taken place on this ship.</p>
<p>Pax says nothing, but Luffy wonders if she wants to.</p>
<p>(He wonders if letting them go is okay).</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Mihawk nearly carves Zoro in two. Blood bespatters the deck of the Baratie, scarlet splatters of agony seeping hot through the cracks of the wood (of Luffy's decision, of Zoro's will) and down into the ocean below. The waves churn, seafoam suds surging up over the battleground, spraying salt and icy water over where the swordsman has fallen. His daemon lays quiet beside him, pride beseeching her not to whimper where she'll be heard. Her opponent - though brief, their meeting only a clash of fangs and will and a monstrous strength - is worthy of walking beside The World's Greatest Swordsman; a daemon to match Pax in every single way, the black panther is a predator the likes of which are scarcely seen. A shadow at Mihawk's heel, she had struck like lightning at his command, formidable, lethal, and tearing into Pax's coat as her other half had severed Zoro head-to-toe, blade and claw moving as one.</p>
<p>For a moment, Zoro lies still, reduced to nothing but an <em>attempt</em> sprawled there on the deck, blood sullying the dispassionate <em>clip-clop</em> of Mihawk's boots. For a moment, he doesn't breathe, and neither does Pax, and neither does <em>Luffy</em> from where he watches from afar, able to intervene but fighting not to. For a moment, it seems that Zoro's journey has come to a terrible end, but then he lifts up his beloved blade and his daemon raises her bloodied head, and they both howl out a promise to themselves, to their captain, and to anybody close enough to witness this moment in history.</p>
<p>(<em>Any problems with that, Pirate King?</em>)</p>
<p>"Forsythia," Mihawk says afterwards (not muttering, of course, it being impossible for him to do so), calling his daemon to him. The panther prowls over, tail swishes like a sword through the air, and not once does she look back at the daemon she almost slayed as they depart.</p>
<p>Her paws stick to the wood as she slips away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nami returns to them with bruises and tears. Arlong Park experiences the reckoning of the Straw Hat pirates, and the crew of five (of nine - of ten, truly) stand strong in the aftermath of the damage they have wrought. <em>Thank you</em>, Nami says once the Merry has sailed away, but with Zoro sleeping away his pain, Usopp occupied at the helm, and Sanji settling into the kitchen waiting for him, only Luffy is there to hear her quiet plea - but maybe she intended for that all along.</p>
<p>"You're my navigator," is Luffy's simple response. His hat is still in Nami's possession, sitting crooked atop her tangerine crown, but he has no desire to take it from her; she'll give it back when she's ready. "We can't go anywhere without you."</p>
<p>She smiles and nods, scratching behind Jasper's ear. The daemon is lounged out over her lap, little paws sticking up in the air and white-tuff belly aimed content to the sky. It's the most relaxed Luffy has seen him to date, and he grins back at the teary-eyed navigator, glad for Jasper's peace of mind.</p>
<p>Sanji's daemon, too, like Jasper and Morgandy before it, takes time to settle into the crew. Playful and gentle and so very, very <em>kind</em> the otter may be, there is a nervousness that haunts it now that they have left the Baratie. With time and good company, Luffy is sure that the daemon will return to its free-spirited self, but it seems to have taken the decision to leave home particularly hard. Sanji betrays little of this unease, immersing himself in his role upon the ship, but maybe the elaborate meals and many hours he spends slaving away in the kitchen discloses his need to impress.</p>
<p>The sea otter will talk to anybody - daemon or human or fishman alike - and though this breach of social conduct is somewhat queer, Luffy is happy to indulge the daemon in conversation. Usopp, too, only falters at the otter's first question, but Zoro and Nami take longer to adjust to the odd behaviour, although Zoro keeps to himself for the most part anyway, and Nami continues to feel wary in the presence of daemons larger than her own.</p>
<p>"I'm <em>Wilhelmina</em>," is the first thing the sea otter ever says to the crew at large, wrinkling its button nose. "But that's a mouthful so you can call me <em>Will</em>, or <em>Willa</em>, I don't mind."</p>
<p>"You're a boy?" Morgandy asks, glancing up at Usopp before edging closer to the new daemon. Wilhelmina leans down to greet the mountain weasel, emitting a noise of amusement as Morgandy adopts a brave face to consider the larger daemon.</p>
<p>"Sometimes," Wilhelmina says, fuzzy tail curling close. "But not really. That's okay, right?"</p>
<p>Morgandy seems taken aback for a moment; overwhelmed to have the entire attention of the deck fixed upon her. Even Pax has perked up from the corner, although Zoro hasn't ceased with groaning and heaving beneath the ridiculous weight of the dumbbells. The mountain weasel flusters, shrinking under the stares, but still tries to bumble through a response for Wilhelmina's sake.</p>
<p>"Sure! If that's what you're happy with, right? But… what shall we call you?"</p>
<p>"<em>Will</em>," the otter says, clearly confused at having to repeat this. "Or <em>Willa</em>. Either's fine…?"</p>
<p>"That's not what she means, idiot," Sanji interjects, sweeping past with a plate of drinks and sweet treats from the kitchen. He pats his daemon's head fondly as he does so, unable to resist smiling at Wilhelmina's dazed little sound.</p>
<p>"<em>They/them</em> is good," he says, crouching beside Morgandy. The weasel tenses, aware that with one move from the otter she could be trapped between the cook and his daemon, and Usopp, too, makes an uncertain noise as Sanji pulls something from the tray. "Here, do you want something to eat? You should let me know if you like it."</p>
<p>Flabbergast, Morgandy takes the offered piece of food from the chef. Sanji smiles, moving with a care not to touch Usopp's daemon, and then holds another treat out for Jasper to inspect. The fox hesitates, ears pulled back, but then shuffles forward to take the snack at Nami's nudge of reassurance.</p>
<p>"How… is it?" Usopp asks his daemon. He crouches opposite the chef, holding out his hand, and Morgandy zips up his arm to settle in her favourite spot in his pocket, still clutching the treat between her teeth.</p>
<p>"I like it," she murmurs, and Wilhelmina laughs a relieved, <em>I told you she would!</em> "Thank you. But I don't need to eat, you know."</p>
<p>"You're welcome," Sanji says, almost glowing at the praise. "And it's my duty as a chef to feed everyone on the ship, so that includes you - and Jasper, and you, Pax," he adds, calling over to the wolfdog half-snoozing beside her other half's shadow. "If you want it."</p>
<p>"Or if you don't," Wilhelmina says, still laughing, and Pax merely flicks her tail before lowering her head to her paws once again.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over Reverse Mountain they go, screaming all the while. At the base they nearly crash into a whale of monstrous proportions, and it's only Luffy's quick (and perhaps dim-witted) thinking that saves the Going Merry from destruction. The crew's daemons are oddly subdued in the whale's overbearing presence, but they don't learn why until lonely Laboon and the doctor who cares for him are but specks on the horizon, and it is only then that Luffy has an explanation for why touching the whale's scarred body had felt… strange.</p>
<p>"He's a daemon," Jasper mutters, the first of the daemon-half of the crew to speak up. "But not Crocus'. He must have gotten <em>separated </em>from his…" The fox shivers, appalled with the very thought of Laboon's desperate wailing, but as Jasper tucks himself into the safety of Nami's side, he startles with the recollection that Luffy's daemon is one that the crew have never seen.</p>
<p>The rest of the crew seem to realise this at the same time, but nobody goes as far as to mention it. Luffy wouldn't mind it if they did; it's not as if he's keeping a <em>secret</em>. Rather, he keeps quiet merely because he still hears the whispers whenever they go ashore, whispers of <em>daemon-killer</em> and worse, and though he loves his nakama dearly, he fears that they wouldn't understand the decision that some make to eat a Devil Fruit.</p>
<p>Not, that is, that Luffy had a choice about his.</p>
<p>With Reverse Mountain and Laboon soon behind them, the crew encounter the island of Whiskey Peak and the ruckus occurring there. Well, the ruckus doesn't occur <em>until</em> they arrive, but the Straw Hat crew are quickly learning that this will always be the way; without hardship they cannot progress, and without challenges they cannot lift their heads with pride.</p>
<p>(They'll shout, <em>our captain will be the King of the Pirates</em>, and one day the entire world will hear them).</p>
<p>The lateness of the hour does nothing to dampen the spirits of the people living in the town. Welcoming and open, they encourage the Straw Hat crew to drink and eat to their hearts' content, and the crew are eager to take them up on the offer. Free food and drink are not things to be passed on lightly, so Luffy leads his crew of merriment and glee through the dusty streets, stopping only to marvel at the gigantic cacti that cast their thorny shadows over the town.</p>
<p>"Ooh, Zoro, someone's just opened a bottle of Alabastian Straight Bourbon <em>Falcon Whiskey</em>," Pax says, excitement building as she sniffs the air. "I think it's Number Nine - or <em>Seven</em>. I hope it's Seven, that one's my favourite."</p>
<p>"Should go find it," Zoro grunts, hand resting on the hilts of his katana in an almost lazy fashion, but Luffy knows that he could draw any of those blades without a second's hesitation. "I'm sure they'd be happy to share, hmm?"</p>
<p>"Depends on your definition of <em>share</em>," Nami says, and Zoro laughs, agreeing with her wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>The rest of the crew follow the townspeople to drink and eat long into the night, Zoro and Pax soon returning with the fabled bottle of whiskey. By the turn of midnight, the Straw Hat pirates are strewn about the sofas and tables sleeping soundly, bellies full and bulging. The people of Whiskey Peak plot around them, muttering and scheming over the oblivious crew: maybe it is this that wakes Luffy, or maybe it is something else, he wonders, sticking his head out the door at the sound of wings rushing in the night.</p>
<p>He doesn't call out to the sound.</p>
<p>Instead, he can only plod through the streets at the urging to his gut, his instincts alone pushing him along. In the open lane, many of the villagers are lying stone-cold on the ground, pistols and knives scattered about them, and Luffy rushes to each person he finds to see them bruised and cut - and then, just a few, with their clothes shredded by claws.</p>
<p>Zoro and Pax.</p>
<p><em>Drunk?</em> he ponders, thinking of the whiskey. <em>Uninhibited?</em> he dares not think, the Baratie not long behind them. Mihawk's presence had revealed a side of Zoro that Luffy had only glimpsed before, something dangerous, something worthy of the wolf at his side.</p>
<p><em>Or is this justified?</em> Luffy reasons, sure of Zoro's loyalty and Pax's gentle heart. Hemming and hawing to himself, the captain leans over his rubbery belly to inspect the slice of Pax's claws, and beneath his hand the townsman breathes.</p>
<p>
  <em>Alive.</em>
</p>
<p>Luffy releases a breath, steel tension sighing out of his body. The man on the pavement stirs, twitching into consciousness, and so Luffy sits back on his heels to let him, waiting like a coil to have his hopes confirmed.</p>
<p>The moment the man lays eyes on Luffy, he curses, wheezes, and startles violently enough to scrap the gravel, and that's all the answer Luffy needs.</p>
<p>"Hey, hey, thanks for the food, that was <em>awesome</em>," he singsongs, smiling mischievously at the villager, and nervously, like a mouse cowering from a cat, the man quirks his mouth in something of a smile.</p>
<p>Luffy punches him.</p>
<p>Then, delighted with the <em>crack</em> of bone and the <em>crunch </em>of teeth, the straw-hatted captain springs off to join his wayward first mate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Carue is an even bigger daemon than Zeff's Arabella, but he exemplifies the notion that <em>bigger isn't always better</em> - or fiercer, as the case may be. A super spot-billed duck of a sunshine yellow disposition, Carue is a joy to have on the ship - nervy, but kind, playful and sweet, and standing almost as tall as his other half. Vivi is a new light within the crew, a princess of pearls and blues with a heart strong and gold. Soft-spoken, at first, a little shy around the Straw Hats, but driven by ideals and promises with an enthusiasm that Luffy can appreciate. Vivi is proud of her beliefs, her country and her people, so Luffy knows that she will succeed in saving the citizens she so dearly loves.</p>
<p>And they will help her, or they will die trying.</p>
<p><em>Luffy's</em> ideals will accept nothing else.</p>
<p>"Guess we'll have to step-up our training," Sanji concludes as the plan to overthrow the Baroque Works is laid out. Dinner has long-since finished, the chef now only polishing the glasses to busy his hands.</p>
<p>"Guess we'll need a <em>doctor</em>," Usopp mutters, his grumble wobbling the surface of his hot chocolate. A touch of the whipped cream is still dotted by his mouth, but he has yet to notice why Luffy and Wilhelmina keep sniggering.</p>
<p>"A doctor wouldn't be a bad idea," Nami agrees, slurping her own drink. "We've been lucky so far, but now that the crew's getting bigger, we really need someone who knows what they're doing."</p>
<p>"<em>Zoro's</em> been lucky so far," Jasper amends.</p>
<p>The wolfdog curled beside the other end of the table reveals her teeth. "You insinuating that we get by on <em>luck</em>?" she warns, and Jasper, realising that he has misspoke - realising that he has challenged Pax's <em>pride</em> - flattens his ears under her heavy stare. Carue, too, startles at the wolfdog's snarl, unused to both the occasional break of Pax's self-imposed silence and the daemon's noteworthy set of fangs.</p>
<p>"Pax, that wasn't what he meant," Morgandy whispers, attempting to soothe the wolfdog before she starts to growl. Usually so level-headed as she is, her temper on such a long-fuse, Pax's anger is an emotion they seldom wish to evoke.</p>
<p>"Got a point though," Sanji says under his breath.</p>
<p>"Speak up, cook," Zoro calls, and Wilhelmina does actually get as far as opening their mouth before Sanji hushes his acquiescent daemon. Zoro huffs (<em>I thought so</em>, it seems to say) and then reaches down to ruffle Pax's fur to calm her.</p>
<p>"A doctor would be cool!" Luffy exclaims, feeling the need to make his opinion known as an awkward pause arises.</p>
<p>His crew sigh around him, clearly having expected nothing else, but the tension lifts as they return to their drinks. The following lull in conversation is comfortable, human and daemon relaxed side-by-side, the quiet broken only by the sounds of their mugs clunking against the tabletop.</p>
<p>"You think <em>everything</em> is cool," Nami eventually remarks, giving Luffy's smile a pointed look.</p>
<p>He denies her with a pout, causing the navigator's eyebrows to rise dubiously.</p>
<p>"Only the <em>cool things</em>," he insists, and Vivi laughs louder than them all.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Halfway to Alabasta, disaster strikes, Nami deathly ill for a reason they cannot fathom, and the need for a doctor becomes more pressing than ever. They all do what they can, Usopp and Vivi exhausting all the medical knowledge they have at Nami's bedside, and Sanji working tirelessly in the kitchen to cater for their sickly navigator, but Nami and Jasper only continue to worsen.</p>
<p>They change Merry's course to the legendary island of Drum and hope whoever they find there will be enough to cure their nakama.</p>
<p>Zoro and Pax pick up the watch shifts - day and night, any that they can manage. The ship is vulnerable without its navigator, threatened by the Grand Line's erratic weather now more than ever, and Luffy cannot make heads or tails of Nami's maps and notes. Vivi steps up to the challenge with her sleeves rolled up, expression nervous but firm, hair sweaty and as windswept as the sky she tries to predict; a navigator she is not, but together with Zoro at the helm and Usopp as their eyes, the Merry safely traverses the seas.</p>
<p>For the most part, at least. Luffy soon discovers that a temporary navigator with the weight of her country and the lives of the Straw Hat crew on her shoulders, and <em>Roronoa Zoro</em> at the helm, is a match that runs a high risk of catastrophe. Truthfully, it is just as entertaining as it is disastrous, but with hailstones the size of buildings and water that sizzles like acid raining down on them, there are more important things to worry about.</p>
<p>" - <em>starboard</em>?" Zoro roars at one such time, full weight shoved against the steering pole in a desperate fight to keep the ship on course. Pax is half-drowned but steady at his side, and across the ship Vivi is hollering directions at them, Luffy and Usopp doing all they can to protect the sails.</p>
<p>"Starboard means <em>nothing</em> to me!"</p>
<p>"<em>Right</em>, Zoro, rig - I SAID RIGHT."</p>
<p>The steering pole rocks to the side, the ship swaying with it. Waves crash and pour over the deck, the storm drowning out Zoro's answering shout:</p>
<p>"That <em>was</em> right!"</p>
<p>Carue cries out, skidding across the deck to shield Vivi from the next wave.</p>
<p>"<em>No</em>!" the princess bellows from within her daemon's daffodil coat, spitting feathers from her mouth. "That was <em>LEFT</em>! USE YOUR HANDS."</p>
<p>"Wha - I'M <em>HOLDING</em> THE GODDAMN LEVER, OF COURSE I'M USING MY HANDS."</p>
<p>"L FOR LEFT!"</p>
<p>"L for <em>lost</em>," Luffy hears Usopp despair, and the captain is helpless not to laugh.</p>
<p>Afterwards, when the sea has rolled to calm again, an exhausted Vivi offers the swordsman a bow that she almost doesn't have the strength to rise from, and Zoro is so thrown for a second that he stomps right on Pax's tail.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry I shouted at you," Vivi says, sodden hair dripping over her face and shoes.</p>
<p>"Eh, sometimes I deserve to be shouted at," is all Zoro has to say to that, rubbing the back of his neck. Pax whimpers at his feet, fussing over her tail, and both swordsman and princess smile despite how close to death they had come.</p>
<p>"Do you think Sanji-san would be kind enough to put a pot of tea on?" Vivi asks.</p>
<p>"Well, he will for <em>you</em>," Zoro replies, but he follows the princess and her daemon into the lounge anyway. He pauses only to shake out his hair like a dog, and when Luffy drops inside just a little later with a towel around his shoulders, all of them are sitting there - Zoro, Vivi, Sanji, and daemons - with half-empty mugs sitting beside them.</p>
<p>"Hey, hey Sanji," Luffy calls, interrupting the quiet conversation at the table. "When's dinner gonna be?"</p>
<p>The chef sits back in his chair with his arms crossed, but in the chair next to him, Wilhelmina squeaks a cheerful noise as Luffy coos over the prospect of dinner.</p>
<p>"Soon, so pipe down," Sanji says, the way Wilhelmina's eyes peep over the tabletop detracting from the chef's apathetic grunt. The sea otter's presence means he is <em>ridiculously </em>easy to read, and Luffy grins as he swipes a couple of biscuits from the table and plops one into Wilhelmina's paws.</p>
<p>"I have to say, I've never seen a group of daemons so comfortable around other people," Vivi muses with a note of awe, Carue's curiosity revealing her own as the daemon sniffs at Luffy's hand. "How long have you been sailing together? Years?"</p>
<p>"Couple weeks," Sanji admits.</p>
<p>"Months," Zoro adds.</p>
<p>"Zoro and Pax joined me at Shells," Luffy provides, still swiping the biscuits as though his crew aren't acutely aware of this. "They were first - then Nami and Jasper, and then Usopp and Morgandy. Sanji and Wilhelmina were before you! Neat, right? I've got an awesome crew!"</p>
<p>Vivi blushes faintly at being included, Carue's feathers ruffling beside her, but Luffy's compliment hardly seems to faze the other members of the crew, long used to the captain's declarations of affection. That doesn't mean they <em>aren't</em> the tiniest bit flattered, and Luffy grins as both Pax and Wilhelmina nudge their respective partners into nearly spilling their tea.</p>
<p>"Shells? Shells Town?" Sanji echoes, abandoning his drink to hide his embarrassment behind a cigarette instead. "Wasn't there an explosion or something back there recently? That was <em>you</em>?"</p>
<p>"<em>Technically</em>, the marine base," Zoro deadpans, and crumbs splatter over the table as Luffy laughs.</p>
<p>Howls of the wind picking up outside interrupt their chatter; by this point, another pot of tea has been poured, even the daemons appreciating the calm of the storm ("<em>Luffy</em>, if I see you trying to give Willa caffeine again, don't expect to get seconds at dinner.") but the Grand Line waits for nobody.</p>
<p>"Is there anyone out there watching the weather?" Sanji eventually asks, an unctuous denial of Vivi's offer to help with the dishes swiftly replacing his sombre expression. "It's okay, Vivi-san, don't worry yourself -"</p>
<p>"I want to help, it's the least I can do."</p>
<p>"But -"</p>
<p>"I insist, Sanji-san, please."</p>
<p>"<em>Ah</em>," Luffy utters, trying not to smile at the hushed conversation to the left ("It's like having another Nami on the ship," Pax mumbles, and Zoro replies with a laughed, "I don't think Nami knows the word <em>please</em>.").</p>
<p>"I think Usopp's checking up on Nami," the captain says with a shrug, which is a <em>no</em> if the crew ever heard one.</p>
<p>"I'll go," Zoro volunteers, chugging the last of his drink. He cringes at the taste, lukewarm and entirely his fault, then bends to remove a towel from Pax's back and throws it over the top of the chair, scooping up his katana as he passes.</p>
<p>Luffy watches them go until the lounge door clicks shut behind Pax's gentle steps, listen to Sanji and Vivi's half-hearted argument of pleasantries, and then bounces out after man and wolf, calling, "Zoro, Pax - Zoro!"</p>
<p>The first mate stills, earrings chiming together as he turns to address the holler. "What?" he grunts, side-stepping just in time to avoid a rubbery bodyslam from the captain. Yet, the missed opportunity doesn't deter Luffy for long; a second later he has his arms wound around Zoro's stomach twice-fold, wiggling gleefully as the other man tries to worm away.</p>
<p>"Can I do the watch with you?" Luffy pleas into the sweaty, rain-soaked depths of Zoro's shirt. Pax is sat just a foot away, one ear flopped forwards as though she cannot decide how to react, and when Luffy blinks excessively innocently at her, she only blinks back.</p>
<p>Zoro shrugs one shoulder, the gesture about the most he can do. "Sure, whatever. Don't fall in."</p>
<p>(<em>Let me go</em>, he doesn't say).</p>
<p>(<em>Let him go</em>, Pax doesn't say).</p>
<p>Luffy laughs his signature laugh and gives his first mate another squeeze. "You'll catch me!" he says, of this he has no doubt. A Devil Fruit user though he may be, Luffy does not fear his entrapment on the Merry; Zoro has never failed to have his back, be it on land or within the throws of the sea.</p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah," Zoro drawls, meaning a promise of <em>always</em> and a sigh of <em>but you don't make it easy for me</em>, which Luffy snickers at, knowing that to be true. "Just as well that Pax and I can be so far apart, huh?"</p>
<p>"Nami'd complain about the <em>wet dog</em> smell if I went in after you," Pax points out, and Zoro smirks, ruffling the daemon's head roughly as he leads the trio up towards the figurehead.</p>
<p>"Doesn't it hurt?" Luffy asks, interrupting their bickering to consider the pair them curiously. Pax <em>has</em> always moved fairly independently from Zoro, lounging in her own space even far out of sight, but he supposes when comparing her to the other daemons aboard the ship, the extent to which she and Zoro can walk apart is bizarre. Morgandy, for example, remains close to Usopp at all times, but maybe her size and temperament play a factor in her willingness to roam the outer reaches of their bond.</p>
<p>"We trained for it," Zoro answers, which is probably more of a <em>yes</em> than a <em>no</em>.</p>
<p>"Axe-man keeping Pax away hurt you," Luffy remembers, visualising that fateful meeting all those months ago. Zoro had been tired, beaten, and half-starved, yes, but it had been his daemon that he had called for - not sleep, respite, or food.</p>
<p>"There's a limit. We're not <em>separated</em>," Zoro admits, plonking himself down at the bow for a long, restless watch. Pax curls herself down beside him, shaggy head almost poking through the gaps in the banister. He doesn't say anymore, doesn't ask the obvious question, doesn't turn the conversation onto Luffy, onto the daemon that should be here, and Luffy is grateful for that. The captain springs himself up onto the banister above Pax, letting his legs swing over the open water, and maybe it is Zoro's silence that encourages him to answers for once - to finally explains this <em>not-secret</em> that his crew have never asked for.</p>
<p>"I am," he says, the subsequent moment of silence filling in the word. "From my daemon."</p>
<p>Zoro is quiet for a moment, acting as if he hasn't heard his captain, or maybe giving Luffy the option to continue, if he wants. But Luffy doesn't, allowing his nakama to choose whatever question he wants to ask - if Zoro even wants to ask any, that is - because he'll answer it, he realises, if Zoro is the one to ask.</p>
<p>"When you ate your Devil Fruit?" the first mate asks, and Luffy smiles because that's an <em>easy</em> question to answer; a question that doesn't hurt as much as some could, a question closely tied to happy memories of Makino and Foosha and Shanks.</p>
<p>"Yeah. I didn't know what it was when I ate it though! Shanks was really mad!" Luffy laughs, maybe understating that a <em>little bit</em>, and Zoro's solemn expression is momentarily eradicated by total surprise.</p>
<p>"Red-Haired Shanks?" he blurts, Pax rumbling, <em>what, really?</em> at his side.</p>
<p>Luffy nods, gesturing to Shanks' gift for emphasis. "Yeah! He gave me this hat, you know? We're going to give it back when I become the Pirate King."</p>
<p>"<em>We're</em>?"</p>
<p>"Me and Raquel," Luffy confirms, feeling a twinge of longing (of melancholy and glee) at the sound of his daemon's name dropping from his tongue. He hasn't uttered her name since the Baratie, but back then it had only been in passing, Mihawk's entrance having distracted Usopp from considering the significance of the name.</p>
<p>"All of us," he amends. "We're all going to be there."</p>
<p>Zoro's stillness is prolonged, even Pax unmoved as the Merry rocks beneath them, Luffy's declaration impelling them to silence. Luffy can only guess as to what is going through their minds; he understands his swordsman well - he <em>knows</em> he does - but there's something in Zoro's eyes that he hasn't seen before.</p>
<p>(Or maybe he's just never stopped to think about Zoro looks at him).</p>
<p>"So it's bollocks then, what they say?" is what the swordsman concludes, audacious as <em>hell</em> and raising one, severe eyebrow at the rubberman above him, and Luffy - laughs.</p>
<p>God<em>damn</em>, Raquel's going to like Zoro a lot.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Drum's resident daemon-less Devil Fruit user, a reindeer with a blue nose who some call "monster" and some call "son", introduces himself as <em>Chopper</em>, a doctor with a little voice and a big heart. In Luffy's opinion, Chopper is one of the coolest people he has ever met (because only <em>cool</em> things are cool), but if he were to ask the rest of the crew, they'd probably just coo and swoon.</p>
<p>"He is pretty cute," Usopp remarks, Morgandy squeaking a helpless agreement.</p>
<p>Sanji just huffs around a cigarette. "Yeah, for <em>emergency food supply</em>."</p>
<p>Chopper's lack of a daemon does draw unwanted attention from the townspeople, but the Straw Hat pirates hardly bat an eyelash, long-since accustomed to their captain's solitary life. Questions <em>are</em> raised though, both to the woman that Chopper considers family and to Chopper himself, but if the crew are discomforted to learn that their newest nakama never <em>had</em> a daemon to "kill" in the first place ("He <em>is</em> a reindeer, you know.") then this doesn't change how smitten they are over his tiny hooves and ears and bubblegum pink hat.</p>
<p>Only Luffy asks, <em>what's that like?</em> and Chopper just blinks his endearingly large eyes and fusses over the brim of his hat, muttering back, <em>what's it like for you?</em></p>
<p>Luffy grins, conceding to the point, and <em>bops</em> the reindeer on the nose.</p>
<p>Something in the crew begins to change after that - although, it isn't until Vivi has retaken her country and Robin has tricked, bartered, and saved Luffy's life to earn herself a place on the crew, that Luffy notices.</p>
<p>He notices it in the way that, when Usopp paints, both Morgandy and Jasper sit and watch him; when Sanji and Zoro bicker, Wilhelmina sticks out their tongue and Pax laughs; and when Nami shows Chopper how to tend to her tangerine trees, Jasper and Pax can be heard sniping at each other, joking together, hissing and growling in good spirits, and as Nami admonishes Jasper for being too loud, she admonishes Zoro's daemon too.</p>
<p>The taboo not to touch another's daemon still restricts them (the taboo not to scratch Morgandy's head or pet Jasper's tummy, and definitely not to scoop Wilhelmina up or use Pax's fur as a pillow), but the crew are growing closer, the bridge between <em>man</em> and <em>daemon</em> crumbling more and more every day. Vivi was right after all, and seeing his crew and their daemons so merrily interact heartens Luffy - makes him proud to be the captain of this motley group, and proud to have them sail with him to Raftel and beyond.</p>
<p>Robin too - although she is yet to feel comfortable amongst the crew. She immerses herself in her books as though they could protect her, and she hides behind her smiles and the crow's feet around her eyes as though Luffy can't see straight through the façade. Luffy's yet to point this out to her because while Robin may or may not be a lot of things, <em>unobservant</em> she is not, and Luffy trusts her truths <em>and</em> lies, and trusts that she will come to want her place on his crew just as all his nakama did before her.</p>
<p>"Hey, Robin," he says one afternoon, popping a ice lolly out of his mouth to address the woman <em>perched</em> rather than lounged on the sunbed. She's not particularly social by any means, but then neither is Zoro, but he, at least, is a constant presence about the ship, snoozing, training, or generally lying in the way, whereas Robin sets herself apart.</p>
<p>"Yes captain?" she replies, lowering her book but not lifting her sunglasses, unable to be entirely defenceless even in his presence. She's watching him though, a hawk's eye in the shadows, a viper coiled and waiting for reason to strike, so Luffy smiles and waves his ice lolly at her, never wanting to give her that reason.</p>
<p>"Can your daemon reach us at sea?"</p>
<p>He asks <em>can</em> deliberately, not <em>will</em>, and he knows that she, more than anyone else on the crew, will understand this distinction.</p>
<p>"Yes captain," she answers, considering his lazy lapping at the popsicle a moment before deciding to explain. "I consumed my Devil Fruit before he settled, and while I don't have the means to clarify whether there is a causal relationship between the age at which a Devil Fruit is consumed and the daemon's settled form, it is true that my daemon is not land-bound."</p>
<p>"He's free, huh?" Luffy says, nearly missing the ghost of a smile on her lips. "Mine too."</p>
<p>"Then I will consider that evidence towards the matter," Robin replies monotone, returning to her book to end the conversation. Only, Luffy has something he still wishes to say, something he wonders if she still needs to hear, but he lets her dismiss him and continues to enjoy his icy treat for a minute or two.</p>
<p>A page turns over.</p>
<p>"Hey Robin," he begins again, and at her next, ever-patient murmur of, <em>yes captain?</em> Luffy asks, "Do you miss your daemon?"</p>
<p>This time, the archaeologist doesn't lower her novel, but he sees her eyes flick towards him from beneath her tinted shades. He's still smiling; she's not, but then Luffy is aware that this isn't a topic that they've ever felt the need to smile about.</p>
<p>"Dreadfully, captain," Robin admits, flicking through another page of her book to feign disinterest. "Do they call you <em>daemon-killer</em> too?"</p>
<p>Luffy crunches through the tip of the popsicle, and Robin twitches as though worried that she has succeeded in angering him.</p>
<p>"Yeah," he says, calm as he is in the face of the slurs; rage and aggression would only reinforce the hatred towards Devil Fruit users, and while Luffy doesn't care for what people think of him, he cares about Robin, and Chopper, and the safety of the rest of his dearest. "But my crew don't 'cause they're my nakama, and they're your nakama too now. No one here's gonna think any less of you because of how you grew up or anything. Okay?"</p>
<p>Robin seems unsure on what to say, but it's not like he's expecting her life story to come spilling out. Rather, she just nods her assent and returns once again to her book, her privacy, and thoughts, but when Luffy whines upon finishing his snack, she is there with the ice-lolly bucket offering more.</p>
