  <b>Shen Yuan</b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Shen Yuan’s life wasn’t perfect. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He doubted that it was possible to have a perfect life, there were always things that were imperfect. Shen Yuan, for example, had an utterly weak and sickly body. When he was younger he was too weak to leave his room, and even now as a young adult he had to be extremely careful about what he ate, where he went, how much he did, and how long he was out in the elements. His mother and father were wealthy, but never especially doting or present. He was an only child, so growing up he didn’t have any friends, and he spent most of his time reading or practicing the instruments his parents wanted him to learn. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Things began to look up for him when he was a teenager. When he was old enough to have his own laptop and phone, he (perhaps foolishly) entered spaces online in which he could talk to other people. It started off innocently enough, digital chatrooms where he had a cute little avatar. He met his best friend on one such website, Shang Qinghua.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Shang Qinghua was annoying, his typing was sometimes illegible, and his habits were atrocious. They stayed friends for years. He made more friends when he was deemed healthy enough to ender public highschool. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He got good grades, he graduated in high standing in his class, and he got into his college of choice. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Though it was in the summer before he started college where he met the person that would bring his life the closest to perfection that it would ever be: his amazing and wonderful Luo Binghe. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Binghe was incredible. He was almost unreal. He was prettier than any model Shen Yuan had ever seen in his life, he was tall and </span>
  <em>
    <span>built. </span>
  </em>
  <span>It came as no surprise when Binghe told him that he did modeling in order to pay for culinary school. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Culinary school. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Binghe’s cooking was heavenly, the first time Shen Yuan tasted any he wept. Actually wept. Beyond that, he was sweet, kind, and gentle. Even if he was a little clingy at times, Shen Yuan couldn’t bring himself to mind. How could he? This amazing, unreal man had somehow decided that he was in love with weak, nerdy, nitpicky, and spoiled Shen Yuan. It almost didn’t seem real, but any doubts that Shen Yuan would have were quickly put to rest by his Binghe. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>All it would take was a quick glance into his (amazing, beautiful, sparkling, fathomless) eyes, and Shen Yuan could clearly see the love his Binghe had in them. It was there in his eyes, his kisses, his touches, his everything. Shen Yuan would have to be the stupidest man on the planet to doubt Binghe’s feelings for him, and even stupider than that to let this amazing man slip through his fingers. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>For while Binghe was amazing, he had his faults as everyone does. He was easily jealous, he was as sticky as anything, he was </span>
  <em>
    <span>vicious </span>
  </em>
  <span>if insulted, a little overprotective, and his puppy-eyes were far too powerful. Though the </span>
  <em>
    <span>worst </span>
  </em>
  <span>thing, the worst thing?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Binghe was studying abroad. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Far, far away from Shen Yuan. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He </span>
  <em>
    <span>hated it. </span>
  </em>
  <span>He hated it, but he could cope. They video call, they send snapchats, they talk on the phone, they text. There’s no distrust, there’s no lack of communication, as far as long distance went, they were doing very well. Shen Yuan just missed having Binghe near him. Always missed having his Binghe nearby. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Though, there was another problem that came along with their long distance relationship. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Nobody believed Binghe was real!!</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Was his credibility so low?! Was it </span>
  <em>
    <span>so </span>
  </em>
  <span>unrealistic that Shen Yuan could have a boyfriend?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span> Why wouldn’t people believe him!? Binghe is real, goddamnit! </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>Shen Jiu</b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The day he met Shen Yuan, Shen Jiu thought he was short, far too thin, his style was totally outdated, his glasses were so big it was ridiculous, and that he was </span>
  <em>
    <span>cute. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Ugh. He was adorable. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The first time that Shen Yuan looked at Shen Jiu, blinking his pale-green eyes up at him through his thick-rimmed glasses, Shen Jiu was overcome with a bizarre urge to wrap him, this complete and utter stranger, into a hug. Then the stranger smiled at him, and Shen Jiu felt a physical </span>
  <em>
    <span>tug. </span>
  </em>
  <span>What the fuck? What the </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck? </span>
  </em>
  <span>That wasn’t allowed. Shen Jiu panicked, and told Shen Yuan to get out of his seat. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It wasn't even his seat. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was the first day of classes, how would anyone have picked seats yet? Why did he say that? It didn’t end up mattering. Shen Jiu had half-expected him to fold, to get up and apologize profusely like any number of other people he had intimidated. Shen Jiu knew he was scary. He was intimidating on purpose, so that he could get what he wanted without people being putting up too much of a fight. All it would take is a singular glare, and weaker people would bend back and let him do what he wanted. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Shen Yuan </span>
  <em>
    <span>hadn’t. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Shen Yuan had looked up at him, utterly unimpressed. He said, “Sorry, I didn’t know this is your seat, but if you want me to move you should </span>
  <em>
    <span>ask nicer.</span>
  </em>
  <span>” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Shen Jiu was stunned. People scurrying away with squeaking apologies, he was used to. People becoming aggressive and challenging him, he was used to.People belittling and insulting him, he was used to. People (one person) coddling him and acquiesced with a smile to his every whim, he was used to. He was not used to somebody telling him to act </span>
  <em>
    <span>nicer. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It shook him to his core, and he was unable to do anything but revert back onto another fail-safe. He just scoffed and then took the next available seat, right behind Shen Yuan. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Other students slowly began to trickle in, but Shen Jiu couldn’t be bothered to pay attention to any of them. He just kept his gaze fixed on the back of Shen Yuan’s head. The class started, and the professor did the brain-dead nonsense every professor did on the first day of class: stand up, say your name, your major, and give an interesting fact about yourself. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Shen Yuan stood up. “My name is Shen Yuan.” He said, his voice slightly quiet, but not so much to be classified as ‘quiet.’ “My major is media studies, and I was bedridden until I was fourteen years old.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Shen Jiu blinked at him. There were a few sympathetic gasps and murmurs around, and the professor politely (and disinterestedly, what a tool) asked Shen Yuan (</span>
  <em>
    <span>Shen</span>
  </em>
  <span> Yuan, they had the same surname) Shen Yuan explained his illness, and Shen Jiu thought back to the adorable face that had reprimanded him earlier, and was struck again by that </span>
  <em>
    <span>disgusting </span>
  </em>
  <span>desire to coddle the man in front of him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Shen Yuan sat back down, and Shen Jiu stood up. “Shen Jiu.” He said simply, keeping his voice cold and distant. He sat back down. The professor blinked at him. Shen Jiu kept his face impassive, resisting the urge to raise his eyebrows in challenge. That was all he felt like sharing, thank you very much. Move on. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The professor did move on, and the class soon came to an end. Typically, Shen Jiu would stand up and leave the room as soon as possible, but this time something compelled him to linger for a moment. He thought maybe he should.. Try to talk to Shen Yuan. Not apologize, obviously, but. Flirt maybe. Shen Jiu was handsome as hell and honestly he would be doing this shrimp a favor if they were to hook up. Or kiss. Or hold hands. UGH. What the fuck was wrong with him today?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Shen Jiu decided to stop being stupid, and stood up. He slipped his laptop into his shoulder bag and walked past Shen Yuan, making sure to keep his gait quick and his eyes forward. Don’t acknowledge. He was halted though, when a hand suddenly grabbed his wrist. He whipped around fast, ready to dodge a punch should he need to, and roughly yanked his wrist out of the (weak, too weak) grip that it was in. He was met with Shen Yuan’s wide eyes and raised eyebrows. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Uh, hey.” Shen Yuan said, rubbing at his hand. “Sorry, I didn’t want to grab you but I just wanted to say that uh,” he looked down, and bit at his lip. Shen Jiu’s heart fluttered. </span>
  <em>
    <span>He </span>
  </em>
  <span>wanted to bite those lips. Huh. Guess he was crazy now. Whatever. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Go out with me.” Shen Jiu said, his mouth apparently seventeen steps ahead of his brain. What. Ever. He watched as Shen Yuan’s eyes widened even more, and his mouth formed words but made no sound. His face was now bright red, and it was </span>
  <em>
    <span>so cute. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Shen Jiu must have some sort of concussion. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I-uh-?” Shen Yuan stuttered. Shen Jiu smirked. “I’m uh- I’m flattered, but I, uh,  have a boyfriend?” He said, his voice sounding unsure at the last part. Huh, so that was how he was going to play it? </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Sure you do.” Shen Jiu said, raising his eyebrows. Shen Yuan’s brow furrowed. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“What’s up with that response? I do.” Shen Jiu watched as he pulled out his phone and opened it. He tapped around for a moment, before he turned an image of a completely unreasonably handsome man towards Shen Jiu. Really, if he wanted to go for the fake boyfriend angle, he should have chosen some pictures that weren't </span>
  <em>
    <span>obviously </span>
  </em>
  <span>glamour shots of some model. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Fake boyfriend or not, Shen Jiu decided that he hated that stupid pretty face on the phone. This was the kind of person Shen Yuan liked, huh? Well it wasn’t Shen Jiu so it was the wrong choice, and this stranger on the phone was a filthy beast. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Do you mind if I take a better look?” Shen Jiu asked, holding his palm out flat. Shen Yuan smiled and placed the phone in his hand. Shen Jiu didn’t take a closer look at the mongrel on the screen, instead he tapped his merry way into Shen Yuan’s contacts and quickly memorized his number, as well as entering his own number. He handed it back to Shen Yuan who looked aghast. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“When should I pick you up?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You-! What?!” Shen Yuan sputtered, his face darkening even more. “You can’t just-! Do that! Wha-” Shen Jiu placed his hand against Shen Yuan’s mouth, quietly thrilling at the feeling of his lips under his fingertips. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Relax. We’re in the same class, it won’t hurt you to have a friend.” He gave his most winning smile, and inwardly preened when he saw Shen Yuan shyly avert his eyes. “When should I pick you up?” He asked again. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Shen Yuan shook his head slightly. “I won’t go on a date with you. I </span>
  <em>
    <span>have a boyfriend.” </span>
  </em>
  <span>Shen Jiu was about to chime in, say that even if he did (even though he didn’t) it wouldn’t matter, but Shen Yuan continued, “But I think you need more friends. So I’ll agree to hang out with you.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Shen Jiu blinked. That wasn’t… what he expected to hear. He felt himself scowl, and was ready to tear into Shen Yuan, how </span>
  <em>
    <span>dare</span>
  </em>
  <span> he imply he needed more friends--</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>then Shen Yuan laughed, bringing his hand up to his mouth. His eyes crinkled and his cheeks </span>
  <em>
    <span>dimpled </span>
  </em>
  <span>and Shen Jiu lost his marbles. All of his anger flew out the window. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ah, haha, sorry!” Shen Yuan apologized. “Sorry, that was rude.” His laughter faded, and Shen Jiu had already forgotten what he was mad about. He stared dumbly at the other man (dear god what had the once proud Shen Jiu been reduced to and so </span>
  <em>
    <span>quickly</span>
  </em>
  <span>), as Shen Yuan checked the shiny black watch on his wrist. “Oh, man, I’ve got to go. I’ll see you around Shen Jiu-”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Jiu-ge.” Shen Jiu said. Shen Yuan looked slightly surprised, before ducking his head and nodding, his ears stained with a fetching blush. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“J-Jiu-ge.” Shen Yuan cleared his throat. “You should go to class too. Don’t try to bully anyone out of their seat.” He said, his voice fast. He then walked briskly away, leaving Shen Jiu staring after him.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Since that day, Shen Jiu had tried every trick in the book to seduce Shen Yuan, fully embracing the fact that he must have gone completely insane. He invited him to fancy restaurants, paying for his meal, enjoying conversations over candlelight. He would dress in his most alluring clothes, clothes that he </span>
  <em>
    <span>knows </span>
  </em>
  <span>drive people wild. He would lean in close to Shen Yuan, whisper innuendos in his ear, and Shen Yuan </span>
  <em>
    <span>didn’t get the hint. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He never reciprocated, never even indicated that he understood what was happening. The only indication that Shen Yuan had a romantic bone in his body was when he would coo at pictures of his fake boyfriend on his phone. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Shen Jiu could appreciate his… dedication, to the fake boyfriend farce, but it was also (and he means this with love) kind of pathetic. And dumb. The vastly more handsome, and most importantly, the vastly more </span>
  <em>
    <span>real </span>
  </em>
  <span>Shen Jiu was practically offering himself to Shen Yuan on a silver platter, and the man was too lost in his charade (Shen Jiu had entertained the idea of delusion as well) that he didn’t notice. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was enough to drive a man mad. At least Shen Jiu wasn’t alone in his suffering. He found solace in that. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>Mu Qingfang</b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mu Qingfang is in love with a man with thin wrists, shiny black hair, bright eyes, and an even brighter smile. Mu Qingfang is in love with a man with a </span>
  <em>
    <span>stunning </span>
  </em>
  <span>laugh, the kindest heart, terrible sleeping habits, and more terrible taste in literature. Mu Qingfang is in love with a man who has a fake boyfriend. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mu Qingfang knows that  he’s not the most… exciting man available. He’s a busy pre-med student with a botany hobby, who has a strict sleeping schedule and a rather rigid code of morals he lives by. He doesn’t drink, he dresses modestly, and he stays away from cigarettes and he could not be found at any party with more than ten people.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He wasn’t horrible to look at, he would call himself above average if asked, but he certainly wasn’t comparable to the untouchable beauty of Shen Jiu or Liu Qingge, and he certainly wasn’t even within the same </span>
  <em>
    <span>realm </span>
  </em>
  <span>of comparison with the man Shen Yuan gazes at on his phone screen. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His ‘boyfriend,’ Luo Binghe. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Now, Qingfang isn’t one to cast doubt on people without good reason. He considers himself a very trusting and open person. He’s studying to be a doctor after all, he has to be open and accepting of things that people tell him. Though it also means that he draws judgement based on observations that he makes. Really, he wanted to believe Shen Yuan… he really did.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Luo Binghe, from the pictures Shen Yuan had shown him, was a genuine model. A real model. Shen Yuan had no pictures of the two of them, no pictures of Luo Binghe beyond those that are shared publicly, and no evidence of their relationship beyond his words. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Of course, Mu Qingfang should believe him. He should, but he also knew the reason why a person would pretend to be in a relationship. It kept unwanted suitors away, some people used it as a coping mechanism, and some people were genuinely deluded into believing that they were in a relationship. With Shen Yuan, Mu Qingfang suspected it was to keep unwanted suitors away. The man did have quite a few, after all. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There was the forthright and tenacious Shen Jiu, who shamelessly and blatantly tried to seduce Shen Yuan every chance he had, Liu Qingge, who tried to make up for his lack of skills with words with gifts and showy demonstration, and of course, Mu Qingfang himself. There were others of course, many of whom gave up after the first ‘I have a boyfriend.’ As most people would. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mu Qingfang was one such person initially. He had grown close with Shen Yuan, the other man making regular appearances in the on-campus clinic for checkups, and as well as taking care of the frequently injured Liu Qingge, and his accident-prone roommate Shang Qinghua. As such, Mu Qingfang was aware of this "boyfriend" before he had asked Shen Yuan on a date, and once he learned Shen Yuan was taken he was content to let the matter be. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He did so, until it became apparent that Luo Binghe wasn't real. After he realized it, Mu Qingfang figured that if Shen Yuan wasn’t telling him the truth, he must not be close enough to Shen Yuan for him to trust him with that information. He would simply attempt to endear himself to Shen Yuan in the meantime.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He by no means wanted to manipulate or trick Shen Yuan, he would simply go about his daily routine, nothing special. He would just buy Shen Yuan healthy snacks from time to time, give him shoulder massages, discuss his (terrible) media recommendations, and help him with his homework. Nothing outrageous. Nothing weird. Just normal… friend things. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He couldn't lie to himself like that. He was no better than Shen Jiu. He just wanted to be close to the person he loved, and it wasn’t as if he was doing anything… </span>
  <em>
    <span>wrong. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Shen Yuan was single, even if Shen Yuan didn’t know that Mu Qingfang knew.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Still… God must have sent Shen Yuan as some sort of test. A beautiful, delightful, aggravating test of Mu Qingfang’s willpower. He was a patient man, but he was a mortal man nonetheless. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I miss Binghe’s cooking…” Shen Yuan muttered, nibbling on a dried pineapple. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mu Qingfang pressed down too hard on this pencil, causing the lead to snap. He brushed it away, not taking his eyes away from the utterly adorable pouting expression on Shen Yuan’s face. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Does… Luo Binghe cook?”Mu Qingfang asked, keeping his voice level. Shen Yuan’s eyes snapped up to meet Mu Qingfang's own, his expression surprised. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I said that out loud?” Shen Yuan asked, a blush slowly blooming on his pale face. Qingfang nodded. Shen Yuan rubbed the back of his neck. “Ah, sorry Qingfang-ge. I don’t mean to imply that I don’t enjoy the snacks you brought me.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mu Qingfang shook his head with an honest smile. “There’s no need to apologize. I didn’t take any offense.” Shen Yuan smiled and nodded. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“It’s just that Binghe is an </span>
  <em>
    <span>amazing </span>
  </em>
  <span>cook.” Shen Yuan said, his eyes glittering with excitement. “He can cook </span>
  <em>
    <span>anything, </span>
  </em>
  <span>from anywhere, and when he gets a recipe wrong, the next time he tries he gets it perfect. It’s so fucking good, I’ve never tasted anything like it. Nothing that I’ve had since the last meal he made me has tasted even half as good.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Normally, Qingfang would smile and listen to Shen Yuan’s passionate rants with a deep contentment and affection, but this time he couldn’t help the small furrow that appeared on his brow. Shen Yuan had never really spoken about Luo Binghe to him before. He had figured it was because there was no reason for Shen Yuan to keep up the pretense around him, but </span>
  <em>
    <span>now </span>
  </em>
  <span>Qingfang was wondering if he has miss-stepped somehow. Why would Shen Yuan feel the need to bring up his fake boyfriend now?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Qingfang-ge?” Mu Qingfang blinked as Shen Yuan waved a hand in front of his face. Shen Yuan laughed as Mu Qingfang snapped back to attention. “Where’d you go?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Mu Qingfang grabbed Shen Yuan’s hand in his own before he could pull it away. “Have I made you uncomfortable, A-Yuan?” He asked, wanting to get to the bottom of his worries. Shen Yuan tilted his head as an expression of confusion flitted across his face. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Uh, no?” He answered, blinking his big eyes at him. His glasses slipped down his nose a bit, and Mu Qingfang unconsciously righted them for him, letting go of his hand. “Why would you think that?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Qingfang shook his head, a self-deprecating smile slipping onto his face. He had undoubtedly miss-stepped in some way, but if Shen Yuan wasn’t willing to discuss it, he wouldn’t press the issue. “Sorry A-Yuan, I think I’m just a little stressed.” He hoped the (absolutely truth, he was stressed all the time, help him god please) lie would be enough to end the line of questioning. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well then.” Shen Yuan said, pulling himself on top of the table that was in between them. Qingfang’s eyes widened in surprise as Shen Yuan slid himself across the surface of the table (they were in his kitchen, so there was nobody around to see, but still!) and then slipped into the chair next to him. Qingfang fought off the blush that was threatening to spill onto his face as Shen Yuan scooted the chair he dropped into closer to him, close enough that their arms were touching. “What’s it this week?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It took a second for Mu Qingfang’s brain to reboot. “I-It’s autoimmune diseases.” He said, tapping his eraser against the wall of words in his text. Shen Yuan stuck out his tongue in distaste, and Qingfang found himself having to avert his eyes to avoid staring. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Not fun.” He said simply, distaste coloring his voice. He tapped at the book, and turned a </span>
  <em>
    <span>blinding </span>
  </em>
  <span>smile to Mu Qingfang, who was utterly helpless in the face of it. He couldn’t fight the blush now, and let it come freely. What else could he do, when faced with such a stunning sight. “I think you’re amazing, Qingfang-ge.” He said, and Mu Qingfang choked. Shen Yuan carried on, not noticing. He looked down at the textbook, his smile dimming. “After everything I have to deal with because of my condition, I can’t stand reading anything medical for long periods of time. It upsets me, you know? But you’re dedicating your life to </span>
  <em>
    <span>helping </span>
  </em>
  <span>people like me who can’t help themselves.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Qingfang could only nod. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You put up with all this shit, all of these </span>
  <em>
    <span>words, </span>
  </em>
  <span>all of these crazy specific treatments and parts of the body.”He looked back to Qingfang, and his eyes were moist. “I wouldn’t be alive if it weren’t for people like you, Qingfang-ge, so if there’s anything I can do to help you, you have to let me know. Got it?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Blinking back his own tears, when had that happened, Mu Qingfang nodded again, clearing his throat that had become stopped up. If he was in love before, now he was utterly </span>
  <em>
    <span>fucked. </span>
  </em>
  <span>It was completely unfair for Shen Yuan to do this to him, to express his genuine admiration and offer to help, while looking at him with a smile </span>
  <em>
    <span>like that </span>
  </em>
  <span>and teary eyes. It was enough to drive a man mad. Qingfang was nearly there already, and Shen Yuan was rapidly sending him right towards insanity. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>They studied for an hour or two after that, Qingfang far more invested with Shen Yuan at his side, shamefully eager to impress him with his dedication and knowledge, perhaps showboating his knowledge as much as he could. It wasn’t his fault that whenever he did so, Shen Yuan would say ‘woah,’ with starry eyes. </span>
  <em>
    <span>For him. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>When they had completed the chapter, Shen Yuan stretched, raising his arms high above his head and stretching his legs out, curling his toes. Mu Qingfang averted his eyes when he noticed the action caused his sweater to rise up slightly, exposing some of his pale stomach. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“A-Yuan,” Mu Qingfang said carefully, his voice wavering ever-so-slightly. “You know you don’t have to hide anything from me.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Shen Yuan nodded absently, checking his phone. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“If..” He paused, considering his words. “If you ever… break up, with Luo Binghe, know that I’ll be here.” He took a deep breath. That was about as obvious as he could make it without making it totally obvious. “Even if you just need somebody to keep others away, I’d be more than happy to help.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He held his breath as Shen Yuan looked at him. His face went through a journey of emotions. First he seemed surprised, then confused, before settling somewhere between disbelieving and aggravated. Mu Qingfang felt a chill run down his back. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You-” uh oh. “You don’t think Binghe is real either?!” He yelled, slamming his hands down onto his thighs. Qingfang flinched back, surprised by the response, he also felt a bolt of concern, did Shen Yuan hurt himself? “Binghe’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>real!” </span>
  </em>
  <span>Shen Yuan grabbed his phone, and held it into Mu Qingfang’s face. The lock screen was a selfie of Luo Binghe, unreasonably handsome as he ever was. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Of course he’s real-” He started, but was cut off. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“He’s my </span>
  <em>
    <span>real boyfriend!” </span>
  </em>
  <span>Shen Yuan yelled, his face turning red in anger, and his breathing becoming labored. Right. Time to admit defeat. Qingfang placed his hands on Shen Yuan’s shoulders. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I know, A-Yuan.” He lied, attempting to calm him down so he wouldn’t hurt himself. “I meant what I said and nothing else. I know… you and Luo Binghe are very in love, and I don’t think anything will happen, but if it does, you have me. Just as I know I have you.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh.”  Shen Yuan still looked skeptical. “Okay. Sorry.” </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Mu Qingfang didn’t sleep that night. He stayed up researching Erotomania. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>Liu Qingge</b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Shen Yuan was insane, but Liu Qingge wanted to kiss him anyway. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He wanted to bury his nose in his soft and sweet-smelling hair, he wanted to kiss those small hands and their calloused fingertips, he wanted to hug the warm and small body close to his own, he wanted to kiss those pink lips, he wanted to do push-ups with him on his back to increase his resistance, and he wanted to do… other things too. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Yeah. Other things. Things that his sister wrote about in those journals of hers. Things that happen in private. Those things. The sex things. Liu Qinnge wanted to do the sex things to Shen Yuan, who was a certified crazy person. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Maybe that made Liu Qingge a crazy person, too. He didn’t really care if he was or not. As long as he could still do martial arts he could be as crazy as he wanted to be. Really, as long as he could still do martial arts he could do anything he wanted. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He couldn’t do the </span>
  <em>
    <span>person </span>
  </em>
  <span>he wanted, but that was because, as he may have mentioned, Shen Yuan was crazy. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Shen Yuan had a fake boyfriend. Which, okay, there were lots of people with fake boyfriends. There were lots of people whose boyfriends were fake, too. Shen Yuan fell into both of those categories. He carried around pictures of “Luo Binghe,” and talked about him as if he was his actual boyfriend. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Liu Qingge had never actually seen Shen Yuan interact with “Luo Binghe,” however, and Liu Qingge may not know a lot (anything) about relationships, but you were supposed to talk to your boyfriend. You were supposed to ask him about his day, and tell him you love him, and protect him from harm, return the notebooks he leaves behind, and do push-ups with him on your back to increase your resistance. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Liu Qingge figured he would be a good boyfriend.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>If Liu Qingge was Shen Yuan’s boyfriend, he would be able to pull him into a kiss when Shen Yuan waited for him after his tournament, staring at him with admiration and awe, bouncing on his feet in excitement. When Shen Yuan pulled him into a hug to congratulate him on winning, he would be able to hold on tighter and swing him around in a circle, before sweeping him into his arms and kissing him (the kissing was very important). </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Instead, all he could do was accept the hug gratefully (awkwardly), patting man he (really really) wanted to kiss on the back in thanks. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That was incredible!” Shen Yuan excitedly recalled when he pulled back from the embrace. “You laid everyone out </span>
  <em>
    <span>flat </span>
  </em>
  <span>so fast!” Shen Yuan slapped Liu Qinnge’s chest, and Liu Qingge was suddenly aware of how sweaty he was. He was sweating even more now, his skin felt like it was on fire where Shen Yuan touched it. “I would ask you to teach me but there’s no fucking way I could even train with you for thirty minutes without needing to be rushed to the hospital.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You can watch me practice.” Liu Qingge said, not eager to let the opportunity to spend more time with Shen Yuan slip through his fingers. “That way you’ll at least know some basics about protecting yourself.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Shen Yuan rubbed his chin. “I might as well. It would be nice to know something for emergencies.” His face suddenly broke out into a smile. “Though I also bet Binghe wouldn’t even let me get into a place where I need to do so.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Great, so now Shen Yuan’s craziness was going to get him killed. “Luo Binghe isn’t here.” Liu Qingge pointed out. He wasn’t here, and he would never be here. “You have to protect yourself.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Shen Yuan crossed his arms. “Yeah, he’s not here </span>
  <em>
    <span>now-”</span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You have to protect yourself.” Liu Qingge reiterated, speaking slower. Shen Yuan glared at him, and Liu Qinnge shuddered. It was kind of hot. That wasn’t important right now. “I can teach you self defense. Just the basics.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Shen Yuan looked thoughtful, pushing his glasses up on his nose. “Well, I guess it couldn’t hurt… Wait. No, it could actually…” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’ll protect you then.” Qingge said, feeling his face heat up. As soon as he realized what he had said, he turned his head to the side, hoping to hide some of his blush. “Just because you can’t do it yourself.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There was no response for a second, before suddenly an (unsubstantial) weight slammed into his body. It caught him completely unprepared, and Liu Qingge let out an undignified yelp as he fell backwards onto the grassy ground outside the dojo. The wind rushed from his lungs, and it took him a moment to come back into his body. There was a weight on his stomach. His vision stopped swimming, and he stared, shocked at Shen Yuan’s smug face. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>… </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Shen Yuan was straddling Liu Qingge’s torso, just above his hips, with his arms crossed and an utterly self-satisfied expression on his face. Liu Qingge dug his fingers into the palms of his hands to stop his body from responding to the </span>
  <em>
    <span>very </span>
  </em>
  <span>potent stimulus it was currently receiving. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Haha, who cant protect themselves now, huh, Liu-</span>
  <em>
    <span>shidi?” </span>
  </em>
  <span>Shen Yuan mocked, his voice faux-hauty, but overhauling amused. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Shidi?!” </span>
  </em>
  <span>Liu Qingge sputtered. What was with that antiquated form of address?! Why did it make even more heat pool in his abdomen? </span>
  <em>
    <span>What is happening?! </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, you couldn’t defend yourself against me, and I’m your senior, so…” Shen Yuan said, shrugging his shoulders. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“That is </span>
  <em>
    <span>so </span>
  </em>
  <span>not how that works.” Liu Qingge pointed out, his pride still bruised. He had just won a goddamn tournament, a sneaky sneak attack while his guard was down did </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>count. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Seems like it from here.” Shen Yuan smiled and poked Liu Qinnge’s face, right where he knew his beauty mark was. The poke turned into a soft pat. “I’m just kidding Qingge. You know that I’d never be able to touch you if you were serious. Let me have you just this once.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>Let me have you just this once. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Okay.” Liu Qingge said without thinking. Shen Yuan laughed, throwing his head back, exposing his throat. Liu Qinnge wanted to taste it, and </span>
  <em>
    <span>holy shit</span>
  </em>
  <span> he needed to calm down. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No need to indulge me, Qingge. I can see how mad you are.” Shen Yuan placed his hands on Liu Qingge’s chest, and Liu Qingge inhaled sharply. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>At that moment, a couple walked out of the dojo. They noticed Liu Qingge and Shen Yuan on the ground, and they gasped. They then sped up theri steps, averting their eyes. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh, haha, I should get up before people get the wrong idea.” Shen Yuan laughed awkwardly. Liu Qingge was confused. Sure, he was pinned, and Shen Yuan was close to him, but was there anything compromising about this position? </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Why would they get the wrong idea?” Liu Qingge asked, bringing his hands to Shen Yuan’s hips. Shen Yuan blushed brighter and waved his hand. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You know-- this position can be kind of-- yeah.” Liu Qingge still didn’t understand. </span>
  <span><br/>
</span>
  <span>“I still don’t get it.” He informed. “What’s wrong with this position?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You don't..?” Shen Yuan trailed off. Liu Qingge waited expectantly. Shen Yuan groaned. “Oh my god we are </span>
  <em>
    <span>so </span>
  </em>
  <span>not having this conversation.” Shen Yuan pushed off of Liu Qingge, standing up and brushing the (non-present) dirt from his clothes. Liu Qingge followed suit. “Binghe would cry tears of blood if he saw that..” Shen Yuan murmured. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No he wouldn’t.” Liu Qingge argued. Fake people can’t cry. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I mean he would be upset and really jealous.” Shen Yuan clarified, pulling his phone from his pocket. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No he wouldn’t.” Liu Qingge said again. Fake people don’t have feelings. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Shen Yuan looked at him like he was crazy, which was ironic. Shen Yuan was the crazy person here. They looked at each other in silence for a few more moments, before there was a distant call. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Cucumber-bro!” Shen Yuan turned around and Liu Qingge looked above his head to see Shen Yuan’s roomate, Shang Qinghua approaching waving his arm. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hey Airplane.” Shen Yuan greeted, giving his friend a ‘secret handshake’ when Shang Qinghua was close enough to do so. “Did your thing end early?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“‘Thing’ he says.” Shang Qinghua sniffed. “It was a </span>
  <em>
    <span>poetry reading </span>
  </em>
  <span>and yes, it did end early.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Who won?” Shen Yuan asked.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Nobody wins a poetry reading, bro.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Shen Yuan pointed to Liu Qingge. “Qingge won.” Liu Qingge puffed up slightly at the acknowledgement. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Ah!” Shang Qinghua flashed a wide grin and a thumbs-up. “Way to go, man!” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Thank you.” Liu Qingge replied. Shang Qinghua wasn’t somebody whose opinion he cared about, and he was here to take Shen Yuan home. Liu Qingge felt like he was allowed to be a little short. It wasn’t out of the ordinary anyway.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Aha, well, Cucumber-bro we should head back. It’s getting dark.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Shen Yuan nodded. “Yeah.” He turned to Liu Qingge, giving him a smile, that in the low light, still managed to stop Liu Qingge’s heart. “Congratulations again, Qingge!” He said with a wave as he walked away. Liu Qingge waved back, before turning on is heel and walking home, determined to do some research to find out why Shen Yuan was so skittish about being seen in that position. Maybe it was because he was crazy.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Liu Qingge figured it out, and no, it wasn’t because he was crazy. He went to sleep that night with a mind full of what he had seen on the internet, and the phantom feeling of Shen Yuan on top of him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He woke up with a sore wrist. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <b>Luo Binghe</b>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Luo Binghe was excited. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Luo Binghe was </span>
  <em>
    <span>so excited. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His spring break had come around, and he had saved up enough money to fly to surprise his boyfriend.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>His amazing, perfect, adorable, radiant, smart, cute, perfect, amazing, </span>
  <em>
    <span>everything </span>
  </em>
  <span>boyfriend, Shen Yuan. Light of his life, his reason for waking up in the morning ang giving every day his all. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Before he had met Shen Yuan, he was driven by spite and a desperate desire to prove himself. He wanted to prove to the world that it was </span>
  <em>
    <span>wrong </span>
  </em>
  <span>to try to destroy Luo Binghe, that he could trample over the worthless people who had pushed him around, belittled and bullied him. He was an infatuated husk of a man. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Then he met Shen Yuan, this sickly little angel who had entered Binghe’s life in a blaze of glory and had burned as brilliantly ever since. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Binghe remembers it like it was yesterday. Two men, Binghe didn’t remember their faces, only that they were older than he was, were attempting to intimidate him, pushing their disgusting selves into his personal space, puffing their chests out like pathetic peacocks. They did the typical asshole-male posturing, ‘You don’t know who you’re messing with,’ ‘You better apologize,’ base nonsense Binghe had heard a million times. He had been fully ready to step in, when a small, smaller than the men and certainly smaller than Binghe, man stepped in between them. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Shen Yuan had yelled at the men, telling them to leave Binghe alone, they didn’t have any right to do this to him, he hadn’t done anything wrong. Shen Yuan said that he had the police ready to call with the push of a button, and if they didn’t step off he would call them, don’t test him. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The men had left. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Shen Yuan had turned around, and Binghe was utterly awed by the man. Small, thin, clearly unhealthy. Eyes that could rival the lushest forest, hair shiny and dark as the finest obsidian, with the face of a fairy, and the courage of a lion. This miraculous creature (so delicate and frail) had put himself in danger, and told the danger to </span>
  <em>
    <span>leave Binghe alone, he didn’t deserve it. </span>
  </em>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was everything he had never heard. It was everything he had ever needed to hear. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Luo Binghe fell in love then and there. That day, his luck seemed to completely reverse, now being shone down on favorably by lady luck. How else would he be fortunate enough for Shen Yuan to return his affections? </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He could hold his love (his savior, his light, his life) in his arms, he could shower him with kisses, he could feed him food that made him giggle in happiness, he could whisper sweet nothings into his ear, he could touch him in ways that would make him </span>
  <em>
    <span>sing. </span>
  </em>
  <span>He could love him, and be loved in return. His A-Yuan was truly the best thing to ever happen to him, and he knows that his darling feels the same way. He told him so! </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>So, suffice to say, Luo Binghe was very excited to see his boyfriend. If he could figure out where he was. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He looked around the unfamiliar campus, scanning the sea of unfamiliar faces, looking for A-Yuan. Maybe he should ask somebody? </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Oh my </span>
  <em>
    <span>fucking god. </span>
  </em>
  <span>There’s no fucking way.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Luo Binghe turned, seeing a man with sharp features and hair pulled into a bun staring disbelievingly at him. Binghe offered a smile out of courtesy, though he couldn’t deny that he was confused by the man’s words. “Can I help you?” He asked, when the man just continued to stare. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I can’t fucking belive this.” The man said, his voice getting more aggravated the more he spoke. Binghe was more concerned now. He wasn’t doing anything wrong, was he? Was this man just… kind of a huge ass? “Come with me.” The man demanded, snapping his fingers. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ah. So the man </span>
  <em>
    <span>was </span>
  </em>
  <span>an asshole. “No, I don’t think I will.” Binghe said, turning away from the unpleasant man. He was scanning the crowd again. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Listen, beast.” The man snapped, and Binghe’s attention whipped back to him. The man had an unpleasant sneer. Binghe wasn’t about to cause problems on A-Yuan’s campus, but this man was </span>
  <em>
    <span>really </span>
  </em>
  <span>testing his patience. “Is your name Luo Binghe?” He asked. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>That was surprising. How did he know who he was? “Yes.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The man rubbed at his temples, muttering curses under his breath. The man took a deep breath. “Are you looking for Shen Yuan?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Binghe perked up, all thoughts of anger flying from his head, replaced by excitement. “You know A-Yuan? A-Yuan talks about me?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“God. Yes, he does. Follow me.” The man snapped his fingers twice, and this time Binghe had no qualms about following him this time, if A-Yuan was where he was headed. They walked, the man still muttering curses and incomprehensible sentences agrilly under his breath as he went. Binghe walked with a spring in his step, and was eventually led to a table that had two unfamiliar men sitting at it. One with short brown hair and glasses, and one with a high black ponytail. More strangers. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Luo. Fucking. Binghe.” His guide introduced, before throwing himself into one of the empty chairs, crossing his arms childishly. The two men started at him, matching expressions of shock on their faces. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <em>
    <span>“What.” </span>
  </em>
  <span>Ponytail said, his voice sharp. The other didn’t say anything, just looked. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Binghe was uncomfortable. He cleared his throat. “Pleased to meet you.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Nobody responded. This was unpleasant. Where was A-Yuan? He was about to open his mouth and ask, when his favorite sound cut through the ambient noise of the crowd. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Binghe?!” Luo Binghe quickly turned toward the voice, his </span>
  <em>
    <span>A-Yuan’s voice, </span>
  </em>
  <span>and felt a massive beaming grin split his face when he saw him. He was dressed plainly, light jeans and green sneakers, and wrapped up in Binghe’s own sweater. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“A-Yuan!” He yelled, uncaring of the attention it got from strangers. Binghe ran forward, delighted to see that Shen Yuan had started to do the same. Binghe was faster, and as soon as he could, he swept his love up into his arms, rejoicing in the feeling of having him where he </span>
  <em>
    <span>belonged </span>
  </em>
  <span>again</span>
  <em>
    <span>. </span>
  </em>
  <span>He laughed, overcome with joy as he lifted A-Yuan off of his feet, spinning him in a circle. “A-Yuan, A-Yuan!” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Binghe-!! You-!!” Binghe stopped spinning, and set Shen Yuan down, still keeping his arms tight around his waist. Shen Yuan’s smile was radiant as he looked up at Binghe, his eyes bright with happiness and surprise. Binghe didn’t hold back anymore, and brought his hands up to A-Yuan’s face, before pulling him into a long-awaited kiss. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Shen Yuan made a sound of surprise, one that Binghe swallowed eagerly as he deepened the kiss, rejoicing as Shen Yuan responded enthusiastically, his hands clutching onto Binghe’s shirt. They kissed for a while longer, Binghe playfully nipping at Shen Yuan’s lips, licking into his mouth, before they both pulled away. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Shen Yuan’s face, flushed, eyes blown wide, panting breaths leaving his kissed-red lips, was a sight beyond words. Binghe brought his hands up to his cheeks. “Surprise.” He said, smile coloring his breathless voice. “Is A-Yuan happy to see me?” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Shen Yuan buried his face into Binghe’s chest, wrapping his arms tightly around him. Binghe’s heart was </span>
  <em>
    <span>so </span>
  </em>
  <span>full.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Of course I did…” Shen Yuan admitted, his voice muffled. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Surely, nobody could blame Binghe for kissing his boyfriend again after that. </span>
</p>
<p><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m going to fucking kill him.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Do </span>
  <em>
    <span>not </span>
  </em>
  <span>joke about that.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No, he’s right for once.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“He is </span>
  <em>
    <span>not.</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p>
