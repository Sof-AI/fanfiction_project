    <p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Five months after Cang Qiong Mountain Sect appointed its new generation of peak lords, Sect Leader Yue Qingyuan appointed his former Shijie - a disciple who had once also been in the running for his title - as acting head of the sect, and disappeared.</p><p> </p><p>A year after that disappearance, Peak Lord Shen Qingqiu, master of Qing Jing Peak, did almost precisely the same thing.</p><p> </p><p>In the cultivation world it was not uncommon for esteemed and powerful cultivators to withdraw into seclusion or disappear onto quests for years - even decades - at a time. But it was nearly unheard of for lords so newly appointed to their status to do such things. By tradition, Cang Qiong Sect’s leaders ruled together as a generation - they ascended as a generation, appointed successors at the same time, and were notoriously loyal. This system was intended to prevent schisms between the peaks. Fighting within the sect would have surely weakened its standing and risked spreading war throughout the cultivation world. Ordinarily if several peak lords fell to death or calamity or became withdrawn from the conventional matters of running their peaks, then it would be a sure sign of the old leadership standing down soon and another generation being chosen to take over.</p><p> </p><p>But how could such a thing happen only a handful of years after new lords had ascended to begin with?</p><p> </p><p>The other peak lords swiftly established that while the two most highly ranked leaders within the sect were <em>away,</em> they were certainly not <em>missing</em> and most assuredly not dead. They were simply handling many many matters and had appointed trusted persons to act as go-betweens. Outside of Cang Qiong, such explanations were easy to accept - and even made some of the other cultivation sects wary, for who knew what machinations had taken hold of these fresh and largely unknown talents?</p><p> </p><p>Within the sect, there was more awareness of the reality that two of the twelve great peak lords were simply… gone. Without a word.</p><p> </p><p>Speculations on why ran rampant.</p><p> </p><p>Even so life in the cultivation world carried on as well and monumental events did not pause or hold themselves back for a lack of key players. The Heavenly Demon Tianlang-Jun waged a devastating war that saw the decimation of Huan Hua Palace and nearly ended many other sects besides, before Bai Zhan Peak’s Liu Qingge and An Ding Peak’s Shang Qinghua were able to combine efforts and subdue him. More than a decade later and unbeknownst to the sect or even the boy himself, Tianlang-Jun’s half-demon bastard became a disciple of Qian Cao’s Mu Qingfang. During the Immortal Alliance Conference in his teen years, said bastard half-demon unlocked his demonic blood and inadvertently created a rift between the lords of Cang Qiong - with half the sect choosing to consort with demons while the other half condemned them for it. Lacking strong leadership of any kind, the schism resulted in a dreaded civil war that dragged the rest of the cultivation world into its wake, and ultimately ended with half of the twelve peaks being swallowed up into the demonic realms - the world’s once-greatest sect was irrevocably weakened and shattered.</p><p> </p><p>But none of that really mattered to two men who had absconded to a farm in the middle of fucking nowhere.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>~</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The farmhouse was old and rundown, but it was clear that someone had started to recently try and fix it up again.</p><p> </p><p>New fencing had been inserted starkly against the contrast of older materials, mostly to partition a vegetable garden off from a recently-built chicken coop. A few fat hens pecked around in the dirt. Not quite enough to justify a coop that was nearly the size of a barn, but one might assume that the owner had plans to add to their flock. The vegetable garden was still growing in, but a glance further towards the back of the house revealed an older one that had probably been there once - there were plants obviously in the midst of being moved, and signs of the past garden having been set upon by pests. The owner had clearly started to move things towards a workers’ house on the property for convenience. The main house, while much larger, showed no signs of having been fixed up and was in heavy disrepair. One might easily have guessed that whoever was fixing up this property did not have much help or need for extra rooms and had deemed the smaller house enough. No plans for family just yet. Probably someone very young or very solitary in nature.</p><p> </p><p>Shen Qingqiu felt certain that the rumours he’d followed were inaccurate, and was on the verge of turning and leaving as a matter of course until the door to the small house opened and out walked Yue Qingyuan.</p><p> </p><p>Cang Qiong’s Sect Leader was dressed like a farmer, although he had not put on his hat yet. The day was overcast but warm. His collar was loose. A simple leather thong kept his hair back from his face - which made the features of that face unmistakable. There was a patch over one knee of his pants and a smudge of soil on his left cheek. Without knowing his background a stranger would have probably looked at this person and decided he had a hardworking countenance. He seemed handsome and honest and simple. A very compelling sort of person with good posture and some education perhaps, but not someone entirely out of place on a humble little farm.</p><p> </p><p>Shen Qingqiu stared.</p><p> </p><p>He was having feelings about this.</p><p> </p><p>He wasn’t sure what to make of them all, which ultimately made them all unwelcome. The last time he had found this person again he had been faced with the glamorous head disciple of a mighty cultivation sect. When Yue Qingyuan had suddenly left after achieving what was quite probably the highest possible glory in the cultivation world, Shen Qingqiu had wondered what further greatness that person thought he could achieve elsewhere. More riches? More respect? More glory? What ambition was he chasing that even leading the greatest cultivation sect in the world was something he looked down upon with dissatisfaction?</p><p> </p><p>Now Shen Qingqiu was looking at a farmer. He was looking at someone who did not seem lofty or unattainable in the least, and he had no idea <em>why.</em></p><p> </p><p>For a long minute he simply stood on the road near to the farmhouse and stared. Yue Qingyuan stretched his arms and yawned. He took out and redid the tie for his hair and reached for the handle of a tool that he’d set down near to his door.</p><p> </p><p>His gaze finally swept over towards the road.</p><p> </p><p>He froze in place.</p><p> </p><p>Shen Qingqiu did not have to wonder how out-of-place <em>he</em> looked. His image was meticulously crafted and maintained, and even after flying on Xiu Ya for several hours there was scarcely a hair of his that was out of place. His robes were pristine. He was every inch an immortal master in appearance and that was what he was, what he had fought tooth and nail to become, clawing through Qing Jing’s two-faced politics and inserting himself at the side of his ever-critical and sneering shizun until there was no one else left who might take the post next to the future sect leader. He had worked for years to build this facade that would let him - that would grant him power and authority that even Yue Qingyuan would have to respect. A position so far from where they’d started that surely no one would associate it with a worthless slave boy.</p><p> </p><p>It painted a picture wholly unsuited to this rural, overgrown road and dilapidated farm and handsome young peasant.</p><p> </p><p>The sound of Shen Qingqiu’s fan opening seemed inexplicably loud as it snapped through the air.</p><p> </p><p>“Sect Leader,” he said. The title dripped with accusation.</p><p> </p><p>Just outside the coop, one of the chickens swooped down onto an unlucky field mouse and stripped it to the bone.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>~</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The farm was remote, but there was a village within traveling distance. It was two hours to get there by ox cart. Yue Qi did not own an ox cart. He had taken relatively little with him when he left Cang Qiong. It hadn’t seemed right to fill his pockets with sect funds when this choice was of no benefit to the sect - when he had no intention of going back or ever involving himself with that world again. He had taken much of his clothing, because that was his at least, and he had wrapped Xuan Su and strapped it to his back. Then he had packed up some food, but it wasn’t as if he needed much - just enough to keep the travels from becoming too unpleasant without it. He had sold or traded most of his clothing quite swiftly. The deep black fabrics and intricate patterns were too eye-catching for discretion. And some of the pieces were very valuable - selling them to wealthier merchants netted him enough coin that when his travels finally brought him to this outlying region, the village head was more than happy to hand over the deed for an overrun farm. A place that otherwise wasn’t benefiting anyone. Villagers had been excited enough at the new neighbour to show up with some gifts of food and spare tools and offers to sell or give treated wood for fencing and furniture. Yue Qi had bought his chickens and his seeds from his neighbours. He had listened attentively to every elder who offered him advice, since he knew next to nothing at all about farming and needed the guidance quite a bit.</p><p> </p><p>The first month had been a disaster. It was lucky he could actually survive without food or clean water, or he probably would have been reduced to begging.</p><p> </p><p>The second month he did better. And then better and better from there. But feeding big livestock still seemed like a challenge he was not yet up to. Walking wasn't too much of a trial and time was not so precious to someone who had transcended many of the normal restrictions of mortality.</p><p> </p><p>The nearby village was small. There were more farms on the south side of it but there were very few shops or merchants. Mainly just a trading post and houses. Most of the residents were older, as many of the younger people left to go earn money in the nearest city and send that home to parents and grandparents instead. Usually such travelers came back home after their fortunes failed to propel them any further; some stayed to help labour on the farms, too, but Yue Qi didn’t go out of his way to socialize more than he needed to in order to avoid being seen as <em>un</em>sociable. Even the nearest city in the region was not a large one, and it was more than two days worth of travel to reach it. There were no nearby cultivation sects, and not much oversight from any ruler. The village was tiny enough to lack any kind of inn, but someone flying by sword could have probably reached the city and its establishments before nightfall.</p><p> </p><p>Yue Qi did not mention that last point to Shen Qingqiu. Instead he only mentioned the lack of inn at the village. Some part of him was still expecting his shidi to simply stalk off - he wasn’t sure how this person had found him, or why; if he had been sent by the sect or… but, he had probably come on behalf of the sect. An investigation was likely mounted after he didn't return for such a long time.</p><p> </p><p>His heart still skittered erratically in his chest when Shen Qingqiu accepted his offer of lodging and sat at his meager little table to eat with him.</p><p> </p><p>Up until this point Yue Qi had not felt at all self-conscious over the state of his new life. He hadn’t thought of things in a manner relative to success or social ranking. Cang Qiong was beautiful and peaceful and there was much to be said for the atmosphere of Qiong Ding Peak. There, he was Sect Leader Yue. He had authority and respect and was deferred to and looked up to. Even though he was still relatively young, it didn’t matter. His title and his strength made him the peerless person whom everyone else was obliged to turn to. He had the finest things, antiques and cultivation tools and books and treasures aplenty. He had not hated that.</p><p> </p><p>But in the end it wasn’t what he’d wanted either.</p><p> </p><p>What he’d wanted… what he’d wanted a dream he had been forced to give up hope on. The person who wanted to be the most lofty and the person who deserved it was the person currently sitting across from him in his rundown farmhouse. The person whom Yue Qi had failed and failed again, until his presence had only become a burden. One morning he had woken up and realized that he could not carry on like this. Every time he spoke to Shen Qingqiu, the man made it clear that his presence was unwanted. And why wouldn’t it be? Even if he devoted all of his energies as Sect Leader to elevating Shen Qingqiu, it wouldn’t be enough to erase his past failings. It also wouldn’t be fair to the rest of the sect. Ultimately Yue Qingyuan had no idea why his shizun had named him her successor. If she thought he was the sort of person who would universally look after everyone’s best interests then she had been mistaken. Maybe on another morning this revelation would not have come to him, or maybe he would not have acted on it even if he had. But that day he realized that staying where he was would do no one any favours. Shen Jiu was grown and had forged a life for himself. Cang Qiong Sect was Cang Qiong Sect. Any of Yue Qingyuan’s martial siblings could have taken his job and likely upheld his duties well enough, and <em>without</em> the staggering weakness of a cultivation flaw that would kill them for wielding their own swords. The entire reason why Yue Qi had joined the sect was because he needed a place to bring Shen Jiu, and because he needed the strength to get him there.</p><p> </p><p>Without such motive… with his presence only a burden to the person he expressly wished to help… there was no good reason for him to stay.</p><p> </p><p>Leaving had only seemed more correct to him after he had done so. There was a satisfaction in figuring out how to live on his own that he had never appreciated before. Having no master to serve and no disciples to guide, no one to depend on and no depending on him in turn, was… not perfect, he could admit. There was a loneliness to it that unsettled him, and a lack of purpose that sometimes left him floundering, losing track of time and the motive to get up some mornings. But there was also a novelty to it that had sustained him well enough. He had never before had the chance to figure out who he was when he was beholden to no one else.</p><p> </p><p>As it turned out, he seemed to be a man who liked simple things. He liked chickens. They were sharper and more vicious than their reputation had led him to believe, but he didn’t mind that. He liked building things, and figuring out how to build things. He liked quiet moments of solitude in the evening, when the sun was setting and there was nothing around him except the wind. He liked slipping backwards into dreams and memories and having no one come to jolt him away from them, nothing to encourage him to put aside his attachments or overcome his flaws. He liked to <em>wallow</em> a little while he prodded his own heartache like a sore tooth.</p><p> </p><p>Being a humble and even pathetic man was not as bad as it seemed.</p><p> </p><p>But with Shen Qingqiu sitting in the small farmhouse, he suddenly felt self-consciousness again. Being pathetic alone was not quite the same as being pathetic with witnesses. It was lucky he had two bowls to serve with, though one was chipped. Yue Qi gave the good bowl to his guest of course and served him carefully from his cooking pot, splitting one serving of food into two and wishing he still had some fruit preserves from his neighbours. Or at least some rice, and not just the same grains he fed his chickens, clumsily boiled beyond recognition. The lone spoon was also given to Shen Qingqiu while Yue Qi sipped from his bowl and felt every ragged thread of his clothing, every soil-stained handprint he’d left on the door, every tool he’d set out and forgotten to put back in its right place.</p><p> </p><p>Shen Qingqiu’s robes looked so pale and clean he was practically <em>glowing.</em></p><p> </p><p>He ate Yue Qi’s food. He looked around his house. He stared balefully at a hen that had made her way onto his windowsill.</p><p> </p><p>He did not speak.</p><p> </p><p>Eventually it was Yue Qi who broke the silence.</p><p> </p><p>“Did Shidi come here looking for me?” he asked.</p><p> </p><p>Shen Qingqiu’s eyes narrowed.</p><p> </p><p>“Why else should I come to such a place?” he replied with a sneer.</p><p> </p><p>Yue Qi probably should not have felt warmed by such a coldly delivered sentiment. But he was a starved man in some respects, and long accustomed to appreciating whatever scraps he could get - and in implication, this scrap was possibly not even a 'scrap' at all.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>~</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Shen Qingqiu did not leave.</p><p> </p><p>It seemed as if he was trying to figure something out.</p><p> </p><p>Yue Qi probably should have sent him away. Back to Cang Qiong and his peak and his disciples and the success he had so rightly earned. But Shen Qingqiu was his own man and made his own choices, so maybe he could be forgiven for not even broaching the topic at all. Instead he gave Shen Qingqiu his bed, and then he set about exceptional efforts to clean up the little farmhouse. He scrubbed the soil stains off of the door and finished the new fencing, fixed the cracked window covers and wobbly section of floorboards and broken back door. He went into the village and stopped at the trading post to barter (some of his eggs and the last of his sect coins) for a decent tea set and wooden utensils, and wheat noodles and a fresh mattress. Some of the old aunties saw him and asked knowingly if he’d found a girl. Yue Qi only laughed and shook his head and admitted an old friend was visiting.</p><p> </p><p>A few knowing looks remained.</p><p> </p><p>One day bled into the next and then the next. Shen Qingqiu drifted around Yue Qi’s farm in full incongruity, gleaming and untouchable and sharp as knives. It made Yue Qi think of one of the village legends about a farmer who had found a celestial maiden in his field, and tricked her into becoming his wife. As soon as his mind made the comparison it shied away again. Yue Qi was trapping no one, and Shen Qingqiu was very far from maidenly. But he did not deserve to sleep on uncomfortable floors or persist in any sort of squalor. The little farm house had only one room. It always smelled like whatever was in the cooking pot and at night it was impossible for him not to see Shen Qingqiu’s back. He lay awake staring at the distance between them more times than he could count, silently reciting the verses his shizun used to make him repeat when she realigned his veins in order to ensure he had not fallen unconscious.</p><p> </p><p>Xuan Su was tied up in the rafters.</p><p> </p><p>Yue Qi wished he could leave it there and never look at it again.</p><p> </p><p>He turned his eyes towards the big farmhouse. Shen Qingqiu could leave at any time. But when more than a week had passed by and he hadn’t, Yue Qi rolled up his sleeves and permitted himself enough delusion to begin making extensive repairs.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>~</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>“What are you doing?” Shen Qingqiu asked.</p><p> </p><p>It was night. It was dark, and it was quiet. The warmth from the little farmhouse’s hearth was fading and the air was unseasonably cold. Not that cold bothered either them. Neither cold nor hunger could touch them anymore, but they were still human and even when that was true, part of them still remembered, and part of them would always dislike the cold and hunger anyway. That was undoubtedly why Shen Qingqiu had moved until he was a scant handspan away from where that Yue Qingyuan was lying.</p><p> </p><p>The other man was quiet for a while, but he wasn’t asleep. He had worked from dawn until dusk on the roof of the big house, pausing only to attend to other chores that needed to be done. Shen Qingqiu had not lifted a finger even once since he arrived. When inaction bothered him, he flew off on Xiu Ya and went to see what kind of wild monsters he could find in the region.</p><p> </p><p>There weren’t many.</p><p> </p><p>Yue Qingyuan rolled to his side and faced him.</p><p> </p><p>“Why did you come after me?” he asked instead.</p><p> </p><p>Shen Qingqiu’s teeth clenched in frustration. Of course this man would not answer his question. When had he ever deigned to explain himself to people beneath him?</p><p> </p><p>In the dark he could barely see Yue Qingyuan’s eyes. He didn’t want it to, but it reminded him of when they were much younger. When they used to sleep in that wretched house with a dozen other children, crowded in on one another for warmth and to avoid the places where the roof leaked. The children who had curled together back then had needed each other. In the way of children and fools, they had convinced themselves that need was also want. That proximity was affection and a lack of options was the same as choosing to be together. In time they learned better. One boy learned that given the choice, there was much better company to be found - that his companion of circumstance was not worth his time or attention and that life was better without the burden of him. And the other boy had learned that he was scum, real and true, and the only things that welcomed his presence were monsters that smelled their likeness on him.</p><p> </p><p>The silence of unanswered questions stretched on.</p><p> </p><p>Shen Qingqiu was struck by the idea that if he left now, tonight, then he would never see this person again. If he went back to Qing Jing Peak then even if he someday returned to this farmhouse, it would be empty. It would be empty and it would be silent because Yue Qi would rather flee to the edges of the earth and hide in the darkest corners there than endure being sought out by the parasite that had latched onto him in childhood.</p><p> </p><p>“It’s funny, isn’t it?” he said quietly. Resignation weighted his tone. “The one who wanted to have someone come for him waited in vain. The one who wished to escape was found twice over.”</p><p> </p><p>Yue Qingyuan didn’t reply.</p><p> </p><p>Shen Qingqiu turned away from him.</p><p> </p><p>It was on the tip of his tongue to promise to leave and never darken the other man’s doorstep again. The words, vicious and fully-formed, wanted to claw their way from his throat to defend the part of him that was peeled raw and dangerously open. But he couldn’t do it. He could have snapped and snarled any number of things, could have coldly jammed some knife or other deeper into the yawning chasm between them, but he couldn’t say that he would never try and seek out this person again.</p><p> </p><p>That was too bold of a lie, even for someone like him.</p><p> </p><p>“You think… I wish to escape you?” Yue Qingyuan asked quietly.</p><p> </p><p>Shen Qingqiu stilled.</p><p> </p><p>“Don’t insult me by claiming otherwise,” he whispered.</p><p> </p><p>He wasn’t expecting the hand that reached for him then. Maybe it <em>was</em> too much like when they were children. Maybe that made it seem somehow appropriate for such a gesture to happen. For a warm palm to close over his arm and tug him just slightly backwards, as if one slightly bigger boy was sheltering another from the spiteful world.</p><p> </p><p>“Xiao Jiu,” Yue Qi whispered in the same low and secretive tone. “It’s Xiao Jiu who should have wished to be rid of <em>me.</em> The longer he stays here, the more reluctant I am to see him leave.”</p><p> </p><p>“Liar,” Shen Jiu accused, traveling back through time despite himself. “What if I stay here forever? On what morning will I wake up to find that Qi-ge has abandoned me again?”</p><p> </p><p>Yue Qi’s breath hitched. The grip on him tightened.</p><p> </p><p>“Xiao…” the other man started. But he choked on the rest. Shen Jiu’s eyes widened as the hold on him transitioned to a full embrace, and he found he was being clutched - was being wept on. With disbelieving fingers he reached behind himself until he felt Yue Qi’s cheeks. It was difficult, because the face he was angling towards was hidden in his hair. Yue Qi did not cry loudly and if they had not been so physically close then it might not have been obvious. But his body trembled and the hitch of his breaths was telling. A brush of Shen Jiu’s index finger against a single cheek finally came back wet.</p><p> </p><p>Yue Qi was not a person who cried.</p><p> </p><p>“Qi-ge won’t leave anymore,” Yue Qi swore.</p><p> </p><p>Between the two of them, something long frozen over and twisted in darkness saw its first fragile crack of daylight.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>~</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Shen Jiu did not sell his clothes.</p><p> </p><p>He folded them up and put them in the Good Chest, which was one of the few usable pieces of furniture left behind in the main farmhouse. Most likely because whoever build it had clearly done so within the room that housed it, and made it too heavy for most persons to carry even four at a time. Shen Jiu lifted it by himself with only some difficulty for its unwieldiness, and moved it to the small farmhouse. Unlike Yue Qi, he had not hesitated to bring a large sum of coin with him when he left. For one thing his mission had been to find the Sect Leader, which seemed inarguably like ‘sect business’. For another, he was not the sort of person who would have cared either way and, not knowing where his search would take him or how long it would keep him occupied for, he had filled his pockets with enough money to travel in the style to which he had deliberately become accustomed.</p><p> </p><p>Several weeks into his arrival, Shen Jiu took his money and flew to the nearest city. In its way being over-dressed could be as undignified as being under-dressed. Shen Jiu did not spend a lot of time reasoning on it - he simply bartered for the materials to make several outfits in cuts and styles that still suited him, but were less ostentatious. Then he found a good tailor to make them to his exacting specifications. Clothes were not made overnight of course, so he spent some time in the city and acquired a few other things. Books, for one. Tools for another. Shen Jiu had never lived any sort of farm life but he had lived on the road and in the company of a renowned cheat, and some things were universally useful. Among his most expensive purchases were the materials required to make several talismans - particularly sturdy ones for heating and cooling water, protecting locations from demonic energy, repelling small monsters, and the like. He also bought a lot of quality writing paper and ink and a decent calligraphy set.</p><p> </p><p>At a market stall he found an embroidered perfume sachet. Blue and gold. The scent was earthy but pleasant, white musk and cedar.</p><p> </p><p>When he returned he found Yue Qi outside. The man was building a writing desk. There was a stack of hardwood in one of the cleared rooms of the main house, where the weather wouldn’t touch it.</p><p> </p><p>Yue Qi nearly hammered his thumb when Shen Jiu alighted off of Xiu Ya.</p><p> </p><p>Shen Qingqiu tutted.</p><p> </p><p>“Since when are you clumsy?”</p><p> </p><p>Yue Qi’s expression was hard to look at.</p><p> </p><p>“Xiao Jiu came back,” he said, not acknowledging the jab at all. Shen Jiu turned his head aside. He didn’t care to contemplate the implication that he might not have. If he was asked why, he wouldn’t have a good answer for it and he wasn’t prepared to say such things out loud. Particularly not in the broad light of day. After all, from a certain perspective there was no reason he shouldn’t have gone back to his peak by now.</p><p> </p><p>Instead he tossed the perfume sachet on top of the half-made desk.</p><p> </p><p>“Use this. You smell like sweat,” he declared.</p><p> </p><p>He turned before he could see the way Yue Qi’s expression warmed, or watch his lips curl upwards, or see him tuck the gift into his inner shirt pocket.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>~</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>One of Yue Qi’s nearest neighbours - who was still not very nearby at all - fermented their own alcohol. They claimed it had remarkable medicinal properties and was especially helpful in regulating spiritual energy.</p><p> </p><p>Yue Qi traded for jars but mostly to use it as a cleaning agent.</p><p> </p><p>He watched Shen Jiu’s pale throat move as he downed an entire bowl of terrible yam wine. The irregularity in his cultivation had not gone unnoticed by Yue Qi, but neither of them had spoken out loud about it yet anyway. In the time since Shen Jiu had become a disciple of Qing Jing, such things had long established themselves as commonplace for him anyway. He was the only peak lord successor to have been appointed without a golden core fully formed, and was the only one to routinely suffer setbacks. In the past whenever Yue Qi brought attention to it, it had not gone over well. He had learned to be more silently helpful. While alcohol was often over-reputed as an aid for spiritual problems, he didn’t own anything else with medicinal herbs of any sort in it.</p><p> </p><p>Shen Jiu had been open to the suggestion of drinking.</p><p> </p><p>It could get somewhat boring in this place, and the other man had run short of his supply of paper days ago, and had finally and read all of his books.</p><p> </p><p>When the bowl was empty he motioned with it. Yue Qi refilled it for him, then took a largely performative sip from his own.</p><p> </p><p>It still tasted extremely potent and too bitter for words.</p><p> </p><p>“How is it?” he nevertheless dared to ask.</p><p> </p><p>Shen Jiu gave him a <em>look </em>for the sheer audacity of the question, but drained another bowl. That it was probably helping somewhat went unspoken. Yue Qi watched for signs of improvement - which he noted at first - but soon enough the only outwardly detectable signs were of drunkenness instead. Colour gradually overtook Shen Jiu’s cheeks. His posture remained good but he began to list ever-so-slightly as the bottle was emptied. He listed in the direction of Yue Qi. A certain brightness came into his eyes. The mouth, which was often so prone to neutral displeasure or open sneers, softened into something that Yue Qi would never ever describe as a ‘pout’ to the other man’s face.</p><p> </p><p>He was free to describe it as such in his own thoughts though.</p><p> </p><p>“Why did Qi-ge want to live in a dump?” Shen Jiu groused out of the blue, after almost half an hour of silent drinking and glaring.</p><p> </p><p>His petulant tone surprised a chuckle out of Yue Qi.</p><p> </p><p>“Is this a dump?” he asked. It was taking a while to get the main house in order, but he’d fixed the roof and the floors and cleaned up enough of the rooms that Shen Jiu had his own now, bigger than the small farmhouse in its entirety. The main house was not overly large - the original farm family had more concerns when it came to heating space than a pair of cultivators with the skill for simple talismans did - but it could have easily housed a decent-sized family. With Yue Qi’s gradual improvements, it looked better than most of the houses in the village and several of those in the outlying farms. There was a study with a hardwood desk. Yue Qi had a hitherto undiscovered love and talent for carpentry, and he had begun growing marigolds in the vegetable garden to help attract bees and deter beetles. The window of Shen Jiu’s room overlooked some of the bright blooms and the distant woodland. The window in the study, which was even larger, was perfectly positioned to let in the most light and had an even better view of the woodland.</p><p> </p><p>The farmhouse was not Qing Jing Peak, but it had beauty. Yue Qi wasn’t so insecure in it all to deny that. He had lived in worse places - and so had Xiao Jiu.</p><p> </p><p>After a moment Shen Jiu scoffed and slumped onto the table in front of him.</p><p> </p><p>“Maybe it’s not <em>that</em> bad,” he conceded, with an even more exaggerated pout. “It would be less of a dump if Qi-ge finished the big bed soon.”</p><p> </p><p>Yue Qi fought to disguise his shock and delight. In truth he had never once seen Shen Jiu drunk before. When they were children they had once stolen some mouthfuls of terrible wine, but at that age it only tasted bad and made Xiao Jiu retch. Once they were at Cang Qiong he never saw Shen Jiu drink enough to get more than a slight dusting of pink on his cheeks, not even when Zui Xian Peak’s disciples had their twice-yearly tasting festivals, and did their level best to test what everyone’s threshold was. This sulky and spoiled behaviour reminded him so much of the little boy he’d known that he was immediately enchanted.</p><p> </p><p>“Xiao Jiu,” he couldn’t help cooing. “Qi-ge will finish your bed as soon as he can! He just wants it to be perfect.”</p><p> </p><p>This seemed to mollify Shen Jiu.</p><p> </p><p>“Qi-ge’s side will face the window so the light doesn’t shine in Xiao Jiu’s face in the morning,” he declared.</p><p> </p><p>Yue Qi’s heart skipped a beat.</p><p> </p><p>Qi-ge’s… side…?</p><p> </p><p>Of the big bed?</p><p> </p><p>The bed he was building for Shen Jiu…?</p><p> </p><p>Suddenly, Shen Jiu wasn’t the only one with flushed cheeks.</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, that…” he coughed self-consciously. “Doesn’t Xiao Jiu want the bed all to himself…?”</p><p> </p><p>This suggestion earned him a petulant glare.</p><p> </p><p>“No!” Shen Jiu snapped. “Why should I? Qi-ge exiled poor Xiao Jiu to sleep alone on a cold mattress in a desolate room for so long already. Even with a big fancy bed he won’t sleep with Xiao Jiu? He doesn’t want to?”</p><p> </p><p>“No, no, that’s not it!” Yue Qi hastened to assure him. His heart was hammering so fast he wasn’t able to even tell which emotions he was feeling yet - but there were a lot of them. “Qi-ge would be honoured to warm Xiao Jiu’s bed.”</p><p> </p><p>“<em>Our</em> bed!” Shen Jiu insisted, still sulking. “Qi-ge has to move into the main house too and not leave Xiao Jiu all alone here anymore, or else Xiao Jiu will bully him! Xiao Jiu will be mean to him and - and mean to the chickens, too!”</p><p> </p><p>Yue Qi’s internal flailing reached such a point that it could only be expressed. It came out in an incredulous laugh. Even if Shen Jiu and he now technically lived in separate houses, it was hardly as if they spent much time apart!</p><p> </p><p>“Ah, Xiao Jiu,” he said, moving closer to this irresistible development. To think that this person could still act like a spoiled child! Not that he’d ever been truly spoiled in his life, but that made such a display all the more precious. It meant Yue Qi still had a chance to indulge him in some things. “Don’t be mean to your Qi-ge or his birds! All Xiao Jiu has to do is ask for something and Qi-ge will give it to him, doesn’t he know this by now?”</p><p> </p><p>Shen Jiu sniffed.</p><p> </p><p>Then he slumped sideways. With the decreased distance between them this moved him right into Yue Qi’s personal space. Yue Qi's already-erratic heart nearly died on the spot as Shen Jiu wrapped his arms around his waist, and settled his head against his chest. It was the perfect angle for his chin to dig in there, but Yue Qi could not have minded the jab of it even if he endured it for a thousand years. Shen Jiu’s mouth was still twisted in a pout. His cheeks were flushed. He blinked up at him from underneath his long lashes, loose hair framing his face, collar slanting distinctly towards one shoulder. His hands clutched Yue Qi’s clothes.</p><p> </p><p>“Then Qi-ge must take Xiao Jiu to bed,” he insisted.</p><p> </p><p>Yue Qi’s pants immediately became tighter in a particular region. The part of his mind that had been dancing obliviously around fond childhood memories promptly flew away as he became aware of just what the other emotions he’d been feeling were.</p><p> </p><p>…Ah.</p><p> </p><p>This… was… well.</p><p> </p><p>“Bed,” Shen Jiu insisted.</p><p> </p><p>Yue Qi made an emergency decision. Reaching down he swept Shen Jiu up into his arms, and lifted him into a bridal carry that was <em>well</em> <em>clear</em> of any suspiciously bulging segments of his lower body, which put him unusually high up. In his current state Shen Jiu’s reaction to this move was to let out a surprised sound, then almost immediately sink his fingers into Yue Qi’s hair. Somehow Yue Qi managed to get them to the bedroom despite the fingertips pressing along his scalp, and the way that was not in the least helping with… other situations. He settled Shen Jiu onto his mattress and eased the pillow beneath his head. But Shen Jiu, though drunk, wasn’t actually sleepy and so all of his attempts to escape and promises that they would sleep together once the big bed was ready were thwarted by a pair of very strong (and not at all scrawny or street-brat-like) arms, which proceeded to capture Yue Qi by the waist and refuse to let go.</p><p> </p><p>He could only just roll over to put his back to Shen Jiu, before Shen Jiu thoroughly trapped him. A silent breath of relief escaped him.</p><p> </p><p>“Won’t let Qi-ge escape,” the other man murmured against his spine. “No no no, if Qi-ge is giving Xiao Jiu what he asks for then he can't ever leave again! He's my prisoner!"</p><p> </p><p>Yue Qi’s cock jumped in his pants. He shivered.</p><p> </p><p>“Xiao Jiu…” he protested.</p><p> </p><p>Shen Jiu’s nails dug into his stomach. Warning. Like a cat’s claws.</p><p> </p><p>He crossed his legs and focused on his breathing. Maybe a meditation technique would help with this…?</p><p> </p><p>From his vantage point, of course, he completely missed the drunk but satisfied smirk which Shen Jiu hid against his back.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>~</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>The next morning Shen Jiu was all snarls and hung-over, but he let Yue Qi check his meridians without much asking or commentary from either of them - and when the big bed was built he wordlessly placed Yue Qi's pillow on the window-facing side.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>~</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Yue Qi’s population of chickens grew.</p><p> </p><p>The need for eggs had doubled, after all, and he had the space. He considered getting a rooster but felt hesitant about it. There was more complexity in handling a group with mixed genders and he'd had some rough introductions with it as it was. Some of the new hens he brought in got into conflicts with his existing birds. One of his hens in particular - a small girl he felt sure would be overrun and bullied by the others - had become something of a coop tyrant instead, and routinely bullied newcomers and made sure the hens she liked got the best treats while the others were left with scraps. She kicked and bit remorselessly and didn't even lay all that often.</p><p> </p><p>She was Yue Qi’s favourite bird. He was somewhat afraid that if he brought in a rooster she would murder it. Or - even worse - die trying.</p><p> </p><p>A rooster wasn’t really needed anyway, despite the bumps in the road Yue Qi’s flock grew as his ability to feed it also grew. The birds were healthy and laid often, and all of them were more or less willing to let him handle them once he figured out the right amount of spiritual energy to transfer to make the handling pleasant. It helped with their health as well; his chickens were very plump and sported glossy plumage, and were always full of energy. Even his favourite small hen was a quick-moving terror of impeccable health and swift-healing injuries.</p><p> </p><p>“A-Qiu,” he said as he fed her some of her favourite seeds. “I will share a secret.”</p><p> </p><p>The chicken did not look up from the seeds, but she also let him pat her softly on the back.</p><p> </p><p>“I think I am in love with Xiao Jiu.”</p><p> </p><p>Chicken A-Qiu made a soft buck-buck noise.</p><p> </p><p>“No, no, of course I have always cared about him. I mean in a different way,” he explained. “Perhaps that’s why I didn’t realize it at first…”</p><p> </p><p>His favourite chicken have him a thoroughly unimpressed look, shook out her feathers, and wandered off.</p><p> </p><p>Yue Qi sighed.</p><p> </p><p>Perhaps one of the other chickens would be more amenable to listening to his woes. Options for conversation were somewhat limited on the farm…</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>~</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>During one of his trips into the village to trade for some things, a neighbour told Yue Qi about a bookseller who was passing along one of the trade routes that just barely skipped by them. Yue Qi did not make a habit of trading talismans, but he had alluded to his ‘friend’ having gotten some such things in the city, and so with news of the bookseller he sold a few water heating talismans for actual coin and then set out on the road. He offered Shen Qingqiu a quick explanation about an interesting trader, and a promise to return swiftly. Even with swift strides the trip took more than a day on foot. Luck was with Yue Qi however. and he found the seller on the road.</p><p> </p><p>The man’s books were not bestiaries or cultivation manuals or high philosophy, but he had some books of poetry and romantic epics that were decently bound and not already on Shen Jiu’s shelves. Yue Qi bought all he could afford. He carefully wrapped the books before discreetly placing them into his storage pouch, then made the return trip back in record time.</p><p> </p><p>It was dusk when he arrived home. Despite all the walking he had done there was still a spring in his step, and even the necessary weight of Xuan Su at his back felt lighter than usual. He only paused when he spotted a shadowy figure moving around the chicken coop.</p><p> </p><p>A thief?</p><p> </p><p>“Hey!” Yue Qi shouted. He used a light talisman.</p><p> </p><p>There was a startled oath. Any alarm was replaced with surprise as Shen Jiu hurried up from where he had been crouching beside the coop fence. Looking down, Yue Qi saw that some damage had been done to it.</p><p> </p><p>He also saw that it had been patched over.</p><p> </p><p>“Xiao Jiu?” he asked. “What are you doing out here in the dark?”</p><p> </p><p>Shen Jiu gave him an arch look.</p><p> </p><p>“It just got darker than I realized while I was working,” he said. “I was fixing the fence. That wild dog that’s been nosing around managed to pry part of it open, and I didn’t want any of our investments getting eaten by mangy strays.”</p><p> </p><p>Chickens were valuable, it was true, but Shen Jiu had also made it clear on several occasions that he could buy a hundred over and not make a dent in his own money. Yue Qi doubted he would have considered buying a new chicken or two any more hassle than going out in the dark to try and patch up a fence by himself.</p><p> </p><p>But if a dog had killed any of his chickens, Yue Qi would have been terribly sad. He couldn't even bring himself to consider cooking any of them. Even when they were too old to keep laying eggs he supposed he would just keep them around for company instead.</p><p> </p><p>Something in him softened.</p><p> </p><p>It softened further when Shen Jiu gave him a firm look-over, as if checking for damages, and then folded his arms across his chest.</p><p> </p><p>“...You came back,” he noted then. “…Early. I thought you would be gone until tomorrow.”</p><p> </p><p>“En. Qi-ge made good time,” he replied with a smile.</p><p> </p><p>A quick check of the fence confirmed that it was patched well enough for the night. In the morning he could fix it properly. Yue Qi took Shen Jiu back inside the main house, and waited until the other man turned away before hurriedly emptying his purchased books onto the table. The table was his first attempt at a carpentry project more complex than some shelves. It had been good practice for the writing desk, but despite his best efforts it always wobbled a little. Even so, Shen Jiu had yet to demand that it be replaced. When the weight of the books settled the table sure enough wobbled, and the sound unconsciously drew Shen Jiu’s eye.</p><p> </p><p>He came up short.</p><p> </p><p>“What’s this?” he asked.</p><p> </p><p>“There was a bookseller,” Yue Qi explained. “Such merchants don’t often pass through here, so it seemed prudent to go and see what he might have.” Of course Shen Jiu already knew that most of the books that any traders brought along to this area were… well. Not generally of interest to him. News was carried by imperial officials of course - unless it was carried by gossips instead - and the books sold to locals were small and filled with basic information or simplified transcripts of plays or epics, sometimes inaccurate ‘cultivation manuals’ or the like. Rarely anything that would have been considered good enough for the study's shelves. Thus the bookseller was an important opportunity.</p><p> </p><p>Shen Jiu’s cheeks got just a little bit more pink.</p><p> </p><p>“As if I can’t simply go to the city whenever I please and find books there,” he scoffed. “Ridiculous. Qi-ge left me in such a hurry for a reason like <em>this?”</em></p><p> </p><p>Yue Qi’s excitement faltered. He felt that softness again, and also just the faintest twinge of regret. Hadn’t Shen Jiu told him before that he thought he would leave? Perhaps he shouldn’t have been so quick to set out…</p><p> </p><p>“Did Xiao Jiu worry?” he asked.</p><p> </p><p>Shen Jiu glared at him.</p><p> </p><p>“Of course not,” he said. “What could even come close to challenging someone like you on the roads here? Don’t be absurd. I just don’t think this was worth such a trip. These books aren’t even any good, I can get their like any time I please. There’s no reason for Qi-ge to go or to spend his own money. Isn’t he poor again now?”</p><p> </p><p>Even though the words were harsh, they made Yue Qi smile.</p><p> </p><p>“Very poor,” he agreed. Looking down at the table he reached for the stack. “Qi-ge spent all his coins on these books. Ah, it’s a shame Xiao Jiu doesn’t like them… maybe someone in the village will trade for them...”</p><p> </p><p>Shen Jiu’s scowl deepened. He moved a step closer towards the table and raised a hand as if to stop him. A beat passed. Then he realized he had been caught out. Yue Qi bit back a smile, and Shen Jiu lifted his chin.</p><p> </p><p>“No one in the village will pay well for such things. Qi-ge might as well just leave them with me. Even if it’s foolish, he got them for me didn’t he?”</p><p> </p><p>“Mn. He did,” Yue Qi confirmed.</p><p> </p><p>Shen Jiu nodded.</p><p> </p><p>“Then the books are mine. Just think things through better next time.”</p><p> </p><p>Yue Qi ducked his head in acknowledgement, still fighting back a smile. Shen Jiu knew full well what had happened and treated him to an unsuccessful attempt at a withering glare, before he nevertheless carefully gathered all of the books up and whisked them away to his study.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p>
