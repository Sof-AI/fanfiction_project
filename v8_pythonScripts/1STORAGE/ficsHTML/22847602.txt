    <p>
  <span>“If we take in more people, the sects really are going to think we're building an army,” Wei Wuxian said. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Wen Qing didn't say anything. She was exhausted and didn’t know how Wei WuXian was still moving with such frenetic energy. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“But this is supposed to be a refuge and a safe place, not just another prison camp. I can’t…  it can't be that if we don't let the people who need that safety get in, or the people who want freedom more than safety out.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She continued to just sit and stare at him as he paced. It had been two days of hard riding to get to the Burial Mound, hiding from pursuit, soaked through with rain, starving before they ever set out, and somehow still collecting other refugees who had been hiding in the countryside. They paid their way into the party by bringing with them small packets of food and blankets and rags that could still be used to keep warm. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“But if we let some of them come in, other people might try to sneak in. And we can't exactly vet each refugee on whether or not they were a Wen non-combatant.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She wished she had a cup of tea. She really wanted a cup of tea. Of course, she might as well be wishing for her own fully stocked apothecary stores while she was at it. There was a small but steady trickle of people, mostly civilian members of cultivation families who had scattered into hiding but desperate to find someplace to run to rather than simply run from. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And at least some of the people who are coming aren't even Wen but still need shelter.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Some of them were probably criminals who were simply hoping for a chance to start over with a new name and new circumstances. They had to be incredibly desperate or incredibly stupid to consider joining the train of fleeing Wn refugees. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He finally collapsed onto one of the rocks he had taken to using as a chair in the cave he had claimed as his domicile. "This is why I was never intended to lead a Sect. I can come up with plenty of possibilities to advise Jiang Cheng about but how is anyone supposed to make a decision?"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He stuttered slightly at his brother’s name but didn't acknowledge it so she didn't either.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She waited a bit longer to make sure he was done. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"You make the best choices you can with the information you have. And try to live with the consequences." She grimaced a bit at that. "I'm not exactly a shining example of successful decision making." </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He huffed a laugh at that. "And here we are."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"What do you want to do?" She finally asked. She was a logical person but logic hadn't done well by her, if this was the result of keeping her head down and behaving with honor during the war. That logic had brought her here. Wei Wuxian seemed more impulse driven but maybe his impulses would give them better results. Of course, his impulses had also brought him here too, so maybe not.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She had gone searching wildly for her brother and had found Wei WuXian instead. Wei WuXian had found not just her brother but two dozen other Wen survivors. And their mad flight had collected another dozen or so. Neither she nor Wei WuXian had ever been raised to lead but they were both of a class where everyone was raised to command. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Wei WuXian finally shrugged. "Let them in if they say they'll behave. Kick them out or kill them if they don't behave." </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"That's fine as long as it's just a few, but will be trouble if larger groups show up."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Then let's hope that it's only ever just a few." </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Hope hasn't done well for me in the past."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Hasn't it?" </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She shrugged. Who knew? It could have been worse: she had found her little brother and Wei WuXian had sworn that he could bring back his consciousness, even as a fierce corpse. She didn’t know if she trusted him, but she had to hope. She had to believe that it could have been worse. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It could have been a lot better though. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Actually, why am I asking you? Your luck and decision making is as bad as mine. I’ll just ask the rest of the Wen. They’ll be the most in danger, after all.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Wen Qing felt a bit guilty about not thinking of that herself. But in the end, the rest of the Wen mulled over the idea of others coming to them, and as wary as they all were of strangers, they had a point: “they’ll bring supplies and news.” And an even better point, “If they’re coming here, they’re probably pretty desperate.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>So Wei WuXian’s border guard of corpses acted as a warning system that allowed him to see who arrived later rather than a solid barrier to stop anyone who approached. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>In the meantime, the group that arrived with them were already blended. Wen Qing personally recognized most of the refugees from the original prison camp, but not all of them, just as she recognized some of the later additions although not most of them. The wild ride had made compatriots of even the previous strangers. They were in this together one way or another. And if a few stragglers showed up later, they’d likely be welcomed and become part of the group soon enough through the shared hardship of living in the cursed Burial Mounds. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But they had arrived, all of them, safely away from pursuit and slaughter, for now at least. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They had arrived and collapsed into the caves and ancient abandoned structures to sleep as best they could while Wei WuXian had raised a guard of corpses to encircle the whole mountain. The next day they had eaten wild roots and mushrooms and tried to get the energy to do anything to do anything else. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>One of the probable criminals who had joined the group midway had sworn that he’d be able to trade the stolen horses for basic supplies to help them get established and actually surprised Wen Qing by returning, without horses and with supplies. He brought more blankets and rice and a random assortment of old tools that the rest of the survivors had gathered around and carefully inspected and distributed among them based on who was doing what. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Everyone mostly organized themselves and got to work scavenging for food and firewood, clearing out abandoned buildings to make more suitable living quarters, and a few hopeful souls starting gardens to grow fresh food.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They needed medicines. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The first day Wen Qing had scavenged for food like most everyone else, but even then she’d collected medicinal herbs as well, as best she could. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They needed food, and housing, and to deal with the suffocating resentful energy permeating everything, but they also needed medicine and Wen Qing was the best and obvious choice to focus on that. She felt guilty for it, that she could continue to work on her calling, while few of the others could do the same.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But they gave her deference for nothing more than being Wen Qing, the highest ranking member of the surviving Wen family. The least she could do was to give them medical care. Absolutely none of them begrudged her focus on medicine. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Nor did any of them, Wen Qing herself included, begrudge Wei WuXian’s focus on dealing with the resentful energy and cultivation experiments. What he managed to accomplish with his talismans and flute playing was infinitely more valuable to them than the same amount of time spent weeding or watering the fields, although he insisted on helping with that too. His help was approximately as helpful as A-Yuan’s help, as far as farming went, but he did manage to keep A-Yuan entertained whenever Granny needed a break. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It still felt different for her to focus all of her attention on medicine and yet still eat the food of other’s labor. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Many of the remaining members of the Wen clan were old and would have needed medicine even if they hadn't lived such rough lives these past few years. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And Wei WuXian was a medical anomaly all of his own: not just a war veteran with those related problems but the only known survivor of golden core removal, and hopefully the first of many survivors of the Burial Mounds’ resentful energy. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They needed medicines.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They needed medicines, but couldn’t even afford to buy food.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But they had Wen Qing and she was determined that that would be enough. She was the greatest doctor in all the land and if she had to trade the skills that had once earned her gold and honors for a few small packets of herbs from a nameless village apothecary, she would do so. What use had she with honor after her time begging for help and starving in the streets?</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It turns out that the village at the base of the Burial Mounds didn't even have an apothecary. They had a small market with a few small stalls from local herb gardens. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She had never been in this situation before, but she would make do. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She spoke to each of the people at the stalls and told them what she needed and promised treatment and knowledge in exchange. And she had to deliver first. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>So she taught them. She recited Wen secret medical lore for hours, allowing the local scribe to write it down, even correcting his characters and drawing the illustrations herself. She treated their elderly and their injured, using her needles and what medicines they had or that she could make. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And after a lifetime of living with high sect politics and then a year of being a scorned and hunted refugee, she was stunned at the way the whole impoverished village of ordinary people came together around her. She was still an outsider, but a cherished and valued one. They assigned her three of their children, two boys and a girl, to be her assistants and apprentices, to learn everything she could teach them, whenever she was in-town although none of them would venture past the border guard of corpses to go into the Burial Mounds themselves. She was doing something and ensuring that at least some of the knowledge of the Wen doctors survived. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Then Wen Ning woke up and knew her face, knew her name.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She had worked hard and hoped and was being rewarded for it. A-Ning was aware and all the people he had left behind when he died were still alive to great him back into awareness. He had friends and she had purpose again, and it felt like the sun had finally come out from behind the clouds in the cursed and overcast Burial Mounds. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She didn’t think she’d ever been happier in her life. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ten herb gardens were completely redone based on her needs and seeds were acquired from the city a three days walk away by an illiterate soapmaker who's father needed a medicine that could be created once the plants had grown. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As she taught their children all about herbs and medicine making and medical techniques both basic and arcane, the villagers kept her up to date on what gossip from the rest of the world they could find. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was only a matter of time before the rumor mill caught up with them. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"People are saying that the Yiling Patriarch stole Wen Qing away as his personal physician and is keeping the Wen remnants as hostages to her good behavior." </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"People are saying that Wen Qing is the true heir of Wen RuoHan and corrupted the Yiling Patriarch as revenge for the slaying of her previous lord."</span>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"People are saying that Wen Qing used her feminine wiles to seduce the Yiling Patriarch..."</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Wen Qing had to interrupt that one, because seriously, "anyone who thinks feminine wiles would work on Wei WuXian doesn't know him very well." </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was also one of the days when Wei WuXian had accompanied her and Wen Qing had a suspicion, from the glint in this particular auntie’s eye, that she had saved that bit of gossip until he had been present to hear it too. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Hey!" Wei WuXian acted insulted. "What is that supposed to mean?"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Wen Qing rolled her eyes. Wei WuXian was flirty but also an idiot and she was not going to be the one who told him that he only ever had eyes for one person and that person wasn't feminine at all. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"You think you'd succumb to my feminine wiles?" she said instead, and the auntie who’d shared the gossip had laughed at the corner Wei WuXian had backed himself into. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"I'm too strong for that!" </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Yeah, yeah." She agreed with overacted disbelief and most of the villagers who were listening in continuing to poke fun at the good natured Wei WuXian. In truth, though, Wen Qing knew that Wei WuXian really was too strong for that. Because she had seen him deny Lan WangJi. It had broken his heart to do so, and in that rainy night she had been viciously glad that someone else's heart was as broken as hers, but he had refused to go against his sense of right because of love. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The support of the small village also protected them, at least a little, from the con artists who tried to attach themselves to Wei WuXian’s reputation. There were still self-proclaimed disciples of the Grandmaster of Demonic Cultivation in some of the other villages that their members went to for a larger market in which to sell their radishes. But none of them too close.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Those that actually showed up at the Burial Mounds with the intent of actually becoming Wei WuXian’s disciples never lasted more than a day. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Wei WuXian would invite them in if they came baring a suitable gift (food or blankets or something else that would make life better for their settlement) and take them to the edge of one of the thick fogs of resentment in the Burial Mounds.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Identify a single spirit, find out it’s name and what it needs to be put to rest, and I might take you as my disciple,” Wei WuXian would say in a particularly pompous tone of voice that Wen Qing was fairly sure was a mockery of Lan QiRen’s.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The prospective disciples would invariably say, “What?” and then try to argue that they should be rousing the spirits in mass rather than trying to put them individually to rest.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Only a few of them even made the attempt to follow his order and none of them did very well. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Wei WuXian always laughed at their attempts and then cast them out to return to their ordinary lives thoroughly demoralized. “How can you expect to command masses if you can’t even identify one? Hahaha!” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They were always gone before Wei WuXian showed any sign of how demoralized he was by their failures as well. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He'd been trying to calm the spirits of the Burial Mounds every day since they had arrived. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He was the only one who could do it, although several of the uncles and one of the aunts did their best to support him how they could. Wei WuXian assured Wen Qing that he was acting as carefully as he could, but it was recklessly by anyone else's standards, identifying a few individual spirits, pulling them free from the masses of anger and resentment of the mounds, and guiding them to peaceful rest. Or casting them down and destroying them utterly, depending on their situation. But it was an endless task in this centuries old mound of abandoned enemy corpses, but they were doing what they could in the hope that one day it would make a difference.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They sent out information as they were able to. The names and dates that they could, to let the home sects of the deceased know what had happened. If the home sects had even survived the battles that left their ancestors roaming and trapped in the Burial Mounds. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>As the person with the best handwriting, Second aunt wrote most of the letters based on Wei WuXian’s chicken scratch notes. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Second aunt wrote the messages and whoever was going into town would arrange for delivery but never waited for any response or reply. It was too dangerous to let anyone know when a member of the Burial Mounds had left the immediate protection of that place or when Wei WuXian himself was absent.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>But sometimes that was all the spirits needed: to have their losses acknowledged, have their descendants know they died and didn't desert. Those times, the spirits showed that a message was received by their reactions to finally being properly mourned by their descendents. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Of all the various rogue cultivators, potential disciples, and sect cultivator invaders who came by to take their chances with the Burial Mound refugees, only one of them had the determination to succeed in actually being helpful. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Most such cultivators, both rogue and sect, tested the boundary of corpse guards and then turned back. This one stayed, harassing the border guard until Wei WuXian himself showed up. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She said, “I’m not going to be your disciple, but I’ve heard of your challenge to potential disciples and I want to try.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And you thought the best way to get my attention was to keep destroying the corpses that I have guarding my border?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, I needed a way to get your attention. And keep myself from getting bored while waiting for you.” She said was obviously intentional rudeness, clearly a test of his patience while she still had freedom at her back. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She was rude and fearless, had an ugly scar bisecting her face, and was old enough to be his mother. Wei WuXian liked her. “I’m Wei WuXian.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yeah, I know.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“And what should I call you?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hien.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Just Hien?”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Yes.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Then welcome to the Burial Mounds, Cultivator Hien.” And he parted his guard of corpses with a bow to allow her to enter. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Cultivator Hien looked thoroughly and intentionally unimpressed as she walked through, masking any trepidation she might have had to enter such a cursed place. But she followed readily enough and clearly tried her best to summon out a single spirit from the mass of resentful energy. She didn’t succeed but it was a good enough attempt that he allowed her to watch as he summoned one out, showing her how he did it. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She thanked him and left but was back a month later, destroying more of his guard corpses before asking to be allowed in to try again. Even Wen Ning seemed amused by the sheer audacity of it. Wei WuXian let her in again and she stayed the night that time, trying and failing twice to summon out an individual spirit. She was grumpy as she left but turned down the invitation to stay longer. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I’m going to master this, but I’m not staying anywhere unless I can actually be useful.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“You think I’m the only useful person here?” Wei WuXian asked, wondering if the woman wanted Wen Qing to smite her dead, or maybe just never eat or sleep here ever again.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Clearly not. But I’m not good at anything but cultivation so I need to be able to do useful cultivation.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, I’ll look forward to seeing you when you return.” He still didn’t ask why she had come and why she was determined to gain this one skill that wasn’t even one of his famous skills. Who had she lost that she hoped to find here? Or who had she lost in some other pit of resentful energy that she hoped to call forth from there? Everyone in the cultivation world had lost one or many in the wars. Maybe it was even a long infiltration mission, getting into his good graces like Meng Yao had gotten into Wen RuoHan’s court. He didn’t ask any of those questions and she didn’t offer any answers, and he wasn’t surprised when she showed up again in another month’s time. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was the fourth time when she finally succeeded in identifying one of the Burial Mound ghosts and laying it to rest. She stayed for a full week in celebration and even put up with some of Wei WuXian’s drunken rhapsodies regarding Lan Zhan, which most of the rest of the residents had long since taken to ignoring. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>She still left, but the fifth month she showed up again with five disciples from the Yuen sect. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The Yuen sect disciples arrived with a large bronze gong. They built a rough hut right outside the boundary to the Burial Mounds, placed the gong in it, and proceeded to hit it until Wei WeXian finally finally came down to see what was going on. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The Yuen didn’t do politics, they were an ancient sect from the Unclean Realm that had gone into a serious decline some generations back. Wei WuXian was kind of surprised it was still big enough to send five disciples out. It was a group of five powerful disciples dressed for a funeral, carrying the goods for a funeral as well, from the tables to the incense. They were young and powerful and could easily become a fighting force and yet…, Cultivator Hien smirked at him from behind them. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"We will not deny a funeral procession. Do not become a military attack, and be welcome to honor your ancestors." </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They were allowed into the Burial Grounds and pulled out supplies and started a funeral ceremony that lasted eight days and eight nights and soothed a lost army of Yuen ancestors. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“So, Yuen Hien?” Wen Qing asked. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“No,” Cultivator Hien stated, but then shrugged. “Do rogue cultivating long enough, one starts to make connections.” </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Hmm.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The Yuen disciples came with a pair of beautiful, ancient, and very valuable vases to give to the Yiling Patriarch in payment for allowing their presence and funeral rites.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They were beautiful and it was proper and Wei WuXian wanted for once in his life to do the proper thing and accept them and pretend he was a proper part of the cultivation world. But a poor man such as himself had no right to such propriety and instead he found the well of shamelessness he had kept as a younger man and said, "These are beautiful, but may I request that instead of these gifts, you give me the funeral table and incense burner. Because that is what we need more than any decoration, no matter how ancient or beautiful." </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There had been pity in the eyes of the disciple who agreed and it made Wei WuXian want to rage, but he tamped it down. He was halfway to a resentful spirit himself and he wished Lan WangJi were here to play clarity for him. Or maybe to play Inquiry for him like any other spirit. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The head disciple had also clearly seen the tremble in Wei WuXian's hands as they poured the alcohol for their ancestors and gifted him with an extra bottle of it.</span>
  <span> </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Wei WuXian wanted. He wanted that alcohol so much. He wanted to pour it down his throat and sooth the headache and the tremble and the fear and the anger and everything that was so overwhelming. He wanted it desperately. In other circumstances he might have wanted it more than anything, but in these circumstances there were things he wanted more.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He held the jars only briefly as he thanked the disciple and then passed them to Wen Qing to keep for her apothecary and for their own funeral rites. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The Yuen were the first funeral procession but not the last. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Word spread. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Other small sects with ancient histories came to hold funerals although Wei WuXian and Wen Qing judged that at least half of those funerals were held mostly for the purpose of checking out the status of the refugee settlement with the intent of a future invasion. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>And yet, they couldn't deny the families of the dead the possibility of making peace anymore than they could deny themselves the chance to sooth the dead they lived in siege against. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>It was always interesting to see who would show up, though. There was some betting going on among the refugees. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Would it be powerful young disciples who had a chance to fight their way out in case the evil Yiling Patriarch tried anything nefarious? (Or in case they saw a chance to push an impromptu invasion?) </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Or would it be old and weak sect members whose loss would be mourned but not be devastating to the strength of the injured sect? No few of those arrived already in such poor condition that it almost seemed like an attempt to claim the Yiling patriarch's responsibility for an inevitable death. Wen Qing's medical skills were both blessing and curse for this, as she insisted on treating such visitors who regularly left in better condition than they had arrived. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Some of them even begged to not leave at all, but Wei Wuxian and Wen Qing agreed that even as they accepted refugees, they did not allow any sect members to stay. If a sect member wished for permanent residence in the Burial Mounds, they had to formally withdraw from their own sect before begging for entrance to the Burial Mounds like any other refugee. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Will you guarantee me entrance after that?"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"We can't even guarantee our lives. How would we guarantee your acceptance?"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"But you're asking me to leave my sect before you even agree to accept me into yours?"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"I'm not asking you to do anything. Leaving your sect was your idea, remember?"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"But I want to join yours!"</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>"Then you'd better be prepared to live with risk." </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Sect members tended not to join. Even the refugees who showed up were only ever the most desperate ones with nowhere else to turn. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The refugees of the Burial Mounds were making a life for themselves, but it was within a morass of resentful energy, in a cursed land, and the target of regular attacks, although the attacks  were slowly trailing off, half-hearted and mostly information gathering. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>They had food and some goods for trade and a purpose in cleansing the Burial Mounds. They were few and hurt but they were finding peace. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Then an invitation to attend Jin Ling’s one-month celebration arrived for Wei WuXian. He hadn’t seen his shijie in two years and he was so excited about the chance. He spent a month working on a present. Looking at Wei Wuxian’s smile was like looking at the sun. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>So they all looked at one another, instead, with worry and fear. </span>
