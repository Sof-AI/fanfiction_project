<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <strong>-</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>01. Defiant<br/></strong>The Detective never looks away, not once. Unflinching, unyielding, unashamed – it is both pleasing and comforting, amusing, in its own way.</p>
<p>"Eyes on me, Detective." The boy smiles, and something of it reaches his eyes.</p>
<p>"Always."</p>
<p><strong>02. Powder<br/></strong>Tim coughs, the old dilapidated building creaking and groaning around him as he picks his way through debris. Of all the times for communications to be down, Tim winces, pain shooting up his right leg. He taps his ear communicator again, gets nothing but static.</p>
<p>"Ah, there you are." Tim blinks, eyes stinging from dust. He considers saying, <em>this is a private line</em> or <em>you shouldn't be on our frequencies</em>, perhaps something to the extent of <em>what the hell do you want</em>. He doesn't. Instead, he sighs, resting his weight against a wall that he hopes won't collapse and replies -</p>
<p>"Yes. Here I am. Please, send assistance."</p>
<p><strong>03. Grateful<br/></strong>He wonders if it's in bad manners to refuse a gift. It's an <em>unwanted</em> gift – but a gift, none-the-less. It's a gift from an enemy. Granted, an enemy who he's worked with and entertains a certain sort of…<em>something</em> with.</p>
<p>Tim pokes at the vehicle with the tip of his bo staff, and is only half-surprised when it doesn't explode or release some sort of gas. He reaches up to the ear piece he's kept on almost every night since Paris -</p>
<p>"Thank you, I think. I've always wanted…a lime green vespa."</p>
<p><strong>04. Decent<br/></strong>Tim flushes, grabbing Ra's by the wrist before anyone can notice either of their presences and pulls him out of Bruce's line of sight.</p>
<p>"Are you <em>insane</em>?" He hisses through his teeth, ducking his head around the doorway to make sure that everyone is still caught up in entertaining the various socialites and media parties present. "I mean, great – you've just returned to your prime after your dip in the fountain of youth, but do you have to <em>flaunt it in front of B?</em>"</p>
<p>The older man (who looks to only be around Bruce's age, maybe younger, now) blinks, like he's completely innocent.</p>
<p>"Was it wrong of me to wish to see you, my beloved, and hope that my appearance would please you?"</p>
<p>"Your appearance only pleases me when it's at an appropriate time and venue. How did you live to be so long when you have such <em>horrible timing</em>?"</p>
<p><strong>05. Union<br/></strong>"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today –"</p>
<p>Tim's face, covered by the veil, is pinched as he hisses under his breath. "Neither of us is even religious."</p>
<p>Ra's ignores him, listening to whatever it is the ninja is whispering in his ear while the vicar rambles on.</p>
<p>"- to join together this man and this…man in holy matrimony, which is – "</p>
<p>He can't breathe in this dress. The next time Ra's abducts him for elopement he's going to convince <em>someone</em> about the practicalities of <em>not putting him in a dress</em>. Namely that he won't feel like <em>passing out</em> mid-ceremony or feel like stabbing someone with a high heel.</p>
<p>Ra's waves his hand, "Apologies, we are on a schedule. If you could move onwards to the end, that would be most appreciated."</p>
<p>The priest looks nervous, looks to Tim like <em>he</em> has any say in this. Tim shrugs because the effort of breathing is getting pretty hard to focus on. He clears his throat, before nervously skipping forward -</p>
<p>"Who gives this…man in marriage to this – "</p>
<p>"Further along."</p>
<p>"Do you – "</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>The priest looks very disturbed at this point, and Tim wonders why he wasn't disturbed at <em>any point before this one</em>. He turns to Tim, almost pitying and well, at least, <em>someone</em> understands how he feels -</p>
<p>"And do you – "</p>
<p>"Irrelevant." Ra's cuts him off, Tim glares through his veil and snaps -</p>
<p>"Excuse me. <em>Relevant</em>. And <em>yes</em>."</p>
<p>"That is rather surprising, beloved."</p>
<p>"<em>Moving on.</em>"</p>
<p>"I now pronounce you husband…and husband. You may kiss the…groom."</p>
<p>"Already done." Ra's turns, swooping Tim up into his arms, ignoring Tim's snapped protests, "Prepare the car."</p>
<p>As they leave the building Tim pinches the bridge of his nose, "I swear you only do this for the honeymoon."</p>
<p><strong>06. Cleansed<br/></strong>Gotham is bathed in the light of fire and flashing blue-red police lights, echoes with the sound of sirens and rushing helicopter blades.</p>
<p>But all the roaring tides of the ocean couldn't drown out, wash out, the sound of Ra's victory or fill the silence of Tim's absence.</p>
<p><strong>07. Go<br/></strong>"I don't need you following me around <em>everywhere I go</em>." Tim holds the door closed against the ninja attempting to open it, mentally cursing Ra's to every single torment he can think of. "I mean. I'm not going to slip and crack my skull taking a <em>shower</em>. I'm one hundred percent certain that I'm not going to be assassinated or assaulted if you just wait outside."</p>
<p>The door knob continues to rattle. "Sir, if you do not open this door we have been given orders to break it down."</p>
<p>Tim congratulates himself on not stabbing anyone with the hidden knives he keeps underneath the bathroom sink.</p>
<p>"Can we compromise? I'll open the door, but you stay outside, don't look in, and I promise to scream if anything happens?"</p>
<p>There's silence on the other side before a ninja replies -</p>
<p>"The master will only acquiesce if you agree to cameras being installed to monitor you."</p>
<p><em>"For the love of –</em>"</p>
<p><strong>08. Shame<br/></strong>He carries his marks with his head held high, shoulders thrown back, calm acceptance on his lips. As he walks through Ra's fortress, loose shirt that isn't his draped over his shoulders, flowing black pants hanging low on his hips, he shows the colored marks on his skin without regret or embarrassment.</p>
<p>Because he knows that he has returned them upon their maker, two fold.</p>
<p><strong>09. Objective<br/></strong>"I swear, sometimes I think your only goal in life is to give me ulcers or something. I don't want to think about the <em>or something</em>. Stop looking at me like that. No – no, don't pull that innocent look on me. You're, frankly, too old for it to work. By definition, Ra's al Ghul is incapable of pulling the innocent look. By <em>definition</em>. No – no, stop that. That isn't an <em>excuse</em> for you to – "</p>
<p>Tim throws his hands up in the air as Ra's descend on his hips.</p>
<p>"Fine. Whatever. I give up. <em>Ugh</em>. You are such a stubborn <em>goat</em>."</p>
<p><strong>10. Strength<br/></strong>There are many types of strength – and his Detective possesses several of them. Ra's trails his fingers over Timothy's side, raises an eyebrow at Timothy's narrowed eyes. Timothy swings a leg over Ra's hip, fluidly moving onto his knees and perching on his lap. Strength of form.</p>
<p>"You keep me up at night then you refuse to let me sleep in the mornings." Ra's taps his fingers on top of Timothy's thigh as the Detective crosses his arms, tilts his head. "I'm beginning to think this is a ploy to deprive me of sleep and make me go insane."</p>
<p>"I would think it would not be so simple." Strength of spirit and strength of mind. "You are much harder to break than that."</p>
<p>Timothy yawns, sliding off Ra's and back onto the bed, eyes slipping closed. "Such a flatterer."</p>
<p><strong>11. Life<br/></strong>He is called a murderer, a terrorist. But he does it for the sake of life.</p>
<p>What he does is – usually – illegal. Debatably immoral.</p>
<p>What does that make Tim?</p>
<p><strong>12. Contempt<br/></strong>"Your blatant disregard for my welfare is astounding." Tim declares as Ra's makes himself at home in <em>Tim's</em> home. "Someday someone – Bruce, Dick, I don't know, maybe Cass, is going to wander in here. See you. Not see me, because when this day comes I will make sure to be as <em>far away from here as possible</em>. And they will probably flip the ever loving <em>fuck</em> out."</p>
<p>"Language."</p>
<p>"You aren't my parent, and if you were that would be <em>horrible</em> of you to be <em>fucking </em>me. Anyway. After their initial flip out they will hunt me down and lock me up in the most secure location they can find and it will drive me insane. I repeat. Your concern for my wellbeing is fantastically lacking. Get out of my house."</p>
<p><strong>13. Wrong<br/></strong>Is it wrong? Undoubtedly.</p>
<p>Does it feel good? <em>Obviously</em>.</p>
<p>Does he regret a single moment of this? Not until after he leaves.</p>
<p><strong>14. Sweeten<br/></strong>Tim's smile is one hundred percent fake, plastic, and manufactured when he tosses it at the flashing cameras.</p>
<p>"And who is this gentleman with you tonight, Mr. Drake-Wayne?" The hand on his hip slides lower before Tim pointedly removes himself from Ra's arms.</p>
<p>"An acquaintance who hasn't been in town in a very long time. We've just been catching up." Ra's hand catches his wrist, long fingers warm and gentle as he raises Tim's hand to brush a kiss along his knuckles. The camera flashes are blinding. Tim's eyes narrow, though his smile doesn't slip. "He's foreign."</p>
<p>Lips press to the inside of his wrist, sliding the sleeve of his dress shirt and suit away to reveal more skin. There are spots in Tim's vision from cameras and there are microphones being <em>shoved in his face – </em>Ra's turns him away from them, arm sliding around his waist, leading him into a restaurant that <em>Tim had no intention of going into, god he was just going home for the night – </em>and addresses the media over their shoulders, eyes not once leaving Tim's face.</p>
<p>"If you would excuse us, there is much that we must catch up on. My beloved and I, that is."</p>
<p><strong>15. Hands<br/></strong>Ra's holds his wrists, thumbs gently brushing over the pale blue veins that show through, gentle and almost absent minded as he raises Tim's hands to his lips. Tim bites down on his lip to suppress the jolt of surprise when the man presses his lips to each digit, tongue sliding against Tim's skin – hot, hot, <em>hot</em>.</p>
<p>He watches, fascinated, as the man <em>worships</em> his hands, takes the involuntary twitch of his fingers with a small smile, presses his thumbs to Tim's bones, and tongues at the skin between fingers.</p>
<p>Tim wonders if he will be allowed to return the favor.</p>
<p><strong>16. Strangle<br/></strong>"It's not like <em>I knew</em> he would do that!" Tim snaps, pressing his face into a pillow and repressing the urge to scream as the television blares about <em>Timothy Drake-Wayne's exotic, elder, boyfriend</em>. "I was – I was going <em>home</em> and I didn't – <em>ugh</em>."</p>
<p>Damian is swearing, fluently and without pause, in at least <em>four</em> languages that Tim can catch, Bruce is giving him a <em>look</em>, and Dick is just staring at the television in slack-jawed horror.</p>
<p>Abruptly, Dick reaches out and grasps Tim's shoulder, "Please tell me that you two <em>haven't</em> actually – <em>you know</em>."</p>
<p>Tim does not resist his urge to smack Dick in the face, scream <em>of course we haven't</em>, then bring the pillow back to his own face and <em>scream again</em>.</p>
<p><strong>17. Lullaby<br/></strong>Long fingers wind through his hair, gently tracing scar tissue, petting. He can't distinguish the words – although he knows the speaker – that are being said, sung. But it sounds nice.</p>
<p>The hand readjusts the towel on his forehead, fingers lingering at his temple – the voice continuing to sing, hum. Tim tries to open his eyes, instead slips into deeper sleep.</p>
<p><strong>18. Untouchable<br/></strong>The problem with this relationship, Tim thinks, is that Ra's would make him into something he <em>isn't.</em> Ra's would take him and build him up into some sort of powerful being. Give him tools and training and means to stay out of the fighting, to becomes some sort of <em>legend</em> or person of fame and repute.</p>
<p>That would be nice.</p>
<p>But it wouldn't be Tim.</p>
<p>Tim belongs here, in the dark and in the dirt. Getting his hands covered in blood and filth, getting dirty and mean right along with the criminals he puts behind bars. This is where Tim <em>thrives</em> – multiple faces, multiple voices, a thousand regimes at the touch of his fingers. Not up somewhere doing one on one battles, earning names and titles.</p>
<p>It's here. Where names are nothing but layers of shed skin and titles are lies.</p>
<p>Ra's would have him be word of mouth and shadow.</p>
<p>Tim is blood and bone. There is nothing special about that.</p>
<p><strong>19. Whispered<br/></strong>In the privacy of their bedroom, behind the drapes that shield their bed, trapped underneath the weight of Ra's arms, pushed against the furnace of his blood and bone and skin -</p>
<p>Tim can admit, relinquish the truth, "Yes."</p>
<p>Yes to everything Ra's can ever offer, yes to everything Ra's could ever ask, yes, <em>yes, yes - </em></p>
<p>But here, and only here, can he say it. Out in the world – the world where he is more than his emotions, more than his needs – he would deny ever having said it.</p>
<p>And Ra's would never ask.</p>
<p>(He is not the only one with appearances to hold.)</p>
<p><strong>20. Prayers<br/></strong>As they pass through the compounds halls, Tim thinks that there's something <em>fanatical </em>in the absolute devotion displayed by Ra's minions. Unquestionable, unshakable, unmistakable.</p>
<p>Tim follows at Ra's side, eyes taking this all in, and laughing.</p>
<p>There are those who would kill to be in Tim's place – in his position at Ra's side, in his ear, and, of course, in his bed – but it is because Tim couldn't care less that it is <em>him</em> who is here.</p>
<p>What is a god to a non-believer?</p>
<p>Mortal.</p>
<p><strong>21. Obvious<br/></strong>"Is there somewhere you need to be, Tim?" Bruce narrows his eyes at his middle child, who fidgets, fingers twitching inwards. When Tim gets anxious about time he doesn't look for clocks or watches (Bruce knows that Tim's internal clock is accurate enough to conduct trains with), his fingers twitch in count.</p>
<p>Tim looks pained when he answers, "Yes." Mutters, like Bruce can't hear, "Unfortunately."</p>
<p>"Do you…need an excuse not to go?" For a second Tim perks up, then his face sours.</p>
<p>"That would be nice. It wouldn't work. But it'd be nice." Tim slumps his shoulders. "Excuses never work on him."</p>
<p>Bruce is about to ask <em>him?</em> when Tim stands, straightens his jacket, and moves towards the door just as Alfred opens it, giving Tim a pointed look and Bruce a dry one.</p>
<p>"There is…a ninja waiting for Master Timothy outside. And. These." Alfred holds up a bouquet of tulips. "Were brought for you as well, young sir."</p>
<p>Tim looks like he's going to be physically sick, but takes them anyway. "Thanks, Alfred. If I'm not back in sixteen hours, I want you to know that I really will miss your <em>everything</em>."</p>
<p><strong>22. Rhythm<br/></strong>Ra's hands on his hips guide his movements, voice low as he counts the steps. Tim's hands rest, uncertain on the man's broader shoulders, brows furrowed as he tries to follow the movements.</p>
<p>"I don't think I'm cut out for dancing."</p>
<p>"You dance very well, beloved." Ra's replies, only a hint of a smirk in his voice. "Consider the ballroom another battlefield as you do our bed, and I assure you that you will be dancing beautifully in no time at all."</p>
<p><strong>23. Afterlife<br/></strong>"This isn't how I imagined dying." Tim declares as he stares at the ceiling of their bedroom. Ra's hums, paging through a worn copy of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>. "It's a lot more colorful than I thought it would be."</p>
<p>"If you were dying, beloved, I assure you that I would be behaving with much more urgency. Do I appear urgent, to you?"</p>
<p>"No. You appear like the smug bastard you always appear to be." Tim folds his hands over his stomach. "I keep expecting Batman to burst in through the window and rip my head off my shoulders while screaming something about the mission or whatever."</p>
<p>"That would be the high fever."</p>
<p>"I'm going to die."</p>
<p>"I never realized how dramatic you are."</p>
<p>"I think it's the fever." Tim concedes. "Your skin is purple. Why is it purple? Oh, right. <em>Fever</em>. You put me on the good drugs, didn't you?"</p>
<p><strong>24. Hidden<br/></strong>Without fail, Ra's always finds the hidden latches on Tim's costume. Someday, Tim is going to figure out how he keeps finding the damn things and why he doesn't get electrocuted to hell.</p>
<p>Clearly, today isn't that day.</p>
<p>"Hate you." Tim huffs as Ra's lips ghost over his own.</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p><strong>25. Parade<br/></strong>Tim folds his arms over his chest, sheets pooling around his hips as he glares at Ra's, the clothes he's holding in his hand, and the guards at the door.</p>
<p>"I didn't <em>come here</em> to be shown off as your pet."</p>
<p>Ra's raises an elegant eyebrow as if to say, <em>your point?</em></p>
<p>"I have clothes."</p>
<p>"That were lost in the process of you dodging assassins and fleeing your burning hotel room. In the mean time – " Ra's gestures towards the silks and gold and jewels and -</p>
<p>"Is there <em>anything</em> that wouldn't make me look like Princess Leia?"</p>
<p>"Princess Leia?" Ra's frowns, tilts his head. "Who is Princess Leia? I am not familiar with her, which royal family is she from?"</p>
<p>Tim stares, keenly aware of how his jaw has dropped and the way the guards are attempting not to do the same. He shuts his jaw with a small click, narrows his eyes.</p>
<p>"I'll wear the clothes." Tim holds up a finger when Ra's tries to respond, "But later this week, you are clearing your schedule and I'm commandeering a very large television. Then you are going to sit down, shut up, and become indoctrinated to the cult of Star Wars."</p>
<p><strong>26. Touch<br/></strong>He hisses, the hand resting on his arm retreating at the sound. Tim clenches his eyes shut, the light – although it must be distant – hurts. The sensation of the cloth – whatever he's lying on – hurts his skin. Everything hurts.</p>
<p>The voice, Ra's voice, is low and Tim is certain he's trying to be soothing – but it booms in his ears, sending sharp spikes of pain through his head. Ra's barks at someone to shut the door, to turn the lights off, Tim whimpers at the volume. His own voice makes his head ache.</p>
<p>Ra's makes a soft sound of apology, but the lights turn off and he doesn't speak again. Nor does he try to touch Tim's skin.</p>
<p>For that Tim is thankful.</p>
<p><strong>27. Free<br/></strong>"You are free to do as you wish, of course." Ra's begins, slowly, as he surveys the room. "Although I must question your taste."</p>
<p>Timothy gives him a flat look before he resumes putting up framed posters of – various things.</p>
<p>"I must ask if you do recall where you are." Ra's continues as Tim puts up a particularly large image of Superman, next to a picture of Superboy and Kid Flash. Ra's eyes travel over the various posters and pictures, mostly merchandise that his beloved had bought – using <em>Ra's resources</em> – and framed. There is even one that looks like a decent replication of his beloved from his days as Robin.</p>
<p>"Yes. As if the ninja checking in every hour and helping me make sure these things aren't crooked weren't a good enough reminder." Tim stands back, hands on his hips, tilting his head. "Speaking of, does the Superman poster look off center to you?"</p>
<p><strong>28. Enjoy<br/></strong>"You enjoy this." Ra's blinks as Timothy curls into his side, laptop on his lap and online shopping cart gradually filling with merchandise. "That color would not suit you."</p>
<p>Timothy hums, deletes the item in question from his cart, "You're right, I should get it in a different shade of purple. And yes. I do vastly enjoy the irony of me buying merchandise of my friends and colleagues using your money to decorate your home with."</p>
<p>"Why," Ra's continues, as Timothy bites his lip and types in his credit card (<em>Ra's credit card</em>) information. "Do you need five hundred medium sized, two-hundred large, one hundred and fifty-four extra large, five hundred and fifteen small, and one hundred extra small, men sizes Batman shirts?"</p>
<p>"Because." Tim replies, making a pleased sound when a confirmation page turns up in one of Ra's email accounts, "It will match the four hundred and sixty five medium, five hundred and fifty seven large, one hundred and seventeen extra large, three hundred small, and one hundred and seven extra small, men sizes Superman shirts. I should probably mention that I am outfitting your ninja for the most epic of ninja training wars <em>ever</em>."</p>
<p>"Only two sides?"</p>
<p>"I haven't found an Aquaman shirt pattern I like yet. And I can't decide on which Robin shirt to use. Don't worry, I've got it all figured out. You can start taking bets now, if you'd like. Talia places three grand on Robin winning after all the groups except Batgirl and Robin are eliminated. Personally, I'm placing it all on Batwoman, just because."</p>
<p><strong>29. Shining<br/></strong>"No one in my family has any taste!" Damian throws up his arms as Tim casually tosses the latest in a series of love letters off to the side to get burned. Tim rolls his eyes.</p>
<p>"Excuse you, you wouldn't have been <em>born</em> if no one in your family had any taste." Damian waves his hand.</p>
<p>"Not <em>that</em> side of the family. I meant <em>this</em> side of the family. Honestly? <em>You choose my grandfather as your intended</em>?"</p>
<p>"I didn't <em>choose</em> him. He chose me and – <em>ugh</em>. I'm not going to talk about this with you. It's none of your business!"</p>
<p>"It becomes my business if I have to start calling you <em>my grandmother!</em>"</p>
<p>Both of them cringe at the thought.</p>
<p>"Drake, in both our interests, I call a truce towards our animosity in favor of working together to divert my grandfather's attentions." Tim considers Damian's outstretched hand before taking it, solemnly shaking it.</p>
<p>"Deal."</p>
<p><strong>30. Overflow<br/></strong>"This is the world's smallest violin playing for your hearing pleasure." Tim holds his fingers together, not looking as Ra's glares holes in the back of his head. "Besides, it wasn't like <em>you</em> were doing anything with the money."</p>
<p>"Surely you have better things to do than toss my wealth around for sheer amusement."</p>
<p>"It's not for <em>sheer</em> amusement." Tim rolls his eyes. "It's investing in WE stock and assisting with various WE projects. I <em>am</em> majority share holder, at the moment. Of course I would do whatever I could to make sure my investment is safe."</p>
<p>"You are putting funds into the area of production that's…off the table."</p>
<p>"I'm also Batman's son, so – really. <em>Really</em>. You're <em>surprised</em> by this?" Tim turns, shoots Ra's an incredulous look. "I blew up three of your bases in the past twenty hours, started a civil-rights movement among your ninja, had them form a union, hid your sword, ran away to hide in a random city and hotel, and you're <em>surprised</em> by this?"</p>
<p>The man sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose. Tim inwardly preens. He <em>earned</em> that nose-pinch. It's like some sort of trophy, a game, to see how many times he can get that particular reaction in a week without the consequences of what follows.</p>
<p>"You are…an anomaly, beloved."</p>
<p>"An anomaly who's dragged you out of an endless slew of meetings and plotting and scheming to the most romantic city on earth in a very luxurious hotel."</p>
<p>Ra's shoots him a dry look.</p>
<p>"We are currently on a cruise ship off the coast of Mexico, this room is smaller than your closet in my estates."</p>
<p>"Well." Tim folds his arms, "It's always the thought that counts."</p>

  <p>-</p><p><strong>001. Tired<br/></strong>Someday, Tim thinks, when he is brave enough, when it doesn't matter anymore – he will stand. He will stand, shadows dragging out long behind him, and take his place next to Ra's.</p><p>Not now, not tomorrow, but perhaps the day after that. Or the day after that – and he will look Ra's in the eye.</p><p>He will say <em>yes</em>.</p><p><strong>002. Back Alley<br/></strong>He finds the Detective, eyes glimmering and peering out at him with surprise, on accident. His driver is going through the crowded streets of a city he doesn't care enough to name, remember – and in the stall of traffic and pedestrians he turns his head. And there he is -</p><p>Trapped between another's body and a grime-covered wall, mouth painted – smeared – pink-red, long neck exposed to someone else's mouth -</p><p>"Stop the car."</p><p>And Ra's hand on his wrist, as he slides his blade through the stranger's ribs.</p><p><strong>003. Sunrise<br/></strong>The morning light stains their skin gold and blazing blood orange. Their shadows are almost purple, iodine, and the white sheets that fail to cover them turn cream. Tim sighs, a soft gust of air against Ra's collarbone, eyes fluttering – threatening wakefulness – before he sleeps back into dreams of nothing.</p><p>Ra's hand curls over Timothy's hip, possessive – even in sleep, and sinks back into the darkness of the sandman's eyes.</p><p><strong>004. Late<br/></strong>"Don't even bother to look surprised." Tim narrows his eyes at Ra's, sliding into the seat across from him – eyeing the order Ra's has already placed for him. "Is it poisoned?"</p><p>Ra's looks offended.</p><p>"It's a <em>valid question</em>." Tim defends before taking a tentative sip of the wine. "I mean. You did drug me just this <em>morning</em>."</p><p>"So you could get more rest."</p><p>"And thus be <em>late</em> for our own anniversary. Tell me – did you drug me because I needed the rest or because you needed the time to pull something together last minute?"</p><p>"Would you take offense if I said both? You did so ruin my earlier plans by being in the wrong hemisphere."</p><p><strong>005. Son<br/></strong>This is certainly not the life Jack Drake would have wanted for him, Tim thinks as Ra's beckons him into the car. This is something right out of an after school special – don't approach the stranger in the suspicious looking vehicle. Don't let him offer you a ride. Don't take the candy in his hand. Don't let him get you alone.</p><p>Tim opens his mouth, eyes sliding closed as Ra's presses their lips together – pleased and demanding.</p><p>Jack Drake didn't want Tim to be Robin, didn't want to Tim to be a Wayne. And he most certainly would <em>not</em> have wanted Tim to be swapping spit with a man centuries older than him, somewhere on the border of Lithuania, while nursing a stab wound in his thigh – given to him by said man centuries older than him.</p><p>But Tim has never been the son anyone wanted, and he has always been the shadow Ra's has coveted, so why start thinking about it now?</p><p><strong>006. Hot<br/></strong>The metal burns hot against his skin, Tim squeezes his eyes shut – and is only a little bit ashamed to say he screams. But to say that he screams is an exaggeration -</p><p>His throat is too raw, too dry, too bloody to scream with. Whatever it is, it comes out as a rough gurgle of sound that makes Tim's airways clog.</p><p>He passes out after that – which is good because he doesn't think he can stand.</p><p>When he wakes up he is dimly aware of the fading pain on the insides of his thighs, fingers twitching to feel – and yes, those are bandages. He tries to lift his head, throat painful – stinging, sharp and sore with every swallow.</p><p>In the darkness of the room, his eyes find Ra's – "How long?" He mouths, too afraid to try his voice. Ra's does not look pitying, or angry, or much of anything. His face is blank and unreadable.</p><p>"Too long." He replies, but he moves from his place at the far side of the room to sit next to Tim on the bed and brush his fingers through Tim's hair. "Sleep, beloved. Sleep and heal. The fires are not yet extinguished."</p><p>Tim lets his eyes slide closed, and dreams of glaciers.</p><p><strong>007. Friend<br/></strong>"They are servants."</p><p>"Not <em>my</em> servants."</p><p>"They are mine, therefore they are yours."</p><p>"I don't think that's how servitude works."</p><p>"It works the way I say it will work."</p><p>"You say that, but that doesn't make your ninja want to throw me onto a plane back to Gotham any less."</p><p><strong>008. Floor<br/></strong>Tim picks his way through their scattered clothing, trying to figure out where his <em>pants</em> are – really, those are the most important things here.</p><p>"You realize that I am awake, Detective." Tim grits his teeth and ducks to look underneath the bed. "And that it would be futile to attempt to run away, now."</p><p>"I'm not running away from <em>you</em>." Tim says, raising his head to give Ra's a glare, "I'm running away from the inevitable morning after conversation. I'm running away from the fact that <em>Bruce</em> is going to ask me where I was and why I didn't check in immediately after my flight landed. I'm running away from the idea that <em>the Batman</em> is going to find out that I've been fucking his enemy."</p><p>"Such crude language." Ra's looks at him disapprovingly, resting against their pillows, looking unfairly <em>regal</em>. "If you are looking for your pants they are in the hallway, where we left them."</p><p>Tim blinks, head turning towards the door, eyes narrowed.</p><p>"We're in a hotel."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"The chances of my pants still being in the hallway after…" Tim counts. "Eight hours is. Slim."</p><p>"Nonexistent."</p><p>"You do this on <em>purpose</em>." Tim stands, throwing himself back onto the bed and burrowing under the sheets. "Cheater."</p><p>"I thought you were running away." Tim gives Ra's a half hearted glare before tucking himself against the man's side.</p><p>"Well – I'm not going to run away without <em>pants</em>. And yours are too big for me."</p><p><strong>009. Cheat<br/></strong>"That's not <em>fair</em>." Tim complains as Ra's hands slide over his skin. "We've been on an airplane for, like, <em>eighteen hours</em>. People who come out of eighteen hour flights aren't supposed to be <em>composed</em> or <em>regal</em> looking. Or – or – attractive."</p><p>"Are you telling me that I should stop?" Ra's hands pause over Tim's belt buckle, lips hovering over Tim's. "I would respect your wishes, if that is so."</p><p>"Don't make me hurt you."</p><p><strong>010. Think<br/></strong>Tim presses his fingers to his temples. "You've brought me a pet…giant tortoise."</p><p>Said giant turtle is slowly making a circuit of Tim's room. Ra's watches its progress with soft fondness while Tim represses the urge to toss <em>himself</em> out of a window.</p><p>"Yes. Does he please you?"</p><p>"He…does something."</p><p><strong>011. Disgust<br/></strong>"You're <em>fucking Ra's al Ghul.</em>"</p><p>"I'm not having sexual relations with Ra's al Ghul." Tim resists the urge to smack Jason upside the head. Dick snorts, choking on soda and leveling Tim with a look of pure betrayal.</p><p>"Tim?"</p><p>"I'm not having sex with anyone!" Tim snaps, glaring at his siblings. Jason and Dick exchange a look.</p><p>"No one? That's kind of sad."</p><p>"<em>Ugh.</em>"</p><p><strong>012. Shelter<br/></strong>The rain pounds down onto the windows, and Tim stares out, miserable in his water-soaked clothes. He sighs, lips tingling with cold, as he retreats into the warm diner. At least he was close to an open store. As he slides into one of the plastic booths, a waitress comes up with a menu, a towel, and an envelope.</p><p>Trust Ra's to have operatives in a <em>diner</em>.</p><p>He opens the envelope, scanning the simple contents of the letter, before sliding it under the menu.</p><p>
  <em>Dinner is on me.</em>
</p><p><strong>013. Borrow<br/></strong>"That is…not yours." Alfred narrows his eyes at his charge, who's staring at him with wide eyes, paused mid-stretch. Master Timothy blinks, nods, the large shirt slipping off one shoulder before he hastily pulls it back up.</p><p>Not fast enough to hide the marks on his skin. Alfred sighs.</p><p>"I should think you have more taste, young sir." Tim flushes red, muttering something or other under his breath as Alfred sorts his things out for the day. "I suppose that upgrades to Manor security are in order."</p><p><strong>014. Chair<br/></strong>It is not a throne – it is a simple wooden chair, just like all the others at the table. Yet, when Tim sits on it he <em>feels</em> like it is. He becomes the center of attention, the focus of power.</p><p>Ra's hand rests on his shoulder, warm and a rare sign of affection (instead of possession).</p><p><strong>015. Alter<br/></strong>"It needs to be tailored more." Ra's decides, arms crossed as he watches the tailors adjusting Tim's clothes. Tim glares at him in the mirror.</p><p>"What it needs," Tim begins, attempting to turn around without pricking himself on a pin, "is to be less…<em>fabulous</em>."</p><p>Ra's raises an eyebrow. "Fabulous."</p><p>"Fabulous. Vegas show girl. Line dancer. <em>Hey there, gurl.</em> I don't know how you want to phrase it. But that's what it needs <em>not </em>to be."</p><p><strong>016. Peace<br/></strong>Moonlight plays off of the metal of their weapons. Sweat shines on their skin -</p><p>The older of the pair presses his advantage – experience, knowledge, sheer <em>power</em> – while the smaller attempts to evade – speed and youth. The metal blade presses against the younger's skin, "If this had been a real fight, beloved, this would be the end."</p><p>A flash of teeth, a soft intake of breath, a shaky release.</p><p>"Ah, but if it was a real fight you wouldn't be so distracted." The other replies, playful as his fingers release his staff, the metal clattering to the ground as his hands find new purchase on the elder man's shoulders. The elder laughs, deep and pleased as he lowers his own weapon, winds an arm around the slighter man's waist.</p><p>"Oh, but I would, beloved. You are temptation regardless of the situation."</p><p><strong>017. Beach<br/></strong>Tim coughs, the wet weight of his armor dragging him down as he attempts to heave himself onto the beach. He grimaces – Gotham's beaches aren't exactly <em>sanitary</em>. Broken beer bottles glisten in the sand and Tim can practically <em>feel</em> the toxic waste clinging the skin left exposed by the cowl -</p><p>He shudders to think about the bacteria that have just washed into his open wounds.</p><p>The next time Ra's challenges him to an impromptu spar-duel, he's making sure that they move it <em>away</em> from the toxic dump that is Gotham's shoreline.</p><p><strong>018. True<br/></strong>"Did you know," Tim hums into Ra's skin, fingers idly pressing against the elder's skin – tracing nonsense patterns and tapping silly codes – "That when I was little, I went to the circus."</p><p>He feels Ra's fingers, palm, drifting over his side, cup his hip and squeeze. A responding <em>hmmm</em> that Tim can feel with his lips.</p><p>"And that I saw acrobats." Ra's hand slides lower, curving around the underside of his thigh, pulling him close. "And I said I wanted to be one."</p><p>"No, I did not know." Tim opens an eye, lazy and satisfied as Ra's pulls him over his lap, arranges his legs on either side of the man's hips.</p><p>"My mother said I could do it if I wanted to, my father said I wouldn't be flexible enough." Tim nips at Ra's collar bone, feels the other's laugh.</p><p>"And he would be so very wrong about that. You have a very <em>supple</em> body, beloved."</p><p><strong>019. Crazy<br/></strong>Tim snorts, "Oh my god, you gave me the <em>really good stuff</em>." He bursts into giggles, curling up into a ball and tipping onto his side, tries to muffle his laughter into a pillow.</p><p>Ra's hand rubs over his back. "Only the best for my intended."</p><p>"I'm <em>high</em>."</p><p>"I believe the correct response would be – <em>as a kite</em>."</p><p>Tim catches Ra's hand, nuzzles into it, sighs, "I love you, giant blank check."</p><p><strong>020. Love<br/></strong>It is a form of love itself when Ra's stands over Timothy, and does not attempt to stop the bleeding.</p><p>The detective's hands feebly grasp at his cloak, blood soaking the heavy fabric as the pool grows wider. Ra's does not kneel next to him, or attempt to speak to him. Just watches, lets the green turn red-brown.</p><p>When the other is dead, he walks away, unfastening his cloak, allows the man who grasped it in the end to have it. He draws his sword.</p><p>"Master?" The White Ghost looks between Ra's and Timothy, concern and confusion in his voice. Ra's does not look back.</p><p>"Do we still have the signal on the one who did this?"</p><p>"Yes sir."</p><p>"Prepare the car, leave the Detective here. I am certain that his brood will find him."</p><p>"You do not want to take him with us?"</p><p>"Do you question the Demon's Head?"</p><p>"No, sir."</p><p>Ra's does not look back, Timothy would not have wanted him to. There are no words left to say, to exchange, between them.</p><p>That is the life, the love, of a ruler and his chosen intended.</p><p><strong>021. New<br/></strong>"If a new, shinier version of me comes along, what happens?"</p><p>"You are not manufactured."</p><p>"In a hypothetical situation, in which I am an android and a new android that's better than me comes out, what do you do?"</p><p>"Is there something you are trying to tell me?"</p><p>"In a <em>hypothetical situation</em> – "</p><p>"Beloved." Ra's tips Timothy's chin up, thumb tracing his lower lip, withdrawing before the man can bite – "I assure you that the likelihood of finding someone superior than you is very slim. And should it ever happen I believe that your own jealousy would drive you to greater heights. There is, quite literally, no one like you in the world. I would know. Considering that no one else has ever cost me so much in bases and building repair than you."</p><p><strong>022. Beggar<br/></strong>Ra's drops a golden coin into the velvet lined violin case, "You play beautifully."</p><p>Blue eyes roll, "I'm on a case." A boot kicks back, hitting the briefcase underneath the bench. "Quite literally, on a case. Go away and I'll play with you later."</p><p>"I am simply showing a token of my appreciation towards your talents."</p><p>"I'll show <em>you</em> a token of <em>my</em> appreciation when you <em>go away</em>. You're drawing a crowd with your masculine <em>everything</em>. Go, before your sheer levels of testosterone create waves of worshipping admirers."</p><p>"I do not know if I am pleased that your verbal skills have not declined without stimulation or annoyed at their target."</p><p>"Let me know when you decide, <em>elsewhere</em>."</p><p><strong>023. False<br/></strong>"To blow up your bases, or to <em>not</em> blow up your bases," Tim flops down onto the large sofa in front of the fire place in Ra's office, "That is never a question."</p><p>The sound of writing does not pause, though he does hear a purposefully louder exhale.</p><p>"I love you." Tim cuddles into one of the plush pillows, "And don't even bother trying to mask your look of exasperated fondness with irritation. This is how we flirt and you totally accept and encourage it. Why else would you purposefully organize your marine fleet into a heart shape? I got pictures of that, by the way. You <em>romantic</em>, you."</p><p>"Beloved."</p><p>"Yes?"</p><p>"I am in the middle of a meeting."</p><p>"There's no one in this room but us."</p><p>"On speaker phone."</p><p>"Well." Tim yawns, "That's what you get for not putting stronger locks on the door."</p><p><strong>024. Happy<br/></strong>"You are unusually…perky." Ra's observes as the Detective flicks through his library. "May I inquire as to the reason for this?"</p><p>"Drugs." The Detective replies. "No, you don't want to inquire further."</p><p>Ra's opens his mouth to do just that when the Detective throws an encyclopedia at his head.</p><p>"I'm riding out the effects of Joker Gas and our antidote didn't <em>quite</em> eliminate the <em>euphoria</em> part, just the hysterical laughing, crazy smiling part. So. Drugs."</p><p><strong>025. Cancer<br/></strong>Tim nibbles on the crab claw, the soft bone inside it crunching beneath his teeth, sweet-salty meat and juice sliding across his tongue.</p><p>"I feel like this is a date."</p><p>Ra's gives him a bland look. "We are married. We are having dinner in our home."</p><p>"I repeat, I feel like this is a date. The romance in our relationship is dead."</p><p>"I was not aware that there <em>was</em> romance in our relationship."</p><p>"Dead, rotting, six feet under," Tim laments.</p><p><strong>026. Pickpocket<br/></strong>Ra's gives Tim a pointed look as the younger man slides his fingers into Ra's front pocket. "Is there something you wanted?"</p><p>Tim hums, checks Ra's other pocket. "Keys."</p><p>"To?"</p><p>"Something interesting." Tim slides around to his front, fingers slipping into his back pockets, presses a quick kiss to Ra's cheek as the man settles his arms around Timothy's form.</p><p>"You will have to be much more specific than that, beloved."</p><p>"The keys to the castle?"</p><p>"As I said, you would have to be more specific. There <em>are</em> so many, after all."</p><p><strong>027. Reverse<br/></strong>Tim perches on Ra's back, mildly amused by this turn of events. "You know what, I think I like this. It's kind of funny."</p><p>"<em>Beloved</em>." The man – <em>teenager</em> snarls.</p><p>"I've got to thank whoever did this to you. How long did they say it would last? A day? Two days?"</p><p>Tim's only warning is a growled curse in Arabic before their positions are reversed, Ra's body pressed against his from behind.</p><p>"Beloved," Ra's bites the back of Tim's neck, "I assure you that despite my current condition, I am still quite capable of putting you in your place. Do attempt to reign in your amusement at my expense."</p><p>"Why? I never had to baby your ego before." Tim tries to get up, is stopped by Ra's hands pinning his wrists. "Don't tell me that the de-aging has made you <em>sensitive</em>."</p><p>"No." The temporary-teenaged Demon's Head replies, Tim can <em>feel</em> the other's smirk – "But it has made me…<em>other</em> things."</p><p>Tim feels his stomach clench when the other rolls his hips against Tim's ass.</p><p>"If you're blaming that spell on making you horny, I'm calling on that bullshit because you're <em>always</em> horny."</p><p>"Is that a no?"</p><p><strong>028. Deliver<br/></strong>It hurts to breathe, but that's nothing new. Tim considers cauterizing the wound on his side with one of the special heat discs he has, but decides against it.</p><p>He doesn't think he'd be able to stay conscious for very long after wards. Tim presses his hand against his side, cursing himself when he almost falls. His legs are going numb.</p><p>A lot of things are going numb – but he's almost there. Tim pushes his shoulder against the door, groaning when it just <em>barely</em> opens. His legs give out, and he braces for impact against the floor -</p><p>"What has happened?" Ra's catches him, Tim lets out a sigh of relief, wincing when Ra's sweeps him up and carries him into his study. "Detective? Do not go to sleep."</p><p>"I won't. Agh. Assassins, of course." Tim grimaces, turns his head to the side and spits, well, there goes <em>that</em> carpet. "Don't worry, they're not dead. Well. They'll be dead if they don't get medical treatment, but I do know how you like to play with your food before you ultimately put it out of its misery. Does this count as a birthday present?"</p><p><strong>029. Arrival<br/></strong>When Tim first becomes a permanent fixture in the al Ghul household, the servants take one of either two approaches towards him. One, respect and polite interest. Or two, extreme skepticism and suspicion.</p><p>To Ra's credit – there aren't any assassination attempts.</p><p>To Tim's credit – he puts most of the assassination attempts down before Ra's could ever find out about them.</p><p><strong>030. Fall<br/></strong>The room smells like autumn – cinnamon and apples, red and golden spicy-sweetness that tickles his nose and makes his mouth water. Tim turns around in a small circle, throws the windows open and takes in the view of the ocean and beach.</p><p>"Is it to your liking?"</p><p>"It's no Gotham." Tim leans into Ra's touch as the other brushes his fingers over Tim's cheek. "But yes, it's nice here. Calm. Soothing."</p><p>Ra's studies Tim long and hard before sighing, resigned. "You are going to cause trouble."</p><p>Tim smiles, wicked and mischievous, "You always think the worst of me."</p><p>"No, I do not know what to think of you, beloved. Because when I think one thing you seem to become dead set on becoming the other."</p>

Tim closes the book, gently and putting it back on the shelf. "You will bow, submit, cave, and crumble to <em>my</em> whims. Don't even pretend otherwise."</p><p>"You, beloved, are not <em>others</em>." Ra's waves a dismissive hand, Tim cocks his hip, eyebrows raising.</p><p>"And what am I?"</p><p>"You are, as you always have been, <em>yourself</em>."</p><p>"A class all onto my own?

You do not even have <em>shoes</em>."</p><p>"You <em>took</em> my shoes." Tim winces at the pins-and-needles feeling as he slowly starts to regain feeling in his arms. Nerve strikes are all fine and dandy when he's the one giving them, <em>getting</em> them on the other hand –</p><p>"I do not understand what leaves you malcontent." Ra's turns to look around the room that serves as Tim's cage. "You have my wealth at your disposal, a vast and almost infinite amount of finery. You have my resources and my <em>armies, </em>if you would simply acknowledge your role – "</p><p>"I would much rather be Icarus falling than Persephone rising."</p><p>"Icarus, who burned through arrogance?"</p><p>"Icarus, who burned to be free."</p><p>"His freedom cost him, dearly."</p><p>"And Persephone fares better in her gilded cage?"</p><p>"Did Persephone become caged, or did she simply find her own place in the world?" Ra's tilts his head, "For without winter there is no true spring, no waters to flood and irrigate the lands, and there is no appreciation for the bounty of harvest.

Tim lets his eyes fall closed, again. "If I turn to look at you, will you disappear?"</p><p>Tim listens for the rustle of cloth, the whisper of Ra's tread, feels the dip of the mattress, moves – eyes still closed – upright, moving into Ra's space, close enough he can smell the remains of the day -</p><p>He opens his eyes, stares into the gold on green brocade of Ra's cloak, fingers brushing the cloak open to reveal the white dress shirt underneath. Hums, even as Ra's hand settles on the bed by his hip.</p><p>"You're still here."</p><p>Ra's cheek rests against the top of Tim's head, "You have yet to run screaming."</p><p>"So I prefer the monsters over the gods, blame Gotham."</p><p>-</p><p>Tim frowns at the mirror, and – his body just wasn't meant for dancing.

"You are trying too hard."</p><p>"I don't think I was meant to dance." Tim says, eyes half-lidded and bored as Ra's comes forward, close enough to <em>feel</em> without touching.</p><p>"You dance beautifully."</p><p>"Fighting doesn't count as a dance." Tim is perfectly adequate at being lethal, looking hypnotizing and beautiful, on the other hand – is something far, far beyond him.</p><p>"I was not referring to your martial prowess." Ra's hands lightly rest over Tim's hips, fingers pressing into skin and muscle before releasing. Tim narrows his eyes at their reflections, aware of the bright red flush creeping over his neck and shoulders.</p><p>"Sex doesn't count, either." Ra's leans forward, breath intensifying the heat on Tim's skin. Tim finds himself arching into it – his own breath escaping in a <em>sigh</em>, fingers curling around the wooden bar that runs across the wall – Ra's teeth press against his skin. Tim's reflection is red and pink, and absolutely <em>dwarfed</em> by Ra's hands and shoulders and – He reaches back, hand curving around the back of Ra's neck, fingers running through the hair at the nape.</p><p>"Doesn't it?" Ra's replies, casual and innocuous, "You do have such wonderful rhythm."</p><p>Tim tilts his head back and <em>laughs</em>.</p><p> </p><p></p><blockquote>

</blockquote><p>"Ra's, it's disturbing enough to have you as a lover." Tim slowly raises an eyebrow – can't actually wrap his mind around the words <em>lover</em> and <em>Ra's</em> in the same sentence, ignores the internal break in sanity at such an event occurring –, "Please, don't add to that by trying to be my father, too."</p><p>Tim sighs through his nose, cuts off what is no doubt a highly disturbing and well thought out reply -</p><p>"I'm not looking for a disciplinarian, either. Do I <em>look</em> or even <em>act</em> like I need – no. Don't answer that. God, don't answer that."</p><p>"You do have some rather disturbing impulses when enough time is in your hands, beloved one." Ra's pointedly looks at the map on display on the computer monitor.

Better than Jason or Damian's at least. Somewhat better than Steph's. Three out of five Robins, that's not too bad. "In fact, I'd call it a wonderful temperament.

"Okay, in your bed, in your life, willingly. In this base at this given moment in time, unwillingly. I had <em>things</em> I needed to do. Your neediness is startlingly annoying." Tim wrinkles his nose, staring up at the ceiling. Ra's bends over, entering his field of view. "I was counting the tiles on that ceiling."</p><p>"What an idle life you lead." Ra's kneels down, fingers lightly running over Tim's cheek. Tim lets his eyes slip closed. "There are more worth-while pursuits. More entertaining ones, I am sure."</p><p>Tim turns into Ra's hand, soaking in the warmth – "I am in a rebellious stage."</p><p>"I am beginning to think that it is not so much a <em>stage</em> as it is a life-time commitment. What should I do about your family?"</p><p>"Not kill them?"</p><p>"Aside from that. I do realize how displeased you would be, if I were to harm them beyond recovery without your permission."</p><p>"I have trained you well. Good boy." Ra's finger's press against Tim's skin in warning before returning to their passive touch. "I don't know. It's like you think I know how to handle them."</p><p>"You handle me quite fine." Tim's lips twitch up. "Your mind goes to such lewd places, Detective-mine."</p><p>"Not yours." Tim sing-songs. "Besides, <em>you</em> are a rational being. Can you honestly apply <em>rational</em> to any of them?"</p><p>"Reluctantly, Todd. Willingly, Cain."</p><p>"Point. But neither of them are the ones leading the cavalry, now are they?"</p><p> </p>

</p><p>"I think that we're having an extreme misunderstanding." Tim says, "I am not actually his <em>spouse</em>, regardless of whatever pet names he calls me and – you know what. Is that chocolate? Give it here. Just. Just give it here."</p><p>Tim snatches the chocolate out of the – he's not even <em>sure, </em>foreign dignitary? Non-native English speaker who clearly doesn't understand that Ra's calls Tim weirdly affectionate and old-fashioned nicknames more to piss Tim off than out of actual affection? Point though – Ra's sarcasm and flippant teases are somewhat harder to distinguish from his regular mode of speech. Which, when Tim thinks about it, probably explains why they always get weird looks when they go out.</p><p>Go out as in Ra's hauling Tim off for strange events with or without Tim's consent.</p><p>Like that one time at the opera – <em>Tim does not actually enjoy sitting through three plus hours of singing in a foreign language about things he doesn't care about</em>. Really. Especially after being shoved into an annoyingly well-tailored suit. He will never stop being simultaneously flattered and weirded out over Ra's knowing his measurements. Or. Ra's tailor knowing his measurements. Ignoring that Tim knows Ra's measurements. Because. <em>Batman is really, really particular about their simulator's accuracy</em>.</p><p>Tim takes the chocolate – manages to catch only brief snippets of what the person is saying, Tim's not quite fluent in that dialect, but if Ra's has anything to say about it he probably will be soon – and jumps out the window into the courtyard and makes a run for it.</p><p>-</p><p>"Why are your ninja following me?" Tim says, hauling himself in through the window, falling to the floor with a loud <em>thump</em>. Ra's looks up from the book he was reading, sighs, and shakes his head before returning to the book.</p><p>"Why wouldn't my ninja follow you?"</p><p>"Is this because of all those times I blew up your bases?" Tim is actually too tired to get up, so he just rearranges himself on the floor and stares at the ceiling. "Also, what is the point in the ninja following me if they don't actually do anything when I'm in trouble?"</p><p>"You are always in trouble."</p><p>"Yes, but – that's not the point. Your ninja are useless to me. Why don't you have them do something useful? This is a waste of human resources."</p><p>"They are following you to hone their skills, not yours." Ra's says, Tim hears him get up. Tim twists his head, and sees Ra's coming to kneel next to him. "Did you come here dressed in that?"</p><p>"I'm sorry, I was just kind of climbing walls because there are ninja watching me twenty-four seven and I am just about <em>done</em> with it. Excuse me for not hauling ass across the city in something more suitable." Tim rolls his eyes, "Besides, the people at the door wouldn't let me in so I had to break in."</p><p>"Did it ever strike you that they did not let you in because you look homeless?"</p><p>"<em>What the hell is with you ragging on plaid all the time?</em>"</p><p>-</p><p>"So. If I were to tell you that I'm sort of trying to hide from my – something of a romantic partner – how hard will you laugh at me?"</p><p>"Considering that I told you this will happen?" Dick raises an eyebrow as Tim slinks underneath the covers of his bed. "I will laugh very hard then tell you I <em>told you so</em>. Then I'm going to drag you back to the manor and make you tell Bruce about this travesty so <em>he</em> can laugh and tell you – <em>Didn't Dick warn you</em>?"</p><p>Tim curls up, mashing his face into a pillow. "I don't even know why I go to you first."</p><p>"You'd think that you'd take my advice. Considering." Dick waves a hand. "Considering <em>my own experience in this area."</em></p><p>"You didn't <em>date</em> Deathstroke."</p><p>"No, little brother, because I actually do – contrary to popular belief – have a brain that I like to use." Dick sits down, pets what he thinks might be Tim's head, or maybe his shoulder, "So, what's your crazy, murderous, older man-friend doing to drive you crazy this time?"</p><p>"He sent me <em>flowers</em>, Dick. Flowers. As in – honest to god, legitimate flowers."</p><p>Dick raises an eyebrow, Tim tosses the covers back, glaring at the ceiling.</p><p>"And the problem is?"</p><p>"The problem is that they're all over my <em>house</em> and I think they're <em>multiplying</em> whenever I turn my back there are more of them and <em>they are not dying, Dick</em>." Tim's eyes widen as he turns to his brother, "I think ninja are replacing them before they can die and I think Ra's is trying to turn my house into a literal garden of Eden and <em>I think he wants me to be his Adam</em>."</p><p>Dick's other eyebrow raises with the first.</p><p>"Well."</p><p>"What do I do?"</p><p>"Make a business deal with Dinah. And see if Ra's takes requests."</p><p>-</p><p>"When I said that I wished I had a pet cat, this isn't what I meant." Tim resists the urge to hide behind Ra's and – and if anyone asks, he's just. Lingering in the doorway. Ra's turns, slightly, eyebrow raised. Tim resists the urge to defensively raise one back. "Ra's, that belongs in the wilderness of Russia or something. Not <em>here</em>."</p><p>"I think she would match your temperament."</p><p>"I think <em>she</em> should go back to her mother."</p><p>Ignoring the fact that the tiger cub is a beautiful, beautiful girl that Tim thinks would be the star of dozens upon dozens of nature documentaries -</p><p>"Do I look like I'm equipped or trained to deal with a baby tiger?" Hell, sometimes Tim thinks his plants think he's an absent minded dictator. "Ra's, this is a horrible, horrible idea. The thought is appreciated. The implementation of your intentions is not."</p><p>"You are being ridiculous." Ra's steps forward, moving towards the center of the room where the baby tiger is wobbling around the carpet. "Come."</p><p>Tim isn't sure if Ra's means the tiger or <em>him</em>, but either way, he ends up crouching in front of the tiger cub, fingers gently running over the baby's back.</p>

</p><p>"Well, I happen to think that I'm incredibly charming." Tim huffs, throwing his legs out over Ra's. "I don't think your henchmen agree. The ninja <em>love me, </em>though. Which. Great. Though I still can't tell them apart. Which makes me feel like a horrible human being."</p><p>"I fail to understand how you keep finding me."</p><p>"Please. Your ninjas send me a news letter." Tim rolls his eyes, starts texting Dick on his phone. "It's like they think I make you behave. Really." Tim shoots Ra's a look, "Look what I have to work with. And there's this thing about old dogs not being able to learn new tricks."</p><p>"You are slowly driving me to a breaking point." Ra's says, "Also, thank you for not announcing your presence in your usual dramatic manner." Ra's tone tells Tim everything he needs to know about the man's opinion on said entrances.</p><p>"I learned from the best." Tim points out. "You can hardly fault me for my appropriate use of flair when I've grown up around a man who goes around in a cape, another man who thought traffic light colors were the best for a costume, and <em>you</em>."</p><p>"You are not actually blaming <em>me</em> for your destructive dramatics."</p><p>"Oh, but I <em>am</em>. And watch me succeed."</p><p>"Always."</p><p>-</p><p>Tim blames that he didn't notice it sooner on the fact that he has fifteen minutes between classes to decided if he wants a caffeine hit or if he wants choice seating in lecture. On one hand, caffeine and being forced to sit up front in the direct line of sight of the professor. And on the other hand, back-row seats where he can pass out or work on files on his laptop and no caffeine.</p><p>Ah, <em>college</em>.</p><p>So as he's standing in the middle of campus – coffee on one side, class on the other – Tim doesn't think he can be faulted for not realizing that the person standing next to him is one of Ra's operatives until he has a thermos of coffee in one hand and being gently herded towards class by a sudden burst of people.</p><p>Tim blinks as he somehow finds himself sitting in the back row of the lecture hall, coffee in one hand, laptop booting up in front of him, and a new email from an unknown sender telling him that <em>dawdling doesn't suit you, Detective</em>.</p><p>"Yeah." Tim says, deleting the email after putting the email in his block program, "Whatever." Tim sips the coffee. "Stupid busy-body ninja."</p><p>Well. At least they're more subtle than Dick.</p><p>-</p><p>Tim blinks, stares at his alarm clock, stares at the amount of texts on his phone – which is still buzzing – then decides. Fuck. This is what college is all about. Sleeping in and skipping class and being a responsible adult who doesn't need a parent to call in to school while you make fake sick sounds and hold your thermometer over a light-bulb.</p><p>He manages to shuffle back under the covers in his blanket cocoon for all of fifteen minutes before the powers that be decide to take matters into their own hands. By which, Tim realizes to mean, Dick's hands.</p><p>Tim feels the mattress jostle and he hears Dick's voice – "Hey, handsome – you sick? You weren't answering your phone and Alfred got worried."</p><p>"Alfred sent you?" Tim says, staring at the ceiling as Dick unravels him from the blankets. "Why did Alfred send you?"</p><p>"Well, you weren't answering your phone. And you have to admit, rooftop is faster than car." Task of uncovering Tim complete, Dick loops his arms around Tim's shoulders and settles in for a cuddle. Which Tim doesn't necessarily mind. College does things to a person.</p><p>It's like going to war, but with – depending on what college you go to – less blood shed.</p><p>"And what have I done to get Alfred on me, this time?" Tim asks, as Dick plucks Tim's phone off the night stand and starts going through texts. At some point, Tim's going to figure out how Dick keeps guessing his passwords.</p><p>"Aside from you not answering your phone?" Dick raises an eyebrow at him, "Well. There's the fact that B's gotten an alarming amount of notifications about assassins coming into the city and going to your university."</p><p>"And he couldn't <em>warn me</em>?" Tim frowns, "Give me a heads up? Wow. Thanks, guys. Billions of technology at our fingertips and you couldn't shoot me a text."</p><p>Dick gives him a <em>look</em>.</p><p>"Billions of technology at <em>your</em> fingertips and <em>you</em> couldn't tell us that Ra's is courting you?"</p><p>If Tim was a little more awake, he'd choke on his own spit. As it is, Tim just gapes.</p><p>"Back to the reason why Alfred sent me over to check on you – did you know the manor has received a mixture of vaguely worded threats and disappointed messages in Bruce's parenting skills, and presents of high quality groceries for Alfred? At least Ra's knows who the real power in the house is."</p><p>"Oh my <em>god</em>." Tim grabs a pillow and tries to smother himself. "My life will never be the same again."</p><p>"Yup. Pretty much. You have an alarming amount of emails from unknown senders, did you know that?"</p><p>-</p><p>"No." Bruce says as Tim tries to catch up to him on patrol. "He's your problem. Not mine."</p><p>"You are active so immature, right now, B. Just so you know." Tim says, rushing to catch up with his mentor. "One of the first things you taught me was to seek help from experts when you're out of your depth. You're an expert in this. I'm looking to you."</p><p>"I wouldn't say expert."</p><p>"You've dealt with Ra's for years!"</p><p>"Not in the manner he seems to want to deal with <em>you</em>."</p><p>"I thought we took an oath to serve and protect."</p><p>"That's the police force."</p><p>"<em>B." </em>Tim doesn't want to say he whines and stamps his foot, but it's a close thing. He's certain that someone is recording this and will probably use it to mock him or Bruce at a later date. "Come on. You can't seriously be leaving me to Ra's on my own?"</p><p>Bruce turns to look at him, face blank.</p><p>"Don't eat anything he offers."</p><p>"This isn't an after school special, and I'm not Persephone about to be dragged down to hell." Except that he kind of <em>is</em>. Dick and Jason are going to have mocking material for <em>years</em>. "Come <em>on</em>, B."</p><p>"Don't go into any unmarked cars."</p><p>"Are you actually kidding me right now – "</p><p>"Don't accept candy from strangers." Bruce's lip twitches upward. Tim gapes at him.</p><p>"<em>B.</em>"</p><p>"Keep a safe-word."</p><p>A pause. Then -</p><p>There are out-right howls of laughter on the coms.</p><p>"I hate you. I hate you all. I will devote myself to taking over the world out of my pain, and I will blame it all on you."</p>

  <p>-</p><p>"Well. <em>I</em> think that he's a good idea."</p><p>"The reason why we never go with your ideas is because the last time we listened to your ideas we almost go <em>shot</em>, Tom. <em>Shot</em>." Tim points out, jabbing his twin's torso where said almost-gun-shot wound happened. "Tom, the last time we decided that – hey, yeah, you've got a good idea going – we were eleven, stalking Batman, and we almost got <em>killed</em>. As in dead, Tom. Killed <em>dead</em>."</p><p>"It's not like all of <em>your</em> ideas are so <em>stellar</em>." Tom snaps back, smacking Tim's hand away. "I mean. Hello, Tim, your last great idea's got us turned into information brokers on <em>several</em> wanted lists.Tim, it speaks volumes about us that we're more comfortable in skin-tight spandex than in blue jeans and body armor."</p><p>"I happen to have it on good authority that we look fantastic in spandex. The exercise and infiltration does wonders for our calves." Tim crosses his arms, "And this isn't – This isn't, <em>oh hey let's go follow Batman and Robin at night</em>. This isn't <em>hey let's go into the ware house for better pictures</em>. This is."</p><p>Tim waves a hand towards the computer screen, wordless sound of frustration and <em>what even</em>.</p><p>Tom makes a face, because. Yes. It does seem a bit ridiculous.</p><p>"He's not that bad."</p><p>"Not that <em>bad</em>." Tim deadpans. "You are aware of the fact that he's pretty much out to decimate the world's population in an attempt to reach isotactic equilibrium? He's basically taking the <em>final solution</em> global, without. The. You know. Racial part. Just. Heartbeats. Heartbeats are pretty much the requirement. If you live, you die. Basically. He's crazy."</p><p>"Well, when you put it like <em>that</em>." Tom bites his cheek, because his twin has that <em>look</em> in his eyes.</p><p>"I can't believe you got pissed at me for considering working with Deathstroke – <em>who has some valid points about teenagers in tights, in that they shouldn't be</em> – and now you're suggesting it on. Like. This is ten thousand times worse."</p><p>"Probably." Tom admits, reaching out to grasp Tim's hands in his own. "But. <em>But</em>."</p><p>"Oh, this is going to be good." Tim mutters.</p><p>"<em>But</em>. Think about the network access we'll get, Tim. And think about all the things we'll learn. Think about the technology at our fingertips. <em>Tim.</em> He's got the world pretty much in the palm of his hands."</p><p>"He's <em>crazy</em>."</p><p>"Crazy <em>rich</em>. Crazy <em>smart</em>. Crazy <em>loaded</em>."</p><p>Tom looks into Tim's eyes and sees the gears slowly moving. Or more exactly, the numbers calculating. Tim's eyes narrow, and Tom knows he's made his point.</p><p>The money to be made here greatly outweighs the crazy.</p><p>"How old is he supposed to look?"</p><p>"In his words – according to our ever present spy-cams –<em>,"</em> Tom pitches his voice lower, "a <em>vigorous fifty</em>."</p><p>Tim breathes out, once, eyes closing, before they open. Plans arranging and data gathering.</p><p>"Is this before or after the pit? Because. I'm going to admit, a vigorous fifty sort of translates to a <em>virile</em> – "</p><p>"Twenty-five?" Tom wiggles his eyebrows. "I know, right?"</p><p>Tim sighs, squeezes Tom's fingers, and lets his twin smack a kiss against his cheek.</p><p>"When this back-fires on us, and it will, I am going to lord this over you for the remainder of whatever our short and miserable lives amount to. And when mom asks us why we died so young, I'm going to say it was because you couldn't keep it in your pants."</p><p>"Fine, then <em>I'm</em> going to tell mom that at least it wasn't Deathstroke. <em>And</em> that we made money off it."</p><p>"You fucking <em>cheater</em>."</p><p>-</p><p>Tim curls against his twin's side, ducking underneath the covers to hide from the sun. Tom sleepily bats at Tim's head, trying to steal the covers back.</p><p>He blames morning sleepy-ness for not realizing the third member of their little party isn't there. Tim opens his eyes, yawning as he lets Tom get some of the covers back.</p><p>"Where'd he go?" Tim yawns out, pressing his back against Tom's. He feels Tom stretch, flex, then arch to press back against him. Their legs tangle, and Tom reaches back to grope for Tim's hand. Tim curls their fingers together, squeezing once before letting go. "It's too early for him to be gone."</p><p>"He runs nations and empires from the shadows," Tom yawns back, a sharp tugging almost yanking all the covers out of Tim's grasp. "I bet he only power naps."</p><p>Tim snickers. "The Demon's Head <em>power napping</em>."</p><p>"Catching a mid-day snooze." Tom's shaking with suppressed laughter.</p><p>"A <em>siesta</em>."</p><p>"A cat-nap."</p><p>They turn over at the same time, clinging to each other as they giggle with laughter. The idea of <em>Ra's al Ghul</em> napping. Does he use his cloak as a blanket? Or does he ball it up like a pillow? Does it wrinkle? Can he sleep sitting up or does he slump over?</p><p>-</p><p>"I want to marry this network." Tim says, not even a week into moving into one of Ra's secure compounds. "Did you know he has files on Batman that are slightly more comprehensive than ours? And <em>footage of Jason Todd's recovery</em>. Files on his training. <em>Hypotheses on his resurrection</em>."</p><p>"Really?" Tom says, raising his eyebrow at Tim who looks like he's going to fall over himself with delight. "Did you know he has copies of the <em>Dead Sea scrolls?</em>"</p><p>"Copies?" Tim sounds a little disappointed.</p><p>"The originals are on loan." Ra's says, from the doorway, startling them both. "I would gladly gather them if you would wish to see them, however."</p><p>Someone, Tom thinks as he and Tim share a look, has got to put a <em>bell</em> on him. And that someone better be them.</p><p>"No.That's fine. We're fine. Thank you." Tim says, looking a little dazed and wide eyed. Which. Yes. Tom understands. He probably looks the same, too.</p><p>It is one thing to be having online communications with the leader of an international assassination organization. It is quite another to be in the same room as him – unless this is a doppelganger. Either way, the effect is some what breath taking.</p><p>Tom isn't quite sure if he wants to throw himself out a window and make a run for it, or if he wants to throw himself <em>at</em> the man. The soft twitch of Tim's fingers means that Tim's having the same sort of dilemma.</p><p>Their mother would probably vote for them throwing themselves at him and ripping his throat out to assume power over his empire.</p><p>They like to think that such measures are to be saved for last.</p><p>You know. After the possible seduction and endearment.</p><p>"Are you enjoying your stay, thus far? I trust that the conditions are suitable." Ra's says, entering the room. Tim slowly moves around the edges of the room, Tom mimicking him until they're side by side. Ra's shoots them an amused look. They shoot one back.</p><p>They aren't very good with separation.</p><p>Tim's knuckles brush against his, and Tom doesn't hesitate to link their pinkies and ring fingers.</p><p>"We like it just fine." Tim answers, "I didn't realize how polite ninja could be. Right, Tom?"</p><p>"Right, I was a little worried about mistaking one for the other. Your ninja aren't very talkative."</p><p>"A shame, because we are. It's kind of awkward to talk at someone."</p><p>"But we get pretty good at it."</p><p>"Maybe they'll talk back."</p><p>"Tell us to shut up."</p><p>"Make a contributing remark."</p><p>"We remain ever hopeful."</p><p>"Do you <em>train</em> them to be that quiet?"</p><p>"I think the only time we're that quiet is when we're sleeping."</p><p>"God knows that we aren't even that quiet when we're researching."</p><p>"Well – sometimes we are. Depends on what we're researching."</p><p>"Mom couldn't even get us that quiet."</p><p>"Though to be fair, Mom was rather amused by the bullshit we tend to spout off." Tom leans against Tim's side, "I think she set us loose on people she didn't like as entertainment."</p><p>"I don't think, I <em>know</em>." Tim replies, shifting to accommodate Tom's weight. "I bet <em>you</em> didn't know that Dad encouraged it."</p><p>Tom looks up at Tim, "No."</p><p>Tim smiles. "Yeah. I heard them talking about it when we were on our way home from a charity function, once."</p><p>"Wait – why didn't I hear it – "</p><p>"You were asleep."</p><p>"If I was asleep, why weren't you asleep?"</p><p>"I woke up a bit, but I fell asleep again – "</p><p>Ra's clears his throat. They both turn to look at him.</p><p>"Hi." They chime. Ra's looks a mixture of equal parts fascinated, amused, and – um. Appreciative. Which is a new one, for them. "You should tell us to shut up. Chances are we won't listen to you, but we'd at least remember you're in the room. For a bit."</p><p>"Do you often forget that others are in the room?"</p><p>"Only if they don't give us reason to remember."</p><p>-</p><p>Ra's finds the twins napping on the floor of a hallway, curled up in a patch of sunlight. He sighs, watching them for movement before moving to kneel next to them. Not blocking the sunlight, of course.</p><p>"Detectives."</p><p>Timothy – or at least, he believes it is Timothy. Over the past few weeks, he's grown to realize that Timothy is more likely to be the one wearing warm colors than Thomas. Sometimes. It is not a reliable pattern. – wrinkles his nose, curling deeper into his twin when Ra's reaches out to touch his shoulder. Thomas mumbles, lightly squeezing Tim's fingers before returning to sleep.</p><p>"There are better, and more comfortable places to repose." Ra's says, and is fairly certain they hear him.</p><p>The twins have a startling ability to pretend to be one thing, when they are in fact, another.</p><p>The two remain stubbornly asleep on the floor.</p><p>"I will not carry you <em>both</em>." Ra's says. Thomas' eyes flick behind eyelids before he opens one eye.</p><p>"We like it here. It's warm. And sunny."</p><p>Tim hums in agreement, "You should join us."</p><p>"It's comfortable."</p><p>"Forget your troubles."</p><p>"It's stress free."</p><p>"Relaxing."</p><p>They both reach up to idly beckon him into joining them.</p><p>"Nap time for evil organization leaders."</p><p>Then, for reasons Ra's does not understand, they both start snickering, the dark strands of their inky hair seemingly blending together as their faces turn close to each other. It dies off, soon, both of them relaxing into sleep, once more.</p><p>Ra's sighs, unfastening his cloak and spreading it over them, sitting against the wall. He is not one for such idleness, but he has nothing to lose in watching over their slumber.</p>

"No, Ra's, not even actual REM sleep. How do you keep getting my number?"</p><p>Tim's really going to have to get on that, it's troublesome. He's starting to forget which numbers he's supposed to be losing. Even Bruce has been getting a bit annoyed – not that his patience is the best, but Tim knows it's bad when even Bruce is considering just letting it go.</p><p>"How do you keep finding my shell companies and strange, peculiar, ways to get them destroyed without question? Stop bothering it, or it will get worse."</p><p>"I hate it when you answer my questions with a question." Tim sighs, "Don't tell me what to do. And <em>I know that</em>."</p><p>Tim is willing to bet money that there's going to be a package of scar-cream and wound care at his doorstep tomorrow morning, along with a few-word note that is somehow scolding, affectionate, frustrating, and doting at the same time.</p><p>Ra's reminds Tim of his mother in all sorts of disturbing ways.</p><p>Tim blanches at the thought.</p><p>"A penny for your thoughts?"</p><p>"My thoughts aren't nearly so cheap."</p><p>-</p><p>"Can someone sending you medicine you don't want or need without your consent count as harassment?" Tim says, folding himself into the corner of the sofa Bruce is forced to keep in his office. It apparently makes him more approachable, makes people actually want to come talk to him.</p><p>Tim has never needed such thing.</p><p>Bruce wonders if this is going to be one of those talks that makes him want to lay his head down on the table for a few hours and think about nothingness. Tim has a strange and somewhat frightening ability to make him want to do such things. Bruce is fairly certain that it isn't just him, either. He remembers seeing Dick staring at the wall for an hour after talking with Tim. Or, having Tim talk at him.</p><p>Tim needs a pet. Something that doesn't understand human speech.</p><p>"You know current laws better than I do." It's true. Jason is <em>very</em> up to date on law, law reforms, bills about to be passed, bills being put up to be past, city ordinances, and other such things. By extension, <em>Tim</em> is very up to date because he's the only one who Jason can get to sit still and actually listen. Dick tends to interrupt and distract, Damian refuses to listen, and Cass is more interested in what he <em>isn't</em> saying. "Should I be concerned more than I usually am?"</p><p>Tim ignores him, muttering up at the ceiling, knees drawn up to his chest, arms folded over his knees. Bruce shoots him a look that is summarily, also, ignored.</p><p>The only reason Tim gets away with that type of posture is because he's moved out and Alfred is no longer the one in charge of his clothing. Bruce is almost envious.</p><p>He's had to rescue his sweatpants from the garbage multiple times, and despite having children of his own, been scolded over his posture enough that his attempts at scolding said children are ignored.</p><p>Not that they really need much correction. Except Tim.</p><p>Tim has always had a strange way with contortion that not even Dick can match.</p><p>"I am an eighteen year old male who is healthy with regular, if not excessive, physical check-ups." Tim says, frowning at the ceiling. "I do not need the little blue pill."</p><p>Bruce promptly puts his head in his hand and rearranges his schedule to allow for at least one hour to recover from where this conversation is heading.</p><p>"Who sent you…stimulants?"</p><p>"Ra's."</p><p>Bruce gives up and just puts his head on the desk. Tim continues to muse at the ceiling.</p><p>"I am concerned."</p><p>"Do I look like I need help in that area?"</p><p>"Tim."</p><p>"No, really. I don't know – should I feel insulted or violated right now? Is this code for <em>you should have more sex</em> or <em>you should have sex with me</em> or what?"</p><p>"<em>Tim</em>."</p><p>"Do you think he's been watching me?"</p><p>"Tim, <em>no</em>."</p><p>"I should really do sweeps at least twice a week – what do you think, that should be enough, right? Maybe I should stop using chemical compounds as my passwords."</p><p>"Tim."</p><p>"Should I switch to using Green Day songs? Maybe Linkin Park is a better choice? Lyrics from Enya?"</p><p>"<em>Tim</em>."</p><p>"Hey – do you think Jason could help me rig explosives – "</p><p>"<em>No</em>."</p><p>-</p><p>"You have a very <em>strange</em> affinity for odd situations."</p><p>Tim squints his eyes, wonders if the strange spots dancing in his vision are from a head-injury or magic. Possibly both.</p><p>"Why are you here?"</p><p>"I am rescuing you from being thrown into a volcano as a virgin sacrifice to antiquated gods, Detective. A touch of gratitude would not go unappreciated."</p><p>"Why are there five of you?" Tim squints, "Why am I shirtless? I'm pretty sure I need a safe word."</p><p>"How hard did they <em>hit you</em>?"</p><p>There are sounds of metal and screaming all around them and all Tim can focus on is</p><p>"Can you not stand with the sun making a halo around you like you're Jesus reborn?"</p><p>"I apologize for the sun's angle. Next time – and I am certain there will be a next time – I shall attempt to time it so that the sun is not so high. Does that seem fair to you?"</p><p>"Yes. Yes it does. Wait, why are <em>you</em> shirtless?"</p><p>"Detective."</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>"Be quiet."</p><p>-</p><p>Jason wakes up to a cold body in the bed next to him and he almost wonders if someone put a corpse in while he was sleeping.</p><p>Jason opens an eye and Tim's staring back at him.</p><p>"It's too early for your bullshit." Jason groans, but gets up and glares at the younger man who takes his blankets and rolls up into a burrito. That shit. "It's midnight."</p><p>"It's my birthday." Tim says, still staring at him with wide eyes. "Jason, <em>it's my birthday.</em>"</p><p>Jason stares at him. "Congratulations. Why are you here? Aren't you supposed to be celebrating or sleeping or somewhere <em>not here</em>?"</p><p>"But. But Jason." Tim blinks at him. "It's <em>my birthday</em>."</p><p>"Replacement – fine. Happy birthday, I'm sorry I don't have anything better to say – what do you want from me?"</p><p>"<em>I'm legal</em>." Tim hisses. Jason stares, slowly starts backing away.</p><p>"Okay – look, baby bird. Yeah, we've been getting a long and shit, but I'm not into you like that – "</p><p>Tim punches him in the thigh before Jason can properly dodge.</p><p>"Don't be stupid, Jayce. That's <em>incest</em>." Tim rolls his eyes, "It's <em>Ra's</em>."</p><p>Jason stares. Tim stares back.</p><p>"What about the asshole?"</p><p>"I'm <em>legal</em>." Tim whispers, "He's taking his…fascination to a whole new level." Tim stares at Jason's ceiling. "I woke up at exactly midnight to a ninja entering my window with a briefcase of contracts for…extended living arrangements. And a dowry. He sent Bruce a <em>bride price</em>."</p><p>Jason doesn't know if he's dreaming, having a nightmare, still asleep, or <em>hallucinating</em>.</p><p>"Ra's al Ghul sent Bruce a bride price at midnight of the night you turn twenty-one."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Was it a good one – <em>ow</em>. Stop it." Jason rubs his thigh, and is willing to be there's going to be a wicked looking bruise tomorrow. Or. Later today.</p><p>"Of course I didn't." Tim huffs. "I knocked the ninja out, locked him in my bathroom, destroyed the papers and came here."</p><p>"Why <em>here</em>?"</p><p>"Ra's al Ghul would never look for me here. <em>Obviously</em>." Tim blinks up at Jason, wide-eyed in all the ways that make Jason <em>know</em> that shits going to go down. It's the look that all younger siblings give their older siblings just as the world crashes and burns around them. "And you'd <em>never let him get me, would you?</em>"</p><p>"Fuck." Jason groans, and a look at his laptop tells him that there are radio signals and movements closing on his apartment. "You are the – you better be grateful you fuck."</p><p>Tim blinks up at him before disappearing under the covers, hand darting out to give Jason a thumbs up before disappearing again. Jason gets up and goes to brush his teeth and find his body armor from where he dropped it last night.</p><p>"I am your god, replacement. Christ, protecting your fucking virtue like a fucking guardian angel – I'm too fucking old for this goddamn bullshit."</p>

</p><p>"There are some days when all I can think about is how twisted my life has become and how fucked my brain must be for me to take pleasure in mass destruction. Specific to you. Mass destruction specific to you." Tim perches on the edge of Ra's desk. "I feel like I've been trained. See Ra's property to boom? Smile, get a pet on the head and a cookie."</p><p>Ra's gives him a severely unimpressed look. Tim blinks at him.</p><p>"And how does that make <em>you</em> feel?"</p><p>"Annoyed, at best. Impressed, at worst." Ra's replies, "You are sitting on my paper work."</p><p>"Your paper work is not nearly as interesting as I am. You're the one who kidnapped me – deal with the consequences. Entertain me."</p><p>"You've been able to entertain yourself on your own thus far. Tell me, do you follow your mentor like this as well?"</p><p>"Bruce is entertaining whenever he enters the public eye. Have you seen him whenever someone aims a lens towards him?" Tim snorts, "He's a walking comedy."</p><p>"Watching your mentor interact with the general populace is painful to watch." Ra's replies, hands folding together. Tim takes that as a concession. "Your humor is somewhat painful."</p><p>"I go around throwing out quips and puns and one-liners dressed like someone out of a comic book. You wear a cape and go around like a shadow government, talking like you've walked out of a old novel. You do not have the higher ground to be talking about humor."</p><p>-</p><p>Tim idly picks at the edges of the bandages wrapped around his wrist. Dick shoots him a look. Tim stops, waits for Dick to turn around, then starts picking at it again.</p><p>"Tim."</p><p>"Yes, Dick?"</p><p>"If you don't stop picking at it, I'm going to do something drastic."</p><p>"But it itches."</p><p>"Tim."</p><p>"Yes, Dick?"</p><p>"Don't make me come over there." Tim snorts, slowly lowers his arm. "I swear, you're making me act like a parent. Which is horrible, Tim. I'm not that old."</p><p>"Yes, you are."</p><p>"No, I'm not."</p><p>"In some cultures, you'd be considered too old for marriage." Tim points out, crossing his legs, "Also. I'm making you into a better person by being an annoying little brother. Consider this payback for everything you've ever done."</p><p>"I am not that horrible." Dick snorts, "Besides, if you pick at it, you'll make it worse. So I'm doing this for your own good. Ugh. I sound so responsible. <em>Tim</em>."</p><p>"You are that horrible, Dick. Should we go ask Damian and Dick?"</p><p>"You left out Cass."</p><p>"Cass views you like a cute baby duck. Annoying at times, but overall cute and not much of a threat."</p><p>"I'm not a threat!"</p><p>"To <em>her</em>. She's the favorite. The rest of us are fair game." Tim points out. "Besides she could end you."</p><p>Dick turns and sulks at him. Tim sticks out his tongue. Mature? No. Did Tim ever claim to be? Nope.</p><p>"I am not that bad. Do you see me judging you and being overbearing and frowny in your direction because I disapprove of your boyfriend? No. I do that when you aren't looking. I think you should give me credit for that."</p><p>Tim glares. Dick beams.</p><p>"It doesn't count if you <em>tell</em> me you're doing it behind my back. Besides, I don't have a boyfriend."</p><p>Dick turns around completely, folding his arms over his chest, eyebrow cocked. <em>Really?</em></p><p>"Does he not take you out to dinner?"</p><p>"Yes – but it's not, it's not like. I'm pretty much kidnapped off the street and end up in a fancy place for food."</p><p>"So he surprises you with dinner."</p><p>"Well. That's <em>one</em> word for it."</p><p>"And does he send you gifts?"</p><p>"Yes, but it's not wanted."</p><p>"Do you, or do you not, <em>keep</em> said gifts."</p><p>"Well what am I supposed to do with them after I get them, Dick?"</p><p>"Do you, or do you not, <em>send him thank you emails and cards for said gifts?</em>"</p><p>"It's only polite – "</p><p>"Does he talk to you about your interests and is he sincere about it?"</p><p>"Yes, but that's not the same thing as normal people talking. It's like. Enemy talks on steroids."</p><p>"Does he or does he not take you out to various places like parks, museums, plays, so on and so forth, accompanying you and holding your hand and sometimes resting his hand at the small of your back?"</p><p>"Well – <em>yes, but Dick this is really not the same thing –"</em></p><p><em>"</em>Does he or does he not call you his <em>beloved</em>?"</p><p>Tim glares. Dick preens.</p><p>"You're such an asshole."</p><p>-</p><p>"Of all the people in the world, Drake, <em>of all the people in the world to be attracted to</em>, you had to settle with my Grandfather?" Damian hisses, yanking Tim back into a hidden alcove. Tim glares at the sixteen year old. "You could so so much better."</p><p>"Thank you for saying that, and <em>I did not settle</em>." Tim pries his arm from Damian's grip. The teenager glares at him, frown on his face as he raises his eyebrow. "I didn't!"</p><p>"Do you think I'm stupid?" Damian deadpans. "Everyone knows that he's been sending you…<em>courting</em> gifts. He's made – it's common knowledge, Drake, he's spoken of how much he <em>values</em> you." Damian raises his hands to do air quotes as he says the word <em>values</em>. "Everyone knows the way he looks at you, speaks of you, thinks of you. I didn't realize it was <em>mutual</em>, though<em>. I thought you had taste</em>."</p><p>"It isn't mutual."</p><p>"Then <em>why </em>is he here? At your <em>birthday gala</em>?"</p><p>"One. I don't want you to be here, but you are. Two, <em>I</em> don't want to be here, and yet I am. So. He's not necessarily here because I want him to be."</p><p>Damian waves his hand at where Ra's is.</p><p>Tim grimaces.</p><p>"He's here in person, Drake. In <em>person</em>. Not copy, not doppelanger, not some strange android or fake. In <em>person</em>. You could get him assassinated right <em>here</em>."</p><p>"Maybe he's taunting us?"</p><p>"Or <em>maybe</em> he's trying to court you!" Damian pulls out his cell phone, "I'm calling Father. Obviously Grayson and Todd can't actually be trusted with their duties."</p><p>Tim groans. Damian shoves him further into the alcove.</p><p>"Maybe he won't see me?"</p><p>"Or maybe the world is going to spontaneously explode. Tt. Don't be foolish, Drake. Now <em>hide</em> for the love of – <em>hide</em>."</p><p>-</p><p>"You are in denial and Dick wants me to talk sense into you." Cass says, sitting on Tim's legs before he can properly scramble out of bed. Unfair. He could probably still escape. She'd probably nerve strike him to hell and back, but still. "I don't know why he thinks I'll be able to. But." She shrugs.</p><p>"Is this something I'm going to be traumatized by?" Tim asks, hugging a pillow to his chest, gets ready to smother himself. Cass doesn't stop him, and Tim takes that as an answer on its own. "What did he want you to talk to me about?"</p><p>"Sex." She replies.</p><p>Tim tries to roll over, Cass does not move from sitting on his legs. He stares at the ceiling and tries to control his blush. Tim doesn't blush in public, he doesn't blush as Red Robin, he can blush at will, he can even stop his blushes.</p><p>But something about being around his family shoots all that to hell and suddenly he's a walking, talking, hysterical blush.</p><p>"Specifically, sex with bad men." Cass frowns. "I don't know why he thinks I will be able to help with this. I think he just wants to laugh at the tape of this."</p><p>Tim groans.</p><p>"Dick wants me to tell you that you should realize your feelings. Specifically your feelings of arousal. He also wants you to realize that they aren't bad things – " She doesn't stop him from screaming into a pillow, but she does pause until he's done and then continues. " – just that you should be aware  that he might treat you right. And that it's ok to be attracted to bad boys – "</p><p>Tim chokes.</p><p>" – as long as you realize that it's not always healthy and such urges shouldn't always be acted on. He wants to stress that he isn't trying to shame or suppress you. Just make you aware of your choices."</p><p>"I am <em>not attracted</em> – " Cass just <em>looks at him</em>. Tim can <em>feel</em> it. "Ok. Maybe a little bit. Just a little a bit. Not a significant amount, just a little. Fine. Maybe more than a little. <em>But it's not as much as you think."</em></p><p>

</p><p><em>"</em>I've been named Queen slash King of a small island nation and I don't know how to handle it." Tim says, dropping himself on the kitchen island in front of Alfred. "And since you lived part of your life under a constitutional monarchy, I would like your input on this."</p><p>Alfred raises a slow eyebrow.</p><p>Tim holds up the official documents he got in the mail earlier today. Alfred sighs, leans forward to examine it before returning to cutting up vegetables for dinner.</p><p>"Sir."</p><p>"Yes, Alfred?"</p><p>"Perfect your wave."</p>

</p><p>
  <strong>1. Amuse Me</strong>
</p><p>"You must think yourself so <em>charming</em>, Detective."</p><p>Tim pauses in the middle of moving all of Ra's' things slightly to the left, shrugs his shoulders, and continues. "I must be, because you aren't even angry."</p><p>"<em>Really</em>? I do believe I am feeling quite upset by this intrusion and…odd alterations in my private quarters."</p><p>"Nope. You aren't fooling me. You only call me <em>Detective</em>," Tim drops his voice and forces it into something that sounds highly pretentious<em>, "</em>When you're trying to hide how you <em>really</em> feel. Also that tone of voice you're using? I'm on to you. That's your <em>how have I not killed this person yet, why is my face trying to smile</em> voice."</p><p>"I do not have a voice."</p><p>"You do. You're using it right now. Also, if you think that your books and furniture are the only things I've moved. You are <em>very</em> wrong, and I would step wisely if I were you."</p><p>"Did you move the security measures?"</p><p>"You might want to move a bit to the right."</p><p>
  <strong>2. Break Me</strong>
</p><p>"I want to make this clear – I'm doing this because I want to. Okay?" Tim says, resists the urge to cross his arms or do something that would show weakness or insecurity. Insert saying about predators and smelling fear, here. "It's not because you won, it's not because I lost. It's not because you – it's not because of <em>you</em>."</p><p>Tim forces himself to look into Ra's eyes and hates that there's <em>pity</em> there.</p><p>"Don't look at me like that. <em>Don't</em>." Tim's hands squeeze into fists – "Not you. <em>Not you</em>."</p><p>Ra's looks away, and – and maybe in some other situation Tim would gloat. Not this time. Ra's holds out his hand, and Tim. Tim takes it.</p><p>"The deal is done." Ra's says, and he doesn't even have the decency to pretend to sound happy. Tim's teeth cut into his gums, before he forces his jaw to unclench.</p><p>"It is done. Protect them, like you promised. <em>Protect them</em>."</p><p>
  <strong>3. Call Me</strong>
</p><p>"I want Ra's to be there." Tim says, and Bruce turns to stare at him.</p><p>"Excuse me?"</p><p>"I want Ra's – one of Ra's more competent underlings to be there." Tim repeats, sour twist to his lips. "Ra's' been working in that area of Bolivia for <em>years</em>. He's established. He'd be a better mediator for us and a good advisor, considering we don't know how our influence will effect the area. He also owes me a favor or two."</p><p>"Is there something you've neglected to tell me about your current business deals, Tim?"</p><p>"Only that W.E. expansion into Mexico is going <em>really</em> well."</p><p>
  <strong>4. Drink me</strong>
</p><p>"You are <em>drunk</em>." Ra's sounds surprised. "That was…"</p><p>"Quick? Fast? Easy?" Tim tilts his head, squints. "I want to clarify that while it is easy to get me drunk, I, myself, am not easy."</p><p>"Perish the thought." Ra's tries to take the glass from him, Tim yanks his arm back. "I think you've had enough, Timothy."</p><p>"And I think that I have not had enough. I mean, my words aren't even <em>slurred</em>. Also I only see two of you, so that's not <em>too</em> bad, is it?" Tim wonders how dumb he'd look if he reaches out and grabs the wrong bottle. He's pretty sure that only one of them is real. "I mean, I could be envisioning you naked, or something. I don't know. I don't get drunk often. I'm told I'm affectionate. I don't know. I really don't."</p><p>"Considering that you're currently half-way on top of the table and getting closer to me, yes. You are affectionate. Timothy <em>what</em> are you doing?"</p><p>"What's your skin care regimen?" Tim reaches, frowns when Ra's carefully catches his hand and pushes it away. "You look amazingly young for like, what are you supposed to be this time around? Fifty? Oh, hey – you have <em>really</em> nice eyes for such an asshole."</p><p>
  <strong>5. Enamor Me</strong>
</p><p>"I think we need to set ground rules for…courting." Tim grimaces around the word. <em>Courting</em>. God, it's like he's living in an eighteenth century romance novel. But it's not even dating or stalking. It's legitimate <em>courting</em>. "I mean. I'm flattered. Every kid wants to be the ruler of a small island nation, right? But. Um. It just doesn't look <em>good</em> for Tim Drake-Wayne when he's being pursued by men of your…age."</p><p>Also morality and life-goals. But whatever, the media doesn't know about that bit.</p><p>"Would you rather I do what men of this age do and make incredibly violent and sexually aggressive slurs towards your body?" Ra's deadpans, "Because I will <em>not</em> reduce myself to such crass behavior."</p><p>"Good to know. But…could you just scale it back. A bit. A lot. Flowers are nice. Or so I'm told."</p><p>"You don't actually enjoy flowers." Ra's raises an eyebrow. "Nor do you wear jewelry, and you would not honestly enjoy outings to the opera. And you only eat chocolate when you are on a…<em>binge</em> and then work out obsessively to ease your guilt over said binge. I'd rather not encourage such behaviors."</p><p>
  <strong>6. Fight Me</strong>
</p><p>"This is why I never let you pick our vacation spots." Tim yells out, ducking in time to avoid being hit by a…cultist, he supposes is an adequate word, being thrown through the air. "<em>An active volcano</em>, Ra's. An <em>active volcano</em>. And then I almost get ritually sacrificed. Are you <em>actually kidding me</em>."</p><p>"It was not active <em>before</em>." Ra's replies, expression of uttermost annoyance on his face as he flings cultists left and right. "Also, I would like to point out that this would not be a problem if you were not a <em>virgin and therefor qualified to be a virgin sacrifice to long antiquated gods</em>."</p><p>"Oh, that's right, blame <em>me</em> for this – and for the love of fuck stop throwing them <em>my</em> way."</p><p>"You are standing right next to a lava flow, beloved-one. It's a quick disposal method and <em>if you would get away from the lava flow – </em>"</p><p>"Don't tell me what to do! And get away from there, the ground is unstable."</p><p>
  <strong>7. Get Me</strong>
</p><p>"We are never talking about this again." Tim grits out through his teeth, Ra's makes a noncommittal sound below him. He's goddamn lucky that it was Tim's knee that got busted and not one of his arms. "Ever. I mean it. I'm not saving you because I agree with you or because I…<em>like</em> you. I'm saving you because you're the only one who can beat that <em>thing</em> up there. So you better not do something appropriately villain-ish and stab me when this is over, got it?"</p><p>"I hear you." Ra's answers, "Pull me up."</p><p>"You gonna live?"</p><p>"Just get me up there so I can kill the beast, Timothy."</p><p>
  <strong>8. Haunt Me</strong>
</p><p>"And here I thought you to be dead." He looks over the young man – older now, he supposes. Time is…Time gets away from him, at times. It has been so very, very long. "There is nothing left for you, in this city."</p><p>Perhaps once, there was. When Bruce Wayne and his progeny still lived. Gotham sinks into the Atlantic, sewage and machines and human garbage all heavier than the basalt they lie on.</p><p>Timothy Drake looks at him, and Ra's wonders how he lived. <em>How</em>. It's been at least a century, since he saw the man die.</p><p>He smiles. Ra's finds himself feeling – amusement. Contentment. Odd, he wonders how long it's been since he felt this…playful.</p><p>"Hello, Detective."</p><p>Timothy smiles – cheeky and impertinent, as always.</p><p>"Hi."</p><p>
  <strong>9. Invite Me</strong>
</p><p>"I am not wrong."</p><p>"No, you are not."</p><p>"Then why won't anyone listen to me?"</p><p>"Fortune favors the bold, but convention often crushes the creative."</p><p>"Do you think I'm crazy?"</p><p>"I have thought you strange and ahead of your time. I have often thought of you as curious and innocent. Restrained and sadly closed minded. But no, Timothy. I have never thought you as insane."</p><p>"You helped me once. In a situation like this."</p><p>"That I did."</p><p>"Would you – would you help me again?"</p><p>
  <strong>10. Join Me</strong>
</p><p>"You would declare war on everything you've ever known. Why?"</p><p>"What I know doesn't work. Insanity is said to be doing the same thing over and over again." The man smiles. It is…it is not as satisfactory as Ra's thinks it should be. He has worked – to an extent – to get the man to come to his side, after all. This is a result he's been trying to achieve. Not his main goal, of course, but a sort of…aside. "Maybe this will change something. Who knows? Are you having second thoughts, Ra's?"</p><p>"Not at all. I am simply curious. As I ever am, about you and what goes on behind your eyes."</p><p>
  <strong>11. Kill Me</strong>
</p><p>"I'm not sorry." Tim says, and Ra's – Ra's doesn't say anything. He <em>smiles</em>. "And I know this isn't the end. I know."</p><p>"You are stalling." Ra's replies, Tim forces his eyes not to look at the blood. Ra's hands are tight around his, and. He's going to make Tim hold on until he's dead. He's going to make Tim hold onto this dagger, hold him here. Stay until he's fucking <em>dead </em>and <em>cold</em>. "Do me a kindness and stay for my last moments, Detective."</p><p>"You aren't even asking." Tim closes his eyes. "Rude till the last, I'm almost going to miss you."</p><p>"Don't lie, it's unbecoming. I would think that I earned at least a modicum of honesty."</p><p>
  <strong>12. Love Me</strong>
</p><p>"What are you doing?"</p><p>"Learning to enjoy myself when I'm in such poor company." Tim replies, crossing his legs at the ankle. "Your ceiling mosaic is missing a few tiles."</p><p>Ra's tilts his head back. "Hm."</p><p>"Your ninja don't talk much."</p><p>"They are not kept in my service to speak their minds."</p><p>"I get that. They really only know how to sing your praises. Or. Um. Well. Sing your phrases."</p><p>"Is there a difference?"</p><p>"Not really." Tim reaches out and tugs at Ra's pant leg. "If you're going to pretend to hold me hostage at least entertain me until Bruce comes to pick me up and pretend to be irritated."</p><p>
  <strong>13. Mourn Me</strong>
</p><p>As a general rule, the Demon's Head does <em>not</em> mourn or regret past decisions. Everything is made towards the ultimate goal, everything is a sacrifice. There are choices to be made, and prices to be paid, bargains to be struck, and there will always be losses.</p><p>it's unreasonable to be sad over the passing of someone. Death is part of life, after all.</p><p>And the Demon's Head has embraced it.</p><p>Tim looks out the window, onto Gotham below him. He remembers it. All those years ago, still. It's fresh in his mind. Tim wonders if Damian still remembers it, as well.</p><p>If Damian is angry for not being the one to do it, in the end.</p><p>"You are, as always, a pain in my ass." Tim mutters. "I hope you're watching this from hell, you bastard."</p><p>"Sir?" Tim turns, smiles.</p><p>"Nothing. Is the flight ready?"</p><p>"Yes, my lord."</p>

  <strong>14. Nurse Me</strong>
</p><p>"I'm disappointed in you."</p><p>"Oh fuck you."</p><p>"Language."</p><p>"You're not my parent. You don't get to be my antagonist, parent, <em>and</em> love-interest. That isn't how movies work."</p><p>"I am <em>not</em> your antagonist, for one thing. Nor do you live in a film, so the point is irrelevant. I'm still disappointed in you.

  <strong>15. Offer me</strong>
</p><p>"The life you offer me – the one you think I want. The one you think anyone would want, that you think is the completely logical choice. It's not. You assume I'd want it – you assume that ignoring everything else."</p><p>"Ignoring what?"</p><p>"My friends. My family. Who and what I stand for."</p><p>"But who <em>do</em> you stand for, Detective? Who – when you have been turned away, already?"</p><p>"I stand for myself."</p><p>
  <strong>16. Paint Me</strong>
</p><p>"Is this how you picture me?"</p><p>"It is how you know yourself to be, Timothy. If you would simply remove yourself from the fetters of your imagination and your fears."</p><p>
  <strong>17. Quiet Me</strong>
</p><p>"No." Tim snarls, "<em>No</em>."</p><p>"No." The man – Ra's, it's Ra's, it has to be. Lazarus pit, warm skin, slight accent, physical strength and accuracy to block all of Tim's lethal strikes – agrees, his voice warm against Tim's damp skin. "It is over, Timothy. It is over. You are here. You are alive. You are safe. You are whole, once more. There is none who would harm you."</p><p>No, Tim thinks. Because he'll finish it. He'll finish what was started and end it himself.</p><p>
  <strong>18. Remember Me</strong>
</p><p>"It has been several years since I saw you last." Ra's says, and it is…something of an understatement. But he is quite certain that explaining the exact mechanics behind reincarnation, magic, and extreme dumb <em>luck</em>.</p><p>The Detective seems to have fared slightly better, in this life. Or at least, he isn't subject to serial neglect nor extreme physical abuse via heroic acts.</p><p>The boy looks up at him. And even at this age, in this time, the boy looks at him with suspicion, small nose wrinkled and mouth drawn downwards.</p><p>"Hello."</p><p>"I'm not supposed to talk to strangers."</p><p>"We met a long time ago, we are not strangers. Would you talk to me if I introduced myself again?"</p><p>
  <strong>19. Tell Me</strong>
</p><p>"I never thought it would be you." Tim admits, knees drawn up to his chest. "I did imagine, how I'd be saved. Or. You know. <em>Rot in here forever</em>. Heh. But it's <em>you</em>." Tim laughs, "Why is it always <em>you</em>? Always – always, always <em>you</em>."</p><p>Ra's waits outside the cell. "May I come in?"</p><p>"Sure. Why not?" Tim shrugs, waves Ra's in. "No one can stop you."</p><p>"I would not come where I am not wanted, Timothy. I would think that you have had enough of people going where they are unwanted for a life time."</p><p>"Understatement." Tim picks at his nails. "Ra's, why are you really, really, here?"</p><p>"Because you have been away for quite a long time, Timothy." Ra's steps into the cell,  "And I quite think that you've had enough time in the dark."</p><p>
  <strong>20. Unbind Me</strong>
</p><p>"You couldn't honestly think any jail could hold him." Tim says. "Even if I didn't give him a little help, it only would have been a matter of time. At least this way no one's dead or worse."</p><p>"Is that how you convince yourself that you're doing the right thing - that you've done the right thing, Tim?"</p><p>"No. It's what I remind myself when I think about letting him rot."</p><p>
  <strong>21. Value me</strong>
</p><p>"He's the lesser of two evils, and I think we all know that. We hate it, but we know it. Or do I have to make us all remember Nyssa?" Tim says, and Cassandra puts her head in her hands. Bruce's expression is sour.</p><p>"He's still a criminal."</p><p>"He's the <em>law</em>." Tim breathes out through his nose, "He has almost every major power in his pocket. And who do you think is going to pick up the slack if we get rid of him? That's not even considering the question of the power vacuum he'd leave behind – the internal factions and struggles."</p><p>"Are you defending him, Tim? After what he's done to all of us, to <em>you</em>?" Dick hisses.</p><p>"No. I'm saying that if it isn't him, it's someone else. And I'd rather the evil, manipulative, son of a bitch I know and have established rules of warfare than the one I don't."</p><p>
  <strong>22. Wed Me</strong>
</p><p>"This is entirely too banal, even from someone of your social stature. Really, Timothy, <em>arranged marriage</em>?"</p><p>"Well, it's not <em>my</em> choice."</p><p>"Allow me to liberate you of said unwanted choice."</p><p>"How?"</p><p>"You obviously cannot be married to <em>her</em> if you are already wed to <em>me</em>."</p><p>
  <strong>23. X Me</strong>
</p><p>"Birds." Tim hums, "I like them. I can understand why so many people use them as a motif."</p><p>"And you are telling me this, <em>why</em>, exactly?"</p><p>Tim leans back, tapping his fingers together.</p><p>"I'm currently attempting to think up a new identity, as the one I'm using at the moment has been used to fulfill its purpose and no longer suits me or my goals."</p><p>"Alright."</p><p>Tim looks towards Ra's, "I was thinking of something a little more…down to earth. Something less…visible."</p><p>"Viper-mine, are you looking for flattery?"</p><p>"No. I'm looking for inspiration."</p><p>
  <strong>24. Yahoo Me</strong>
</p><p>"You are alive." Ra's blinks, "I admit to being rather stunned."</p><p>"I'm a lot harder to kill than people seem to think I am." Tim wheezes, staring up at the man. "Are you going to just stare at me, or what? Help me up."</p><p>"You <em>fell</em>. Into a <em>volcano</em>. After you were pushed out of an airplane. With at least two broken bones. Forgive me for doubting even <em>your</em> ability to endure. Should I bring out a white wine, or a red?"</p><p>"How about a medic, first?"</p><p>
  <strong>25. Zip Me</strong>
</p><p>"This is unexpectedly difficult, and I don't understand why I'm doing this." Tim mutters, tracing patterns over Ra's skin. "Don't you have professionals to do this for you, or something?</p><p>"Consider this a form of enrichment, Detective."</p><p>"I don't think I'm ever going to need to know how to do this to save the world." He huffs, lightly placing dots on Ra's wrist. "Also, I should do something outrageous. Like draw a bat. Or a robin."</p><p>"I would wear your insignia proudly, clever-one." Ra's hums, "And of course, it will wash out with time."</p><p> </p>

</p><p>"Anything you can do, I can do better. I can do anything better than <em>you</em>." Drake sing-songs and Ra's is having the serious urge to contemplate his life choices thus far. Which is against his policy of self-doubt.</p><p>"Must you, Detective? What in the world do you need to form your own crime organization for?"</p><p>"Because <em>you</em> have one, and I can do anything better than you and I'm proving it right now."</p><p>"This is petty."</p><p>"You're just mad because I'm doing pretty well at this and your followers are contemplating leaving you to join <em>me</em>." Ra's closes his eyes as the man waves his hand in the air, "Guess you're reconsidering taking their pensions away  now, aren't you?"</p><p>"They don't have pensions."</p><p>"Really? Because I give mine a 401k." Drake smiles, Ra's sighs.</p><p>"Detective, you aren't even a criminal. Why are you doing this?"</p><p>"To piss you off." Drake replies with an annoying amount of aplomb. "To get back at you. To hurt you. To make you feel regret."</p><p>"Whatever for?"</p><p>"For trying to assassinate my family." Drake's eyes snap to that cold, dark place that Ra's has always been so very interested in. An expression he's seen very few times, and far in between. It's rather thrilling to see it once more, even if it is directed at himself.</p><p>"I've done that multiple times before. I hardly think that this latest attempt warrants this kind of reaction."</p><p>"The difference is, that you almost succeeded." Drake steeples his fingers, "And while your half-hearted attempts irritated me, <em>this</em> latest effort of yours has crossed a line. Bruce was recovering from surgery, Damian's been down with pneumonia, Jason's still recovering from fear gas - a strain of which I'm definitely suspecting you of having a hand in - and Dick's been running himself ragged with the Birds trying to keep the city together. And you thought I wouldn't notice all of this happening from California?"</p><p>"In all honesty, I had hoped to finish before you noticed. How is Damian's recovery?"</p><p>"Fine. Despite the fact that you almost cut his throat open." Drake's upper lip curls in distaste, "A favor that I'm sure he'd be happy to return."</p><p>"I don't understand why you're so upset. No one actually died. As they say, no harm, no foul."</p><p>"Have I ever been one to follow aphorisms?"</p><p>"Only when they please you." Ra's admits, sighs, and resigns himself to having to deal with the Detective playing crime-boss for a few years. "You're so very, very annoying to respect some days, Detective. Are you sure there isn't something you could do to make me want to kill you for real?"</p><p>"Well, if you do kill me someday, you'd better make sure it sticks."</p><p><strong>turtlesocks</strong>:</p><p>"I want to make it clear that just because you've," Tim air quotes, "<em>behaved</em> recently doesn't mean I trust you any farther than Alfred can throw you."</p><p>Ra's raises an eyebrow.</p><p>"And as much as I love Alfred, I don't think he can throw anyone very far." Tim continues, "Literally, the only reason you're here is because I firmly believe in using every tool at my disposal to its fullest. And let's face it, you're more trouble than you're worth half the time to keep in my metaphorical tool box."</p><p>"You have such a way with words, has anyone ever told you that?" Ra's replies, flicking invisible lint off Tim's shoulder. "I know how this works, Timothy. Despite what you may think, people were using dating as revenge tactics much longer before you."</p><p>"Okay, so we should establish ground rules. And by <em>we</em> I mean <em>me</em>."</p><p>Ra's hums, "I indulge you far too much, I think."</p><p>"I think that I need a drink." Tim mutters, "And by the end of the night I'll probably have had loads of drinks."</p><p>"Please don't get intoxicated, Detective. You get ever so - <em>open</em> when you're drunk. It's not very appealing." Ra's sighs, "It's almost tempting to exploit, except for how unbecoming it is for you. I'm embarrassed on your behalf."</p><p>"Ground rule number one is no touching." Tim says, waving off Ra's hand when he tries to cup Tim's elbow. "Like, at all. Two is no significant looks."</p><p>"You do make this very hard on me. Isn't this mistreatment?"</p><p>"You can handle it. You're a big and very old boy." Tim replies, "Besides all you need to do is be seen by one of them at least once within five feet of me and it's game over for them. Ground rule number three is no talking to other people about...us."</p><p>"Is there an us now, Timothy?"</p><p>"When you talk about us there is. You make it sound like we're in some sort of twisted mentor-student romance. Which we aren't. Because you aren't my mentor, and we're not in a romance." Tim adjusts Ra's tie, "And you couldn't have picked a better color tie?"</p><p>"I'm told that this shade of silver goes well with my skin tone."</p><p>"It matches your hair." Tim snorts, smoothing down the front of Ra's suit, "Okay. So, we've got the ground rules established."</p><p>"I don' get a say in the ground rules?"</p><p>"No, because I firmly believe that it's good for you to not be in control of the rules every so often."</p><p>"I am rarely in control of the rules when you are involved."</p><p>"Exactly how I like it." Tim flashes a smile, "Now, let's go. The sooner we get seen the faster you can get out of Gotham."</p><p>
  <strong>me-ya-ri:</strong>
</p><p>"Well this is important! You can like - postpone your plans for world domination for the two minutes or less it's going to take us to get through this conversation."</p><p>"And I am telling you, that as important as whatever it is you wish to discuss is, this is more so. We both agreed that our duties come before our relationship, as it is necessary to hold that line between us, and secondary for us to be an <em>us</em>."</p><p>"<em>For the love of fuck</em>, Ra's! All I want to know is if you've put out a hit on Jason lately! That's it! That's all I want to know!"</p><p>"Why would I put a hit out on Todd?"</p><p>"I don't know! I'm asking you! We agreed no more hits on family."</p><p>"We also agreed no more unnecessary expenditure, but yet here we are." Ra's taps his finger on a credit card statement, "I gave you the card so you wouldn't be in need if you ever got separated from your family's resources, not so you could support the Superman franchise."</p><p>Tim rolls his eyes, "Then cancel the card!"</p><p>"The last time I cancelled the card you ended up fighting for your life in the middle of Turkey because the satellites were down and you had to resort to burglary. Did you have to steal from that diplomat?"</p><p>"He was a total dick! And we're not turning this on me! This is about you putting a hit out on Jason!"</p><p>"I did not put a hit out on Todd. I have no reason to put a hit out on Todd. That's a waste in resources."</p><p>"That's it! That's all I needed to know! We could've avoided this whole fucking conversation if you could just say <em>no, Tim, I didn't put a hit out on Jason</em>. But no you had to drag it out. Ugh."</p><p>
  <strong>fair-strife:</strong>
</p><p>"Of course we're in a weird Victorian era romance." Tim says, causing Dick to give him the stink-eye. "I mean, if I were a lady and he were a gentleman, if we were romantically interested in each other, if we didn't try to kill or otherwise harm the other for fun, and consider psychological warfare as normal small-talk. Yeah, sure we're in a romance, Dick. I mean, who doesn't want a thousand year old crime lord asking for their lily-pale hand in marriage to live in middle-class domestic bliss?"</p><p>"You mock the idea, sure." Dick says, "But in practice, it's not really funny. Because from where I'm standing it sure does look like you're headed towards that domestic bliss."</p><p>"Please, he'd sooner kill me than kiss me."</p><p>"Uh-huh. Right." Dick raises a skeptical eyebrow. "Sure. That's why he's so invested in needling you into changing your eating and sleeping habits. Yeah, Tim. Sure, he's going to kill you. Seems like a lot of wasted time and effort after all the trouble he's gone through to keep you alive and healthy. But of <em>course</em> that's all in the name of bringing you down."</p><p>"I don't like that tone of voice." Tim says, narrowing his eyes. "Besides, this is pretty much normal behavior for him."</p><p>"To you, maybe. I'm pretty sure that if he really wanted you dead you'd be dead. No offense to your talents, Tim."</p><p>"You're ridiculous, Dick. And do you think that fruit basket he sent us passed the drug test? Because I'm running low on vitamin D."</p><p>
  <strong>kyrdwn:</strong>
</p><p>"Was this necessary?" Ra's asks as Tim calmly folds himself onto the ice next to him, "I wasn't aware that I even had a base here."</p><p>"Well, now you do." Tim replies, "And of course it was necessary. Not all of us have the luxury of being able to go wherever we want without answering to someone."</p><p>"So you engineer a planetary crisis?" Ra's raises an eyebrow, "I'd almost be impressed if I wasn't so fed up with the extremes to which you're taking this."</p><p>"It's not so much a planetary crisis so much as it is a safety drill." Tim replies. After all, everyone's aware that the danger isn't real. They might just be forgetting that at the moment, considering that they've all been randomly teleported to different locations. "Like, what do you do when you find yourself in someone else's city? I think this is something we need to figure out."</p><p>"Someone is going to kill you someday. It most likely will not be me." Ra's sighs, pulling the young man close, letting his cloak fold over the both of them. "A shame, really."</p><p>"You couldn't get rid of me even if you wanted to." Tim mutters, rubbing his nose, "I was about to say <em>even if you tried </em>but then I remembered that you've tried multiple times. And, obviously, failed."</p><p>"You have yet to see me really try."</p><p>"Please. Your livid face as you kick me out a window was totally full-hearted. And you don't half-ass things." Tim sniffles, pulling his knees up to his chest. "Also, if you ever actually tried I bet I could take your attempt out faster than your attempt could take me out."</p><p>"As interesting as that would be to test, I would rather leave that as a hypothetical. I do try not to make it a habit to make young, terrifying, and beautiful creatures such as yourself into enemies."</p><p>"Did you just call me a creature?"</p><p>"Well, Detective. I was going to say <em>beings</em> but somehow the idea of lumping you in with the rest of the human species feels like an insult. Your nose is incredibly red. Should I get you a pair of antlers and a bell to go with it?"</p><p>"Did you just call me Rudolph?"</p><p>"In a very round-about way."</p><p>"Rudolph is an incorrect story and incredibly detrimental to children everywhere." Tim says, covering his nose and breathing into his hands, "I would know. It's one of Jason's favorite Christmas-time rants."</p><p>"Perhaps the next time we meet, you could engineer a less...extreme way for us to do so. In somewhat more mild location. Perhaps, say, Fresno. Or Los Angeles."</p><p>"The Titans are in California." Tim protests. "And I hate your penthouse in L.A. The view is cliched and terrible and the freeway congestion is awful."</p><p>"You are nothing but complaints, are you?"</p><p>"Only about you."</p><p>
  <strong>kanetomojiretsu:</strong>
</p><p>Ra's only looks faintly amused by Tim's expression, and that's probably what clues Tim in to the fact that Ra's doesn't really want to do this so much as he's - well - doing it out of some strange sense of obligation, and or the fact that he's half-heartedly attempting at playing nice.</p><p>"You brought me roses." Tim says, eyebrow raising as he takes the flowers, tied in silk - impressive, but not really - and goes through them for any traps. Ra's would probably be a little disappointed if he didn't, despite the fact that they both know Ra's wouldn't resort to such petty gimmicks. "Not that I'm unappreciative of a good floral arrangement, but I'm going to have to ask why. Like - did you fuck up and I don't know about it yet, or are you about to fuck something up and want to earn forgiveness in advance, or what?"</p><p>"I can't just bring my beloved one flowers when the mood strikes me?"</p><p>"No." Tim replies, gently setting the flowers down on the hallway table, stepping aside for Ra's to come in. Let me in, let me in little pig, let me come in. "Because when your normal mood strikes you, you tend to send some hit-men to strike at me. And then I end up sending them back to you with little notes safety pinned to their shirts so they don't lose them."</p><p>"Perhaps I wanted to be kind to you."  Ra's replies, taking of his coat and scarf, "Or something along that sentiment."</p><p>"Your version of kind is sending me pain killers and trails to my dead end cases." Tim says, "Coffee or water?"</p><p>"Coffee is fine." Ra's says, taking a seat in Tim's living room, crossing his legs, "Your reception of the flowers is - shall I call it tepid? Luke-warm?"</p><p>"At best."</p><p>"Luke-warm, then. Is this how you're going to react to dinner reservations?"</p><p>"Now I'm really concerned." Tim replies, handing Ra's the coffee. "No cream, two sugars."</p><p>"Thank you. And it has been pointed out to me that I should treat those I consider mine with better respect. And more - how was it phrase? Benefits."</p><p>Tim crosses his arms. "I meant your employees. I meant health care and a 401k. I didn't mean take me out to dinner, I feel under-appreciated."</p><p>"Should I cancel dinner plans?"</p><p>Tim narrows his eyes. "Where are the reservations at?"</p><p>"The new Korean restaurant in downtown Gotham."</p><p>"The one that takes about a month to get into?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Tim narrows his eyes further. Ra's hums and sips his coffee.</p><p>"What time are these reservations at?"</p><p>"Later this evening. I had planned to give you time to make the proper excuses and what-not." Ra's raises an eyebrow, "You do so often scold me for being inconsiderate of your situation."</p><p>"Ok. Here's what I'm going to do. I'm going to eat that entire restaurant out of food and maybe get banned for life." Tim declares, turning on his heel, "And stop getting onto my good side with food. It makes me predictable."</p><p>"And don't we hate it when you feel predictable."</p><p>"And stop using the royal we! It makes you sound creepy."</p><p>
  <strong>essentialprocrastination:</strong>
</p><p>"You mean to tell me that you - and your team - is currently hosting ancient and psychopathic evil hoard of demons. That you will give birth to." Ra's says, rubbing his temples as Timothy glares at him -</p><p>"You make it sound like we do this on purpose."</p><p>"Do you?" Ra's asks, because he has to at this point, "Did you or did you not provoke whatever it is that - <em>impregnated</em> your team?"</p><p>"I didn't. Ravager might've." The man replies, rolling his shoulders back, "And if you could hurry it along with some research or something, anything, we'd really appreciate it. In fact, we'd appreciate it so much we might even lay off taking down your naval forces in the Gulf of Mexico. Because it's been about three days and we already look three months pregnant."</p><p>Ra's is struck with the incredible urge to ask if he can see, but he'd rather not be scarred with that mental image for however many decades it takes him to mentally block it out.</p><p>"Look. I don't want man-babies, okay. And I'm pretty sure I'm speaking for the rest of my team when I say none of us want to be teen-mom's and teen-dad's. Especially  not through magical impregnation from a hostile...um. Donor." Timothy wrinkles his nose. "This is serious and terrifying and I really need you to be supportive of me, okay. Because that's - apparently - what consenting partners in a healthy relationship do."</p><p>"I wasn't aware that we are in a relationship." Ra's points out, "How did you even get this computer, anyway?"</p><p>"I broke into your ninja's hotel room." Tim waves a hand, "That's not important right now. What's important is that we've been connected through a series of events and you're invested in me and I'm somewhat invested in you, and that's close enough to a relationship isn't it?"</p><p>"You broke into my ninja's hotel room while you're three months pregnant with a hostile magical parasite?" Ra's raises his eyebrows, "I'm impressed. And mildly disturbed. Send blood panels and any information concerning the matter to me. I'll have a team on it."</p><p>"Okay, but can you - I don't know, rush order it, because we might all be dead in about six days when these things rip out of our abdomens." </p>

  <p>-</p><p>"Ra's, what an unpleasant surprise." Tim says, leaning against the doorframe, "To what do I owe the – " Tim waves a hand, "I'd say pleasure, but it really, really isn't."</p><p>"Let me in before the paparazzi see and start spinning rumors." Ra's says, "I have no desire to be on the front pages of the trash you call a respectable newspaper."</p><p>Tim rolls his eyes, but steps aside and lets the man in anyway. The paparazzi do tend to come around – unfortunately – pretty early in the morning. Tim's pretty sure it's because his siblings have a habit of walking around half naked on his property, and his hedges aren't quite tall enough to block the property.</p><p>Tim sets the locks, and is completely unsurprised to find that Ra's has disappeared somewhere into his brownstone. He's going to be picking out bugs out of every single surface for <em>weeks</em>. Tim yawns, scratches his stomach – it's too early for this. Tim should've just ignored the alarm and let Ra's stand on his doorstep until a decent hour.</p><p>Knowing the stubborn ass, he'd stand there and wait.</p><p>He finds Ra's in the kitchen, working Tim's French press – a moving in present from Cassie, "Tim, I know you. I've known you since you were barely five feet tall. There's no way anything in this house is getting done until you have a decent coffee maker. One that makes rocket fuel, probably. But science isn't there yet, so here you go." – his outer coat folded over the back of a chair, and a simple manila folder on Tim's counter.</p><p>"You aren't dressed." Ra's says, Tim rolls his eyes, flipping the folder open. If Ra's didn't want him looking, he wouldn't be so damn obvious.</p><p>"It's barely seven in the morning, why would I be dressed?" Tim replies, "And why are you so blatantly throwing down information about a take over of W.E. in front of me?"</p><p>"Because it isn't <em>my</em> take over, and nothing annoys me nearly as much as you being distracted by other things when there are more interesting things I could be using you for."</p><p>Tim raises an eyebrow, hand held out for the coffee Ra's gives him. Ra's sighs.</p><p>"By which I mean there are other things which deserve your attention more than these petty attempts."</p><p>"You must be the most high maintenance and needy arch nemesis anyone has ever had." Tim replies, "Thank you, I'll look into it. But you didn't really come here just to give me this, did you?"</p><p>"You took out all the cameras." Ra's says after a moment. He sounds so much like Damian when he's being petulant and embarrassed that it's uncanny.</p><p>"Not true." Tim says, pointing at the one in the corner of the living room.</p><p>"You painted over it."</p><p>"Yeah, but it's still <em>there</em>." Tim narrows his eyes, "Were you <em>lonely</em>?"</p><p>Ra's levels an unimpressed look at him.</p><p>Tim rests his cheek on his palm, resists the urge to coo. "How sweet."</p><p>"You annoy me at the best of times, Timothy. Don't be ludicrous." Ra's starts going through Tim's refrigerator. "We're going out for lunch."</p><p>"Are we?"</p><p>"Yes. We are. It annoys me when your mentor sends your siblings to tail me. Out of all my options you're the least annoying of them."</p><p>Tim mentally translates that, "You're going soft in your old age. You can just say that you want to hang out."</p><p>He's fairly sure that the words <em>hang out</em> bring Ra's physical pain.</p><p>"We're also buying you groceries." Ra's says, "How you've managed to survive up to this point is always a mystery to me."</p><p>-</p><p>"On the list of inappropriate people for you to have sex with, he isn't on the list because I would think he doesn't bear mentioning. But if he was on the list, do you know where he'd be? In the title. The <em>title</em>, Tim." Stephanie says, "Your choice in men is terrible. Your choices in women is sometimes questionable, but that's okay because it tends to balance out. But your choice in dicks is <em>terrible</em>."</p><p>"Excuse me, but I object to that." Tim frowns, waving his hand. "I mean. You liked my brother for ages."</p><p>"Yeah but I've learned about how much of an asshole he is. And that's not fair, hero worship doesn't count."</p><p>"If hero worship doesn't count – "</p><p>Stephanie jabs a finger in his face, "The difference is that I <em>stopped</em> at hero worship. You keep liking them even after you get to know them and realize how annoying they are."</p><p>Tim opens his mouth, closes it, "I can't actually object to that, can I?"</p><p>"No, you can't. Also – back to the topic. <em>Ra's al frickin Ghul</em>. He's the grandad of your <em>brother</em>. Your <em>dad</em> has banged his daughter. How can you – wasn't he married to Black Canary?"</p><p>Tim winces, "We don't talk about past relationships."</p><p>"Aha! So you admit you guys have a relationship!"</p><p>"Well." Tim waves his hands, "I mean. As much as – like – <em>enemies is a type of relationship</em>."</p><p>"I don't know what you're trying to sell, but I ain't buying it." Stephanie snorts. "You and Ra's al Ghul. Christ. Why am I even surprised at this point – you two have so much weird creepy tension that it should've been obvious. And don't bother looking offended by me."</p><p>Tim frowns. "We don't have tension."</p><p>"You're in such denial it's a little sad." Stephanie sighs, patting his cheek, "You'll figure it out. Eventually. Probably when you're in the middle of something – like bouncing on his dick or trying to slit his throat. But you'll figure it out."</p><p>-</p><p>"This is a very bad time." Tim says, into the phone.</p><p>"You turned off all the security on the top three floors of the W.E. building." Bruce says. "And I can't get access back."</p><p>"Yes." Tim says, shifting his weight, digging his elbow behind him – Ra's grunts, "I mean. Yeah."</p><p>There's a pause. Tim smacks Ra's hand away from the phone – mouths, <em>Put your pants on</em>.</p><p>"I'm fifteen minutes away. Is there anything you'd like to tell me?" Bruce says, and Tim's eyes dart towards the windows. and he hopes to god that Bruce comes in through the door because something about Batman smashing through a window into this situation just makes Tim want to.</p><p>Barf.</p><p>Die.</p><p>Slam his head into a wall.</p><p>All of the above. Repeatedly.</p><p>Tim reaches down, blindly feels around then throws whatever article of clothing he finds first at Ra's chest. The man just rolls his eyes.</p><p>"I love you and I hope you respect my privacy?" Tim says, winces at the dead silence on the other end. "I'll clean it up? I didn't contaminate anything? I used protection?"</p><p>"<em>Tim</em>."</p><p>"Ra's al Ghul is in Gotham?"</p><p>Tim hears Bruce let out one long – <em>long</em> – breath that makes the phone crackle with static.</p><p>"Are you finished?"</p><p>Tim is hoping that Bruce means with talking -</p><p>"Are any of his body parts in contact with you?" Bruce clarifies, and Tim chokes. A terrible move because it gives Ra's the opening he needs to steal the phone from him -</p><p>"Hello Bruce, you've called at a bad time."</p><p>Tim winces, smacks Ra's hand off his back and goes to find his pants. Ra's traces his fingers down Tim's spine, as he continues to – probably – piss Bruce off even more. The asshole has the nerve to look <em>calm</em> about the entire thing.</p><p>Tim finds his underwear and pants just fine. His shirt is on top of the decorative plant display in the corner for some reason. His jacket is somehow still pristine and unwrinkled where he left it when he first came into the office that morning – on the back of the office chair that Ra's is now reclining in. Tim glares and yanks the jacket out, ignores Ra's amused look and goes to find his socks.</p><p>He's found everything but the tie, which – when he turns around, Ra's is twirling around one of his long fingers. And he's <em>still talking</em> to Bruce.</p><p>Tim narrows his eyes, moves to snatch the tie from Ra's – ends up grabbing at empty air as Ra's dodges and moves towards the windows.</p><p>"I hope Batman crashes into you boot first." Tim hisses. He can live without the tie.</p><p>Batman does <em>not</em> crash into the window boot first, but he does crash through the door and throw a batarang at Ra's face.</p><p>Tim tucks himself into a corner of the couch, wishes he kept more cans of Febreeze on hand like Jason suggested, and waits.</p><p>As Batman swoops past he snaps off a curt – "<em>Don't move. We'll talk later</em>." Technically he gets a grunt and a frown. But Tim's competent in Bruce-speak.</p><p>Bruce is going to rip him a new one.</p><p>Tim glares at Ra's. And he hopes that Bruce stabs him in the face. He'll recover but the pain would be terrible.</p>
