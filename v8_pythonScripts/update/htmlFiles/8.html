</p><p>Tim wakes up because he feels someone coming into his room. He feels someone coming into his room because they sound like a drunk elephant wearing tap shoes. Tim groans and shoves his head underneath a pillow -</p><p>"What the fuck is your problem, Cassie." Tim feels Cassie tugging at the sheets, grunts when she gives up and just flops down on top of him. "You smell like shit, go brush your teeth, <em>ugh</em>. It's like, two in the morning, why do you do this to me."</p><p>Cassie laughs, "You're such a big baby."</p><p>"Go brush your teeth, your morning breath could kill – "</p><p>"I can't, Bart keeps moving my toothbrush to his place."</p><p>"<em>Use mine</em>." Tim mutters, blinding reaching out and shoving at what he hopes is her face. "You're a terrible person."</p><p>Cassie pokes his butt and goes to brush her teeth. "We're also out of tampons, by the way."</p><p>"It's <em>two in the morning, Cassie</em>. I'm not dealing with your lack of tampons – it's not even you <em>cycle</em> yet. Put it on the list, Bart can get them on his morning food run."</p><p>Tim falls asleep by the time she's done, and he briefly wakes up to her manhandling him into a better sleeping position which involves him being half of a big spoon. He presses his nose against her soft hair and goes to sleep.</p><p>"Night, Tim." Cassie yawns.</p><p>"You suck." Tim mumbles.</p><p>-</p><p>"Oh my <em>god</em>, Tim, if you're going to sleep with my girlfriend you could at least invite me to <em>join you</em>." Kon says and Tim has two seconds to brace himself before he's crushed by how many pounds of alien. "I feel so left out, guys. <em>Rude</em>. I even brought you breakfast and everything – "</p><p>The door slams open and Tim internally cringes for the state of his drywall -</p><p>"Guys, guys, up and at them, let's do some early morning exercises – and <em>hey, why are you guys all in bed together</em>. What about <em>me</em>, you guys are <em>horrible</em> – "</p><p>"I can't breathe." Tim wheezes out as Bart jumps on top of Kon, who is on top of Tim, who is also somewhat buried underneath Cassie. "I'm gonna die."</p><p>"That's what you get for not calling to tell me that there's a cuddle pile." Bart says, Tim cracks one eye open and groans -</p><p>"What time is it?"</p><p>"Six." Kon says and Tim squeezes his eyes shut.</p><p>"You are all are such assholes."</p><p>Cassie snores in his ear.</p><p>"Is there coffee? Please god let there be coffee." Tim says, trying to worm out from underneath their pile – "It's too early for there to not be coffee – "</p><p>Kon taps his nose – "There's no coffee because Ma said you were growing <em>way</em> too dependent on the stuff – "</p><p>Tim gapes, "You <em>traitor</em>. How <em>could you tell Ma</em>."</p><p>" – but we've got tea and juice." Bart pitches in, "Freshly squeezed. You know it's the good stuff."</p><p>"The good stuff is a direct shot of coffee into my <em>blood stream</em>." Tim mutters, dragging himself half off the bed before giving up. "Is anyone actually going to get up."</p><p>"No." Cassie says, arms firmly locked around his waist, face pressed against his side. "You're the best pillow ever."</p><p>"You know, now that I'm lying down I think I'mma nap. Morning chores suck." Kon says, closing his eyes.</p><p>"Me too!" Bart says, tucking himself in the space next to Kon and the edge of the bed. "Gotta get the cuddles when you can, right?"</p><p>Tim stares at them, half twisted off the bed. "Guys. I've got to go to <em>work</em>. Guys – c'mon, this isn't <em>fair</em>."</p><p>"Go be an adult, Tim. Do it for the vine." Bart whispers. "Be an adult for all of us."</p><p>"Take one for the team." Cassie adds in. "And may the odds ever be in your favor."</p><p>-</p><p>"Aw, yeah, Tim go get it." Bart whistles as Tim adjusts his tie -</p><p>Cassie is doing something on her  phone that's somehow bringing up the background sounds of porn music. Tim knows it's porn music because he's walked in on her enough times to know what kind of porn she likes and what kind of music is <em>in</em> said porn. Fuck she doesn't even bother hiding it anymore. Tim's pretty sure that Dick's come in here, found the porn, and thought it was <em>his</em>.</p><p>"Could you not." Tim says while Kon croons – <em>work it, Mister Wayne</em>. "Oh my god, I'm going to be scarred for life." Tim runs his hands through his hair because apparently slicking it back makes him look something like respectable and helps people forget that he's technically a high school drop out. "Don't you guys have better things to do?"</p><p>"Well," Kon says, "I'm going to take our laundry to the farm because it's either that or have one of you guys do it and have it smell like rank city air."</p><p>"You sound like such a country bumpkin." Bart says, "I'll go with you – "</p><p>"Don't forget my tampons." Cassie adds in as she cranks up the volume. Tim swears to god that they're lucky he's not in an apartment because he's pretty sure someone'd have called the cops on them by now. Hello, police, I think there's a porn ring operating next door.</p><p>Tim shoots a longing look towards the bed – "Nap in my name?"</p><p>They shoot him solemn looks, "For you, we will always nap."</p><p>-</p><p>"Are we going to do this every time." Tim groans as he undoes his tie, Cassie's got new music and she's put her cell phone on the music doc so the beats are pulsing through the air. "Guys, <em>please</em>."</p><p>Bart is throwing dollar bills at him and Kon swoons into Cassie's arms, fanning his face – Kon sighs in a falsetto – "He's so <em>handsome</em>."</p><p>"I hate everyone in this <em>house</em>." Tim declares, throwing his suit jacket at Bart's face, "And what kind of cheap stripper do you think I <em>am</em>, at least throw a five in here somewhere."</p><p>"Not everyone's made of money." Bart says, "Be thankful I'm not just throwing monopoly bills at you."</p><p>Tim rolls his eyes and slams the bathroom door shut.</p><p>"I've got <em>x-ray vision, Tim</em>. I can just narrate this." Kon says, "And what stripper name do you want?"</p><p>"I don't want to be a stripper, Kon." Tim says, rolling his eyes towards the ceiling, "I just want to eat like – a six pound burger and a bucket of fries with an obnoxiously fizzy drink."</p><p>"How badly do you want it?" Cassie says, "Work that money maker Tim. <em>Work it</em>. No – <em>twerk it</em>."</p><p>"Fuck you all side-ways. I'm not twerking for food."</p><p>"Twerk because you love us?"</p><p>"<em>No</em>."</p><p>-</p><p>"What the fucking even guys." Bart says, smacking them all upside the head with a newspaper. "I thought there was a rule against Pacific Rim."</p><p>"Pain is pleasure." Cassie deadpans, "And I love me some Idris Elba."</p><p>"Yancy." Kon whispers, reaching around to drag Bart down and onto his lap, "Bart, <em>Yancy</em>."</p><p>Bart smacks Tim's phone out of his hands, and Kon levitates it across the room. "Pay attention to us, Tim."</p><p>"No, that was important – " Tim says, making <em>gimme</em> hands, "I'm trying to figure out who's stuff is what, because I'm pretty sure the underwear I'm wearing doesn't belong to anyone in this room and it's confusing me."</p><p>The other three take the moment to stare at his crotch. Cassie stares down at her sports bra -</p><p>"Now that you mention it, I'm pretty sure this isn't mine. Or Bart's."</p><p>Bart snorts, "Please, I would never get a bra like that. It doesn't match my aesthetic."</p><p>"It could be your sister's." Kon points out, "I mean, Cass was here for a while a few months ago, right?"</p><p>"Maybe." Tim says, squinting at Cassie's bra. "I mean. Yeah, probably, they're her colors." Kon brings the phone back, Cassie leans forward for Tim to take a picture. "Ok, asking her right now."</p><p>"Cool, can you ask her if she has my Wonder Woman basketball shorts?" Cassie says, and Bart snaps his fingers -</p><p>"I got those! They're at the laundry at the Tower." Bart twists around until he's sprawled out over all three of them, head on Tim's lap. Kon throws an arm around Cassie and Tim's shoulders. "Hey, Tim, can you ask your sister what nail polish brand she uses, because last time she was here she had some fierce matte gray."</p><p>"Okay so the bra isn't hers – which  means that I officially have no ideas where the fuck it came from – and you can text her about the nail polish." Tim hands Bart the phone, "Also I'm with Bart. I am not emotionally prepared to watch Yancy again."</p><p>"You guys are such fucking babies." Cassie snorts, reaching around to pinch Tim's ear. "God, fine, we'll watch <em>The Hour</em>."</p><p>Kon groans, Bart gasps and clutches at his heart, and Tim puts his face in his hands.</p><p>-</p><p>"Okay guys. Fine. I'll just stay here and not help you when you fuck up." Red Robin says, cape rustling from where everyone sped off. Tim folds his arms and wonders how Bruce ever deals with this.</p><p>Bart is back, a blur that comes to a stop on his knees with his arms out flung, eyes wide behind his goggles, "<em>Come into my arms, Princess</em>."</p><p>Tim snorts and a few seconds later Bart is yelping as Kon pushes him to the side, hovering with his own arms outspread, "No, come into <em>mine</em>."</p><p>Tim raises an eyebrow, and knows that they can tell even with the cowl because they start bickering. Tim laughs when Cassie's lasso gently circles around him -</p><p>"Please,  you losers. You don't know how it's done. Come on, all aboard, Air Wondergirl." Cassie says, gently pulling Tim towards her, Tim sighs -</p><p>"Oh, Wondergirl, you're just so much <em>man for me</em>." Tim reaches up, arms around her neck as she lifts him, "These brutes don't know how to handle a delicate flower like me."</p><p>Kon gasps and Bart huffs -</p><p>"<em>You</em>," Tim points as Cassie hovers, "lift me like a sack of potatoes."</p><p>"You love my manly shoulders." Kon says -</p><p>"Not when your manly shoulders are eviscerating my internal organs."</p><p>Bart laughs -</p><p>"And like you're one to make fun, Mr. Stick-person. It's like you hit every pothole on <em>purpose</em>." Tim points as Bart zips away – "Away we go."</p><p>Kon laughs as Cassie carries him away.</p><p> </p>

</p><p>"I am an adult - I don't need supervision." Tim snaps, and Dick raises his eyebrow. Tim turns around in time to see Kon and Bart streaking through the hallway waving Cassie's bras around in the air. Cassie follows afterwards in one of Tim's Batman shirts- those are supposed to be <em>secret</em> and sacred damn it - yelling about blood and how there'll be so much of it the <em>Rains of Castamere</em> will look like a paper cut. Tim turns back to the screen and regrets, not for the first time, having his room arranged so that his computer screen faces the door. "They totally don't count against me."</p><p>Tim is an adult, he never said that the people around him were.</p><p>Dick hums, "Should I be worried or should I be sending condoms?"</p><p>"Bart did a condom run this morning, it's fine." Tim says, and Dick's eyebrows raise higher - Tim pauses, thinks it over, "I should probably clarify that I'm not one of the people using the condoms."</p><p>Dick opens his mouth - </p><p>"And it's because I'm not the one having sex so there's no need for me to." Tim pinches the bridge of his nose. "Why would you think I'm having sex. God, Dick. Just because the first generation of Titans were in a giant polyamorous relationship doesn't mean <em>every</em> generation is."</p><p>"I just saw Superboy, Kid Flash, and Wondergirl streaking through your house, Tim. And don't think I can't hear the subtle beats of pornography music in the background." Dick jabs his finger at him through the screen. "We're having a talk when I figure out how to do this without wanting to pry or bash my head in."</p><p>"Can we just pretend we had a talk?" Tim asks. And for a second, Tim thinks that Dick's going to agree, but Cassie flies into the doorway and says -</p><p>"Should I go with strawberries or whipped cream as punishment?"</p><p>And on reflex Tim answers - "Things didn't go so well with the whipped cream last time, remember the rules. If there's going to be bodily fluids involved don't involve edible fluids and amorphous solids. It's just <em>asking</em> for some sort of disease."</p><p>Cassie floats out of the room and Dick is giving him a <em>look</em>. Tim opens his mouth - closes it.</p><p>"There's nothing I can say here to convince you I'm not having extremely kinky sex with three other people, is there?"</p><p>Dick is quiet for a moment - "Well. If it's just strawberries and whipped cream it isn't that kinky. I'll reserve judgement for when you guys get into leather and chains."</p><p>-</p><p>"Guys where the fuck are my clothes." Kon says, and he swears he's got like, at least a dozen S-shield shirts here but he can't find any of them. "Guys - it's my uniform, I can't just <em>not</em> wear it, okay - "</p><p>Bart zips in, flopping onto the bed with a soft grunt, "Tim's wearing one."</p><p>"And where are the other eleven?" Tim has one of <em>everything</em>. Kon swears that Tim doesn't have clothes of his own and just cycles through everyone else's wardrobes. He's pretty sure that he doesn't think of anything as his own until Tim's worn it at least twice and he's had to go on a clothes-finding expedition through Tim's collection of clothes that aren't his. Because if Tim's worn it more than once and has attempted to assimilate it into his closet without you  noticing, that means it <em>has</em> to be good.</p><p>It makes sense because Tim's crazy like that. It'd be kind of cute if it'd leave clothes left for Kon to wear.</p><p>"That's what I want to know. And how come this never happens to you?"</p><p>"Unlike you, I have an <em>actual</em> uniform. It'd be kind of hard for you guys to just walk around in my spandex, yeah?" Bart says, chewing on a Twizzler. "Anyone can steal one of your shirts because they're sold practically <em>everywhere</em>."</p><p>"A good thing considering how often I have to get new ones. The royalties practically pay for me to get more of them." Kon wrinkles his nose. "It's kind of like a vicious cycle, when I think of it. Maybe I should go back to spandex or something, what do you think?"</p><p>"I think it'd be harder for Cassie to peel you out of your clothes and you'd both end up just sexing in the hallway." Bart replies. "And I'd trip over you, maybe, and Tim'd complain because you'd be knocking pictures off the walls."</p><p>"Tim complains about that <em>anyway</em>." Kon digs through the dresser drawers, "All I can find is a Superman T-shirt with pink glitter, a Blue Lantern T-shirt - I didn't even know they <em>made</em> those -, and a Wonder Woman crop top."</p><p>Kon is pretty sure they're all Tim's. Even the crop top. Especially the crop top. Cassie probably gave it to him, or Jason. Who knows?</p><p>He stares at his choices before pulling on the crop top.</p><p>Bart whistles, "You gonna get some daisy dukes to go with that, cowboy?"</p><p>Kon strikes a pose. "How do I look?"</p><p>"Div<em>ine</em>." Bart drawls, flinging his arms out, "Simply <em>divine</em>, darling."</p><p>-</p><p>"There are three rules in this house." Tim declares, throwing the door open, Cassie continues to paint Bart's toenails lavender. "One. Don't tell <em>Alfred</em>. Two. Don't tell <em>Ma</em>. Three. Don't talk about Fight Club. Is that so hard? Is it?"</p><p>"What happened?" Bart says, waving his fingers to get the pastel yellow to dry faster. "Who talked?"</p><p>"One of you tattles told Ma about the spleen, that's what happened!" Tim says, flopping face-first onto the sofa. "Why would any of you do that. What is actually wrong with you."</p><p>"Ma worries." Cassie says, "You used to visit so often. Then you dropped off the face of the Earth, and she only hears about you in tabloids and gossip reels."</p><p>"She mourns how grown up you look." Bart adds in, "She keeps trying to get us to drag you over for dinner. She feels <em>neglected</em>, Tim. You are <em>neglecting</em> Ma. This is your punishment."</p><p>Tim kicks his legs in the air, "She guilted <em>me</em>, she <em>guilted</em> me."</p><p>"Good. Someone has to guilt you into taking care of yourself." Cassie mutters, "If you don't stop kicking I'm going to make a mistake on Bart's nails, then I'm going to make a mistake on your face."</p><p>"Who says my face isn't already a mistake?"</p><p>"Oh, Tim - do we need to tell Ma you're having self-esteem issues, too?" Bart sighs. Tim groans.</p><p>-</p><p>"There was concern expressed at me living part-time with three <em>boys</em>." Cassie says, "Emphasis on boys, not men. Except Tim. Tim can count as a man because he pays the bills and foots the expenses."</p><p>"Thanks."</p><p>"Consider yourself our bankroll with testicles." Kon says, Tim throws a fork at his face.</p><p>"I'm so flattered."</p><p>"If it makes a difference, you're more than just a blank check with a dick to me, Tim." Bart says, arms around Tim's waist. "You're a <em>pretty</em> blank check that wears Hugo Boss." Bart kisses Tim's cheek, "And you talk theory with me."</p><p>Tim shoves fork of mashed potatoes into Bart's mouth. "Stop it, I'm going to get an <em>ego</em> at the rate you're going."</p><p>"The <em>point</em> is, there is concern expressed about me, the <em>delicate flower</em>, growing amongst you weeds. And I guess Tim can be a tree or something."</p><p>"Or something." Tim mutters, Kon snorts -</p><p>"Did someone actually call you a delicate flower?" His eyes crinkle a little with his smile, and Cassie loves him, she swears she does, but sometimes she wants to give him an uppercut straight into the path of an airplane.</p><p>"I am such a delicate princess, don't you even start with me, asshole."</p><p>"If you're a flower, you're probably something poisonous and like - I don't know. Detrimental to the poor weeds around it." Kon snorts. "Delicate flower my ass, I swear - everyone knows who wears the pants around here."</p><p>Cassie kicks him under the table. "I am totally a flower!"</p><p>"A cactus flower?" Bart pitches in - Cassie glares. Bart holds his hands up in surrender. "Well, if there's anyone who's the flower around here it's you. Whatever kind it is."</p><p>"Thank you, Bart."</p><p>"I mean - it would be Tim, except Tim totally fails at life without us around."</p><p>"Every time you open your mouth, a little part of me withers away and dies." Tim says as Bart talks over him  -</p><p>"Hey! I know. If Cassie's the flower, that makes Kon the butterfly, and I'm the rain, and Tim's the dirt."</p><p>Tim throws his arms up in the air, as Kon hums - "What kind of butterfly?"</p><p>"I like this analogy." Cassie says as Tim sullenly shoves potato into his mouth. She reaches over and squeezes Tim's hand. "It's a backhanded compliment, but it's a compliment."</p><p>"No!" Bart says, "Think about it! Tim's our foundation and he brought us all together and he keeps us up and everything. And Cassie's sort of like our face? She's the pretty one and she's probably the most normal out of all of us and she's great. And Kon's the squishy baby caterpillar who metamorphosed - metamorphized? Metamorphed? - into this masculine stud of a butterfly. And I'm the glorious rain that comes and goes and brings you all zest and cheer and rainbows. It <em>totally</em> works."</p><p>Tim snorts, "Back to the point of Cassie being our delicate flower, why was this topic being brought up?"</p><p>"There was concern for my safety." Cassie rolls her eyes, "Then I lifted a car and threw it at a rampaging robot about to crush the reporter's van and I think I pretty much killed that train of thought."</p>

</p><p>"This is why everyone thinks I'm living a highly adventurous life style." Tim says, "You can't just – like – have sex in my room and not tell me. My brothers come in through that window regularly. They check my trash."</p><p>"Why do your brothers check your trash?" Cassie asks, which is not the point here.</p><p>"It's <em>Gotham</em>, Cassie." Kon says when Tim just stares at her. "They're <em>Bats</em>. It's how they show they care."</p><p>"Wait – what, <em>no</em>." Tim turns on Kon, "It's not showing they care, it's them being nosy and looking for blackmail material. Now they have your used condoms."</p><p>"That is so fucking gross." Kon wrinkles his nose. "Dude."</p><p>"<em>You're the ones who had sex in my room without warning me!</em>" Tim throws his hands up, "If you could've just given me a heads up I could've – gotten rid of the evidence? Planted decoys? I don't know!"</p><p>"Or you guys could have sex in your own room." Bart points out from the door before he goes off again. "Just saying."</p><p>"Or that." Tim agrees, "Yeah. Why don't you just do that?"</p><p>"Do you mind us having sex in your room?"</p><p>"Well. Yeah. When I'm in the room." Tim says, "And when you don't give me a heads up so I can <em>divert my brother's attention elsewhere?</em>"</p><p>"I'm sorry, next time we'll give you a heads up." Cassie says, flopping down on Tim's bed. "Also something about your bed is really nice. It's the same mattress we have and everything but it's super bouncy."</p><p>"It's the exact same – " Tim waves his hand. "It's the exact same everything, though?"</p><p>"I think it's like you and other people's coffee." Kon says, "It's just better."</p><p>"Oh." Tim frowns. "Well. Okay. Fine. Whatever, I'm going to go and try and convince Dick I'm not in the middle of the most epic polyamorous relationship."</p><p>"You go do that." Kon calls out, "I'm going to use your shower because I like your water pressure best."</p><p>"It's the exact same – <em>whatever</em>. I'm out."</p><p>-</p><p>"I am bleeding." Cass announces and Bart narrows his eyes.</p><p>"But it isn't your cycle yet."</p><p>Cass ruffles his hair, kicks Tim's chair and then grabs him before he can flail to the floor and break his face on something.</p><p>"I'm bleeding from a battle wound and we're out of bandages, because a certain boy wonder here is shit at restocking."</p><p>"I'm sorry I was bleeding out at the time." Tim says, blinking himself awake as he slowly settles on the table, face pillowed on his arms, "I don't remember things very well when I'm delirious from blood loss. I'll do my best to fix that."</p><p>"Someone please run to the store and get me bandages. By someone I mean Bart, because Bart is clearly the only one awake."</p><p>"Where's Kon?" Bart asks, Cassie snorts.</p><p>"Milking cows." She fishes Tim's wallet out of his pocket and hands Bart a twenty. "Buy a lot. Like, a ridiculous amount of a lot."</p><p>"Where are you bleeding from anyway?"</p><p>Cassie lifts her leg up and points to a gash at the back of her thigh. Bart winces in sympathy before running off.</p><p>"I don't even want to know how you got that and why you're only just mentioning this now." Tim says, eyes drifting closed.</p><p>"I kind of forgot about it." She says, running a hand through his hair. "It was a late night and you know how things go when you party with Oracle."</p><p>"No, I don't know, because only idiots party with Oracle in non-gaming situations." Tim snorts, "How are you not hung over?"</p><p>"I'm a goddess among mortals." Cassie deadpans. "And the next time you call me an idiot I'm going to let you fall and break your face. Again."</p><p>-</p><p>"This is why we told you it was a bad idea." Bart says as Kon narrows his eyes at his lack of a wardrobe. "You run through those things like – like – "</p><p>"Like toilet paper."</p><p>"Like tampons."</p><p>"Like batteries."</p><p>"Like – "</p><p>"Okay, guys, I get it. Bad idea to use civilian standard clothing for a costume. But I swear I had at least five more of these shirts."</p><p>"Are you accounting for the one that got singed last week?" Tim asks, "The one you lost because of the robots with lasers?"</p><p>"What about the one that almost got torn apart by the giant underwater sea monsters?" Bart pitches in.</p><p>"Don't forget the one you ripped during sparring practice with Kara." Cassie says.</p><p>"Okay maybe I run through them faster than I remember." Kon sighs, "But tights aren't really my thing."</p><p>Tim and Bart raise an eyebrow.</p><p>"No offense to the people in the room who do wear them!"</p><p>"Uh-<em>huh</em>."</p><p>"It's just not me." Kon runs a hand through his hair. "It doesn't fit my image."</p><p>"Your image of being a farm hand?"</p><p>"All American apple pie?"</p><p>"Teenage male model?"</p><p>"The boy next door?"</p><p>"Tasteless?"</p><p>Everyone turns to Bart. He shrugs. "I think you looked <em>cool</em> with your leather jacket and earing, Kon."</p><p>"Thanks, buddy." Kon and Bart exchange a fist bump.</p><p>"I have no input on any of this. I don't even know why I'm here." Tim says. Blinking slowly. "Pretty sure I was asleep."</p><p>"You're here as an example of bad costume choices." Cassie says, patting his knee. "You try, Tim, you do, but in the end you just look like a sad and lost child."</p><p>"I do <em>not</em>." Tim protests even as Bart makes a laughing face at him. "I am an <em>adult</em>. I pay <em>taxes</em>. I own the house we are currently living in. I pay our living expenses!"</p><p>"Shhh, lost child." Bart whispers, reaching around Cassie to stroke Tim's hair. "Shhhh."</p><p>"Anyway. I need clothes." Kon says, "And we need to figure out a material I can make t-shirts and jeans out of that isn't. So. You know. Break-able? Rip-able? Frail?"</p><p>"We?" Tim mutters, "This is a <em>we</em> problem?"</p><p>"Yes, Tim. We stick together in times of fashion crisis's." Bart says. "That's what friends <em>do</em>, you potato."</p>

    <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>“I need to borrow your biceps.” Tim says to Cassie and Cassie shoots a smug grin at Kon who just glares at the back of Tim’s head. “Not that yours aren’t impressive, Kon, but I need like. Quality over quantity right now.”</p></blockquote>

  <p>“Are you actually attempting to <em>mother me</em> from half a continent away?” Tim asks, staring incredulously at his phone as Kon continues to rattle things off at him.</p><p>“He’d do it in person but he’s behind on chores.” Bart says, dutifully writing down the things Kon is telling them to do. “He does it because he cares and because Cassie is too busy doing important things to deal with our boy-ness. Which is – frankly – a little insulting because he’s totally one of us helpless peons who depends on Cassie’s common sense to keep us going in a vaguely forward direction.”</p><p>“I am an <em>adult</em>.” Tim says, shoving the phone at Bart and returning to suiting up, “My actual <em>parents</em> didn’t parent me. I don’t need Kon and Cassie to do it <em>continents away</em>.”</p><p>Bart snorts, Tim glares.</p><p>“That wasn’t a joke?” Bart blinks. “Oops.”</p><p>Tim jabs a finger at Bart’s direction, “Don’t you start with me, <em>freeloader</em>.”</p><p>Bart shoots him the widest, wettest eyes that he never grew out of and Tim turns around because if he can’t see it, it doesn’t <em>count</em>.</p><p>“He’s ignoring me. Make him stop it.” Bart says into the phone, like both Kon and Bart aren’t like – <em>five</em> years old. Tim sometimes doesn’t know which is worse.</p><p>Dealing with his best friends or dealing with his <em>siblings</em>.</p><p>Jesus, it’s like picking one form of crazy over the other. And he <em>chose both</em>.</p><p>They say you can pick your friends but not your family but <em>Tim picked both and now he’s stuck with them and this is the result of that</em>.</p><p>“Kon wants to know if you took your multi-vitamin.”</p><p>Yes, he did, but just to be contrary Tim shrugs his shoulders, “Bart, I am a busy, busy vigilante slash fake crippled philanthropist. I don’t have time for <em>multivitamins</em>.”</p><p>He feels the slight displacement of air that they’ve drilled into Bart to use for politeness -</p><p>“He took it, I counted the pills.” Bart says into the phone, “Kon also wants to know if you’ve had a daily glass of milk. That’s from Ma, by the way. He’s just the guy asking.”</p><p>Tim breathes and stares at the fluorescent lights of his ceiling. Honestly, it’s almost as bad as when <em>Alfred</em> checks in on him. The only reason it’s not the same level of uncomfortable shame and embarrassment is because it is <em>Alfred</em>. And Alfred will always be a special level all on his own.</p><p>“Yes, Ma. I drank my daily glass of milk.” Tim says. And it’s partially a lie because he put milk in his coffee since he ran out of creamer and he figures that if you add up all the milk he put into all those cups of coffee he’s got at least one glass of milk going for him.</p><p>Bart snorts, “Liar, liar.” But he says yes, anyway, because Bart also knows how terrifying failing a check in from Ma Kent can be and he’s a good friend.</p><p>-</p><p>“It,” Kon says when he sees Cassie lying down with her face on Tim’s thighs, Tim’s hand rubbing slow circles on her back, “Is not your cycle yet, why are you watching terrible sitcoms with Tim’s thigh pillows?”</p><p>Tim glares at him and Kon moves to hover next to his girlfriend – only a little bit in arm’s reach because he’s learned his lesson the first ten times, thanks. He has a learning curve, <em>really</em>.</p><p>“Well. To <em>start with</em>.” Cassie says, voice slightly muffled by Tim’s thighs, “Sometimes people just <em>feel sad and it has nothing to do with their goddamn menstrual cycles</em>. You dick. Sometimes I just feel like sitcoms, alright? Get out of my <em>air</em>. You smell like <em>wildlife and sunlight</em>. Ugh.”</p><p>“And Tim generally smells like pollution and quarantine zones.” Kon says, eyebrows raising as Tim scowls in his direction, still rubbing circles on Cassie’s back. “Also we agreed that Tim’s thigh pillows are like – fair game for <em>everyone</em> and I totally called dibs earlier today.”</p><p>“They’re not thigh – “ Tim starts just as Bart zips in and says - “Hey no fair, I called dibs on the left thigh pillow.”</p><p>Tim raises his face to the ceiling and mouths something Kon doesn’t catch before attempting to pull himself out from underneath Cassie’s face.</p><p>Cassie snarls.</p><p>Tim stills and goes back to petting her back.</p><p>“On second thought you need them more.” Bart says, his own eyebrows raising as he leans over the back of the couch. “Hey, Cassie, I can go get the DVD set for <em>The Golden Girls</em> if you want? We can watch the one with the pig. That’s your favorite one, right?”</p><p>It is her favorite one. Cassie is strangely attached to the story of Baby the pig.</p><p>Kon goes to the kitchen and wonders if someone remembered to stock up on edible cookie dough or if he’s going to have to make some from scratch.</p><p>-</p><p>“I need to borrow your biceps.” Tim says to Cassie and Cassie shoots a smug grin at Kon who just glares at the back of Tim’s head. “Not that yours aren’t impressive, Kon, but I need like. Quality over quantity right now.”</p><p>Bart snorts and Kon turns to glare at him.</p><p>“I am so insulted right now.”</p><p>Cassie and Tim go down into Tim’s lab of dastardly and dubious plots, twinkling Christmas lights framing the sign and everything, leaving Kon to glare at their backs as Cassie flexes – walking backwards as she makes faces at him.</p><p>“They do it just because you make the funniest faces afterwards.” Bart says. “Kind of like you licked the rind of a grapefruit.”</p><p>Kon raises an eyebrow. “The rind of a grapefruit?”</p><p>“Kind of tastes like bitter soap.”</p><p>“So basically I look like I licked soap?”</p><p>“Only if the soap tastes like a rind of grapefruit.”</p><p>“<em>Which tastes like soap</em>?”</p><p>“You look like you licked the rind of a grapefruit.” Bart repeats, slowly, “Rinds of grapefruits taste like bitter soap. Bitter soap does not necessarily taste like the rind of a grapefruit unless it is specifically made to taste that way. It is not a two way street. You get me?”</p><p>“No. But thanks for trying anyway.” Kon sighs, “What does he even need biceps for? He’s got <em>two</em>. And they’re like – pretty terrifying for a normal human being his age. Like. His body is terrifying for a dude of his age. A mortal human of his age. Right up there. Way up there. One rung below Nightwing because what the fuck is even going on with his spinal chord at this point.”</p>

  <p>“There are easier ways to die.” Cassie says as Tim pinches the bridge of his nose. “Like, you don’t have to marathon yourself through a mountain of paperwork. It’d be faster to take cyanide. Or, I don’t know. This is your field of expertise, isn’t it? Like, that’s the Gotham expertise. Self-destruction and stuff. Terrible thing to specialize in, by the way. Seems really counter-productive. I’m just saying.”</p><p>“Could you talk a little quieter for me?” Tim mutters, slowly lowering his head onto the desk, pinching his fingers together. “Just a little. Do it for me.”</p><p>“Probably shouldn’t have taken those shots.” Cassie continues in normal volume, “I mean. Paperwork and all nighters and red bull is one thing. Adding shots of alcohol to that? Just prolonging the torture there.”</p><p>“The torture is that I let you in.” Tim pulls some books over his head. Cassie rolls her eyes.</p><p>“Please. As if you <em>let</em> me do anything. I got in on my own.” Cassie laughs. “You’re pathetic, Drake. Where’s the Robin I know and love? Dying over paperwork. That’s sad. I thought you’d go out choking on peanut butter in your boxers sitting on the kitchen counter.”</p><p>“You’re not helping.” Tim groans. “Every word out of your mouth is like a little pointy arrow to my brain.”</p><p>“I don’t even warrant spears? Insulting. I am so insulted.” Cassie ruffles his hair, dislodging the papers. “You need to sleep. I need you in tip top shape to wrestle the other two of us into reasonable submission. You’re the other half of the single voice of our logic.”</p><p>“I thought that was all you.”</p><p>“I’m the voice of logic, you’re the voice of logistics. They go together.” Cassie amends. “They counteract nicely with the other two of our foursome. Now as the voice of logic, I’m telling you to go to sleep. As the voice of logistics, I trust it’s up to you to tell me how to get you there.”</p><p>“Please don’t carry me over your shoulder. Your arm is like a rock and I’m pretty sure you could give me deep tissue bruising. Handle me like a delicate flower because in this state of hung-over sleep I am a corpse flower. The kind of flower you don’t fuck with because once every ten years it turns into a cesspit.”</p><p>“You’re smelling like one.” Cassie agrees. “So glad I don’t have super smell. Things must be so fucking shitty for Kon.”</p><p>“He lives on a farm, you think he’s grown used to it yet?”</p><p>“I’d hope so for his sake by now. Either that or he’s just stubborn. Which he is, but stubborn in a different way.” Tim snorts, before wincing. “Note to self, never do that again.”</p><p>“Try it, your sass tolerance wouldn’t let you. Come on, off up you go.” Cassie gets her arm under his shoulders, pinching his side, “To sleep in a vaguely horizontal position on that nest you call a bed.”</p><p>“A nest is technically a type of bed.”</p><p>“For birds, you dork.” Cassie snorts. “You’ve really got to get that whole <em>you’re not really a bird</em> thing figured out.”</p><p>“Of course I’m not a bird, I’m a boy.” Tim yawns, sleepily leaning against her, rubbing his head against her cheek.</p><p>“You’re a doof.” Cassie replies, gently floating them up and towards Tim’s room. “And because I care for you, I’m not going to stop Kon or Bart from barging in on you tomorrow and smothering you with sound. Think of it as a lesson as to why you shouldn’t drink like an idiot. Drink like the smart guy I know you are, instead.”</p><p>“Words of advice to live by.” Tim nods a bit, jaw cracking as he yawns. “Why is it that I suddenly feel more tired when I’m about to go to sleep, but I feel – like – totally okay while working aside from the major headache that’s threatening to give birth to the next Athena?”</p><p>“It’s your finely honed sense of self-destruction at work.”</p><p>-</p><p>“I did it better.” Kon says as Tim works on tying his tie and trying to figure out why it keeps turning out lopsided and weird looking.</p><p>“Tying ties?”</p><p>“No. The whole – “ Kon waves a hand, “Media darling thing. How come when I do it, it’s <em>no Kon, find your roots, find your chill.</em> When you do it, everyone’s like <em>oh my god, he’s so amazing and hot and his teeth are so white</em>. As if your teeth are even real at this point.”</p><p>“I’m insulted, at least one of these bad boys is still mine. The rest are perfectly sculpted to look like they were their predecessors.” Tim replies. “I paid good money for these teeth.”</p><p>Kon snorts, batting Tim’s hands away to fix his tie. “You bought your looks.”</p><p>“But I come by my roguish charm honestly.” Tim fires back. “Or at least, it was trained into me honestly. Can that even be honest if it’s trained? Whatever, someone had to have started with something, right? So it wasn’t like I was a blank slate to work with, there was a bit of genius inside. Anyway, the point is that I might have bought these teeth but that doesn’t mean there’s anything wrong with them.”</p><p>“You are ridiculous. I don’t know why I ever thought you were all <em>I am the night, Darkness, Law, Vigilance.”</em></p><p>“To be fair, Bruce tried very, very hard to make it so but that little curl of rebellion inside of me just wouldn’t straighten out.” Tim sighs as he pulls at his suit jacket. “Besides, half the reason why I do the media darling thing better than you is that it’s a family business.”</p><p>“It’s a family business for me too.”</p><p>“Yeah, your family <em>is</em> the media, and mine is <em>darling</em>.”</p><p>Kon attempts a swat at Tim’s head. “Your family owns the media. Your Dad signs Clark’s paycheck.”</p><p>Tim rolls his eyes. “We don’t actually <em>own</em> the media. Just piece of it, Kon. Pieces of it.”</p><p>“And all of those pieces just happen to agree that you’re such a charming young man.” Kon pinches Tim’s cheek with his TTK and dodges the retaliatory punch. “I’m just saying that there’s a double standard here.”</p><p>“Or maybe I pulled it off better than you did.” Tim shrugs. “Maybe I am that more charming than you.”</p><p>“<em>Please</em>.” Kon rolls his eyes, stepping back and brushing Tim’s shoulders with his knuckles. “If my brand were still going strong it’d kick your brand’s ass so hard.”</p>
