</p><p>There are few that would call him a <em>barbarian</em> to his face. Fewer now, than even before he became the King's consort and entered the seclusion of the Consort's Garden.</p><p>He is aware of what these soft aristocrats and merchants of the South think of his people in the North. Tim doesn't particularly care one way or the other.</p><p>(There is a reason why the Empire of the Immortal King has never turned their armies onto the mountain fortresses of the North.)</p><p>"You can't sleep here, consort." Cass says, her black and gold armor startling against the glittering mosaic tiles of the Consort's Gallery. "You'll burn."</p><p>Tim drags a finger across the mirror-still surface of the water. He feels his vision start to blur – to slip, and it would be tempting to cause trouble. Just to see what his <em>king</em> would do. Better yet – what the fools the King calls <em>advisors</em> would do. Tim's lip curls -</p><p>"The North does not burn." Tim replies, but drags himself up anyway, the many layers of gold and silk are so <em>bothersome</em>. Tim thinks that this is why Jason didn't actually believe him when he first said that he was going to become the King's consort.</p><p>("Not even <em>Bruce</em> can deal with being the Princess' consort half the time. Not even <em>Selina</em> or <em>Shiva</em> can deal with it. They spend half the time running away or in other countries for the sole purpose of avoiding the duties of being her consorts. You wouldn't last a <em>day</em> as the King's consort."</p><p>"It can't be so bad. If I'm consort no one can tell me what to do – honestly I don't know why I didn't think of this earlier."</p><p>"You're unbelievable. I don't even know why we're blood brothers."</p><p>"Because barbarians have to stick together?")</p><p>Cass shrugs, slipping back into the shadows as Tim retreats back into the safety of the Gallery's walls. He could <em>probably</em> slip her notice and escape the Garden if he tried hard enough. Cass would eventually find him – probably. Or she'd let him have his way. It's so hard to tell with her.</p><p>Or she'd tell on him to Jason, and then his brother would yell at him for a few hours. Tim wrinkles his nose, collapsing onto the rugs and pillows around the main room of the Gallery.</p><p>"I'm so <em>bored</em>." Tim complains.</p><p>"It's either this or attending counsel to serve Ra's." Cass points out, folding herself down in front of him and jabbing him with her boot. She cocks an eyebrow, "You <em>could</em> always terrify some supplicants."</p><p>Tim rolls onto his back. "I want to go to the markets."</p><p>"You can't. The King has forbidden it." Cass replies. "You keep freeing slaves. And killing thieves. You give the city guards too much work while taking it away. Jason should be back from his trip in a week."</p><p>Tim runs a hand through his hair, and it's been so many years since he's seen the white and gray landscape of his homeland, but he can't help but miss it in times like these.</p><p>"I'm bored." Tim repeats. Cass ignores him in favor of sharpening her hidden blade.</p><p>The gold at his wrists chimes, and the bells around his ankles seem to taunt him.</p><p>Tim closes his eyes and <em>waits</em>.</p><p>-</p><p>The people of the North are not the same as the people of the Immortal King's empire. To those Southerners, they are barbarians. Pale skinned, cold to the touch, red-eyed, horned, and savage. They have no king, no cities, no nobles. There are only clusters of fighters and hunters who've fought each other into submission and claimed the title of <em>jarl</em>.</p><p>Tim's mother was the <em>jarl</em> of their stead. She had killed her womb-brothers and womb-sisters, and seized the stead with her own two hands. Then she took Tim's father as her blood-bound. Their stead wasn't very large and it wasn't on very good land. But it was ripe with powerful bounties and many people from other steads would come and seek protection under their roof to hunt these monsters and claim their hides.</p><p>Mother had slain a frost-drake. Its skeleton had hung over their feast-hall and its leather was part of mother's greaves and boots. As the song goes – mother had brought it into submission on an ice-floe and plunged her entire arm into its eye socket. She came back to the stead soaked in steaming drake's blood and hauling the carcass behind her.</p><p>Father had slaughtered a deep-dweller. He was crossing the ice when it grabbed him from underneath and dragged him below. It was a miracle he didn't drown. Its scales were crushed and mixed into the paint that wrote the runes above their doors and windows.</p><p>It all burned when Tim was eight. Tim's not sure if there's anything of his mother's stead left.</p><p>When Tim was eight, raiders from the south came. To the southerners, they are barbarians. <em>Animals</em>.</p><p>White skin and red sclera. Horns and a language not their own. Fangs and claws.</p><p><em>Uncivilized</em>.</p><p>The raiders burn his mother's stead, and use their Southern magic against them.</p><p>Tim didn't know it – not until he's dragged into the Imperial City, beaten bloody, branded, and bound in lengths of enchanted chains – but the Southerner's magic is vastly different than the kind bred by his people.</p><p>It comes with words and it summons blasts of energy and it creates large invisible shields between ice and lightning and vulnerable flesh.</p><p>Tim watched his mother shriek her rage to the sky, calling upon magic that isn't hers to wield – her body breaking and deforming with the burden of it – even as she ripped men down with her. He watched his father thrash against his bonds before getting his head cleaved off.</p><p>Tim watched as they skin his mother and father. As they took their horns. Some of the other children are bound and chained. Slaves. They will be taken to be sold off at the Southerner's trade posts. Tim had heard stories of his fellow frost-children being kept like hawks and dogs and cattle. For decoration and for fucking and for fighting.</p><p>They are <em>wargeld</em>. War prizes. It is a word that Tim knows is not <em>theirs</em>. When the <em>jarls</em> fight for land and over kills and over blood and honor they do not take more than what they originally set forth. It is <em>dishonorable</em>. It is wrong. When the fight is over it is over and there is never a winner. Just a victor, a conqueror, a <em>jarl. </em></p><p>And this is not war, and Tim is <em>no one's prize</em>.</p><p>He watched as his mother and father's blood-bound-brothers-and-sisters fall. One by one.</p><p>Tim watched and when they turned to him he struck.</p><p>They eventually did take him with them.</p><p>But when he entered the King's city, he did not enter as a slave to be sold. He entered as a murderer to be hung, and Tim couldn't help but laugh for that.</p><p>-</p><p>"Inefficient." Tim says as Ra's attempts to guide him through another spell. "Your magic is inefficient."</p><p>The word is new to him. It's a Southern word. There isn't one like it in Tim's tongue.</p><p>Ra's sighs, "If you are to control my armies, it would help for you to at least know what they are capable of."</p><p>"Raping and pillaging. Aside from that nothing useful." Tim replies.</p><p>He is seventeen and freshly promoted to commander of the King's armies. He has been a soldier for nine years, and they have yet to beat his spirit out of him. They tried. They failed. He thinks that maybe Ra's is a little proud at that.</p><p>The Southerners rely too much on steel. Their weapons are easy to break and their forms are too stiff to be practical. Tim understands them, and he's found amusement in the curved dual blades. The staffs remind him of the heavier ones back north. Bows and arrows are fine, even if there aren't any here he can use his full strength with.</p><p>But Tim much prefers the power of his own hands and feet, the thrum of the Earth's energy braided with his own.</p><p>If the powers that be had intended for sticks and steel to be so powerful, they wouldn't have made lightning and frost.</p><p>Tim shifts underneath the King's gaze. He won't be able to leave and spar with Jason until he at least <em>tries</em> what the man wants.</p><p>In the nine years he's spent here, he's learned the basics of this strange magic. This strange <em>bastardization</em> of the Earth's energy.</p><p>These Southerners – they use words to bend and break magic into form. They conjure fire by breaking the Earth's energy and they form ice by crudely bringing it back together. They create shields by haphazardly gathering them into place and they create blasts of energy by recklessly diverting the energy in the air.</p><p>It is <em>inefficient</em>. It is <em>disgusting</em>. And above all it is <em>disgraceful</em>.</p><p>But, Tim thinks as he tries to do what Ra's asks of him, he supposes that they cannot help it. The are Southerners and they cannot see as he can.</p><p>They do not know how to fear the world.</p><p>Ra's' hands are warm and – not unpleasant – strong as he holds Tim's wrists steady and guides him through the spell again.</p><p>The man seems pleased enough when Tim conjures a small ball of light. Tim wrinkles his nose and shifts again, angling his body towards the windows. Ra's sighs.</p><p>"When will you outgrow your impatience, savage one?" Ra's says letting go of one of Tim's wrists to brush his fingers against Tim's cheek.</p><p>That is another thing that Tim has learned. These southerners are very <em>affectionate</em>. (Another Southern word.)</p><p>"May I go?" Tim says. Nine years and the words still sound strange on his tongue. He <em>feels</em> strange in this borrowed form that Ra's has made him swear to wear, wherever he goes.</p><p>Blue on white instead of blue on red, no horns, peach-pink-pale skin, dull teeth, and crescent moon nails.</p><p>Ra's sighs and lets go of Tim's wrist, waving him away. "Try not to land on any nobles."</p><p>Tim flashes his teeth as he braces one foot on the windowsill.</p><p>"Their fault that they don't look up." Tim doesn't wait to see the look of exasperation that is undoubtedly on the King's face and <em>jumps</em>.</p><p>(It is not the same as the memories of the Northern gales he clings to so desperately, but that brief moment of air rushing past his ears is just enough to make his heart ache.)</p><p>-</p><p>Jason is a half-breed. He is half frost-child of the north, and half of something from the country where the Princess' first consort resides. Something from the west. Jason says that he was not brought low by the southerners, and Tim isn't sure if he believes him.</p><p>But he is the only other frost-child in this forsaken city of gold and sand, and Tim cannot be picky.</p><p>All things considered, Jason is a good ally to have. He is strong, he is taller than Tim. Tim isn't sure if Jason, too, was also made to wear a southern skin, or if this is how he really looks. But Jason is the one who coaches him through the discomfort of changing his form and having his powers locked away.</p><p>Jason is the one who teaches him to fight like a Southerner, teaches him their language and their strange customs.</p><p>Tim is the one who teaches Jason about the North and about the endless spires of ice and stone that pierce the sky. The ice-bears with their glowing blue eyes and their towering frames. The frost drakes that can be anywhere at anytime, in the deep black of mountain soil to the pale white of fresh snow. The large thunderbirds with feathers that <em>screech, click, rustle</em> like broken glass and wingspan greater than two full grown men. The crescent stags with their pale white antlers and their slate-gray hides, their cousins the aurels with their sharp black prongs and their midnight hides and bellows that can make even a full grown tundra direwolf think twice.</p><p>Tim teaches Jason the ways of the land they lost, and Jason teaches Tim the ways of the land they lost it to.</p><p>"I used to live in the west." Jason says as they do morning chores. Tim doesn't mind morning chores, they're easier than the things he used to do back at his mother's stead. he doesn't understand why the other soldiers in training complain so much. "The first consort of the princess is my guardian. He was the lord of Gotham before she claimed him and brought him here."</p><p>Tim's seen the princess' first consort – of which, she has many – and he is a very large, intimidating man. Broad shoulders and a severe looking face. Bruce, Tim remembers him being called, the princess' looming shadow. He has never heard the man speak. He doesn't match the air of a consort. He wears none of the finery that the princess' other consorts wear, and he often goes around in leather and light armor. He is always armed.</p><p>"Like a father?" Tim asks, and he wonders if that makes Jason prince – Jason shakes his head.</p><p>"Not in the way you're thinking. He's not my sire. There's no flesh shared between me and the throne-line." Jason says, "He has another ward – Dick. But Dick's from somewhere far East that I've never heard of. Travelers. When Bruce became consort we both came here with him. I enlisted to join the King's army because it was either that or sit around on my ass all day and look pretty."</p><p>"You'd be terrible at it, you barely look decent when you're freshly cleaned." Tim says, ducks the swat Jason aims at his head.</p><p>"Brat." Jason mutters.</p><p>Before Jason was Bruce's ward, he was a street urchin. As far as Tim understands, <em>street urchin</em> is something like the <em>unnamed</em> back in the North. No sire, no dam, no blood-claim, no stead, no title, no honor. Unwanted. They usually die. Throwing themselves off of cliffs or taunting something into killing them. They rot. Or get scavenged.</p><p>There is no pyre, no ceremony, for an unnamed.</p><p>Tim swallows back acid at the thought. Because <em>he</em> is an unclaimed, now. Branded a slave and again as a murderer by the laws of the South.</p><p>But there is Jason, he thinks. And he thinks that if he were to die here, in this forsaken land, that maybe Jason would light a flame for him to guide his spirit home.</p><p>-</p><p>Tim wrinkles his nose as Ra's guides him into the dungeons. He is not unfamiliar with the network of tunnels and stone that run beneath the palace – after all, he did spend a few days lingering here before the King gave his ultimatum – but it is his first time in this particular branch of tunnels.</p><p>"You show promise." The man says, Tim eyes him warily. As much as he thinks that the man's armies are pathetically weak and helpless, he knows enough legends of this man to know that <em>he</em> is not.</p><p>They tell horror stories of this man to children in the North. Tim remembers them almost fondly.</p><p>"When you first came here, you were beaten but not broken." The King continues to say, leading them down a spiral staircase carved into the stone. Tim can smell the faint scent of something acrid. Burning. "You were eight, were you not?"</p><p>"Yes." Tim replies. Eight years old, half-delusional from the pain and infection of the brands, and ready to die.</p><p>The King hums, "Eight years old and you killed half a squadron of raiders before they got you down. You killed another few dozen on the way back to my empire. Impressive. How do you suppose a situation such as that would play out, now that you are grown and trained?" The man glances at Tim over his shoulder.</p><p>Tim considers lying. But he isn't nearly fool enough to do so, not so <em>blatantly</em> in front of the King.</p><p>"You raised me under your roof until I grew strong, and then taught me the tactics of my captors and how to best use them as my own." Tim says. "I think that if I wanted to I could have the raiders broken under my heel."</p><p>"Good." The man says, and if Tim were in his true skin he thinks that his skin would be frosting in defense right now. "And how would you break them?"</p><p>"Completely."</p><p>Tim sees the flash of the King's smile before his attention is drawn to large, heavy wooden doors painted in runes at the bottom of the stairs.</p><p>"You show promise." The King says, placing a hand on the door. Tim shifts his weight onto his heels – and even cut off from magic as he is in this form, he can still feel the gathering of it, the electric crackle that causes the runes to glow. "You are young, and still untried. But I believe you to be worthy. This is the secret of my royal line, are you prepared to see it?"</p><p>Tim does not nod, doesn't hardly dare <em>breathe</em>, but the King is already pushing the door open.</p><p>It reeks of burning flesh, of rot, and sand and damp -</p><p>And for the first time in eight years, when Tim breathes, the wind howls<em>.</em></p><p>-</p><p>"In the Consort's Garden, there is no one who can disobey me. Not even the King." Tim says, "What makes you think that you are so special?"</p><p>"I am a <em>prince</em>." Damian hisses.</p><p>"And I am the King's first, and only consort." Tim raises his eyes to the boy's. Once he was known as the King's blade. The King's Barbarian. The winter-beast of the throne. Now he is the High Consort of the Realm. "Have the Princess' consorts been so neglect in your upbringing that you forget which of us is the superior in this situation?"</p><p>Damian flushes red and Tim almost feels bad for being so cruel. But the boy must learn manners and it is bad enough that the idiots of the court have forgotten Tim's many titles, but he will not be talked down to or underestimated by the Prince, as well.</p><p>Tim holds out a hand to the boy – he is twelve now, going on thirteen, and Tim has officially been consort for two years. It should not be enough time for the boy to forget, but time is different for children. – who takes it without question.</p><p>His hands are still small and smooth, calloused but not yet broken and scarred like they will be.</p><p>Tim brushes his hand over Damian's furrowed brow.</p><p>"I am not a treasure to be defended and gazed upon." Tim says, cupping the boy's cheek. There is so much of the Princess in him. But he can see touches of Bruce and Ra's, too. "And I am not <em>wargeld</em> to be pitied and pampered. I do not need you to fight my battles for me."</p><p>"Then why do you not <em>fight</em> these battles instead of hiding in your quarters?" Damian snaps, "It is shameful to hear the things they say of you. To hear the way they speak of you. You are the <em>High Consort</em>."</p><p>Tim wonders what <em>exactly</em> they say about him in court.</p><p>"I do not care what they say because they are wrong and beneath my attention." Tim says. "I will fight the battles I think are worth fighting, but I won't waste my time or energy with those flies. And I won't have <em>you</em> doing it either. There is a reason why they only say those things behind my back rather than to my face."</p><p>-</p><p>"The High Consort is so beautiful." Tim hears as he navigates his way through various servants and nobles. Ra's is speaking with some nobles visiting from one of the more distant cities. There are rumors of that city housing rebels, people who want to throw Ra's and his line off the throne.</p><p>Which Ra's knows, which is why he called those nobles here.</p><p>(And Ra's knows because Tim told him. And Tim knows because he is no fool. And he is no <em>wargeld</em>.)</p><p>The sound of bells is annoying, but familiar – a steady weight against his ankles as he draws closer to Ra's side. Nobles and servants alike clear way for him. Tim is no stranger to their split opinions on him.</p><p>Some are afraid of him, suspicious and cowed into rumors. Those are the ones that flinch at the sound of his bells and back away. And there are others who – much like him – are transplants from their countries, or aware of his more <em>clandestine</em> functions who respect him and, strangely enough, <em>love</em> him. Those are the ones that turn and bow, their hands pressed together in the shape of the flame these people revere. They, too, start rumors.</p><p>But Tim tends to find that half those rumors are in jest of the prior sort's fears and tend to bolster his reputation in his favor.</p><p>Tim folds himself at Ra's side, settling in a heap of brocade and gold as he deftly sweeps his sleeves aside to pour Ra's a drink.</p><p>The bindings on his magic aren't as strict as they used to be, and Ra's has always known that given a sliver he'd take the whole lot, so it really shouldn't surprise the man when he chills the saucer with his fingertips before raising it to the man's lips.</p><p>He gives the man credit, though, he doesn't flinch at the cold or show any other sign of surprise. His hand rests on the top of Tim's thigh and Tim feels the slow-burn of magic prickling his skin through the layers of cloth. Warning.</p><p>Tim pours more wine.</p>

</p><p>Tim is entering the fall of his fourteenth year when Jason pulls him aside during mid-morning drills, "There are Northerners at the gates of the city."</p><p>"So?" It is uncommon for people of the North to be seen in the Empire, but not so uncommon during this time of year. They are still free-trading countries, after all. And Tim has known of a few fellow frost-children who would venture South to claim unknown fame by slaying the strange beasts of the sand-wastes and emerald-jungles.</p><p>"They are <em>looking for you</em>." Jason says, pulling Tim into the palace and towards the private quarters of the royal family.</p><p>Tim is unsure of how Jason managed to explain the significance of <em>blood-brothers</em> to these people – Jason has told him that there is no equivalent that he knows of in the Southern languages – but ever since they exchanged blood Tim has been treated as Jason's brother. Tim is never barred from wherever Jason goes.</p><p>(He thinks there might be an equivalent in the language of Jason's country. Or something close. Because Jason explains it to Bruce, and it is Bruce who explains it to the Princess and the King.)</p><p>Something like hope slams into Tim's chest, and his magic swells against the constraints wrapped around him. He can almost taste the energy again -</p><p>"Are you <em>sure</em>?"</p><p>- and he can feel <em>dread</em> pooling in his stomach. If Jason is right, and they are looking for him – he doesn't want to go.</p><p>For the past six years, he has missed his home and the cold and the howling wind and the echoing ice, but if he left now he would be leaving Jason behind.</p><p>Unacceptable for blood-brothers.</p><p>"I'm sure. They mentioned you by <em>name</em>. They knew <em>when</em> you left the North, too." Jason says, hand squeezing Tim's wrist as they hurry towards Talia's war-room. "They'll be here soon. The King gave them leave to see you. I think he's <em>curious</em>." Jason spits the word out and his speech dissolves into the strange drawl-cut of the Western countries. He speaks too fast for Tim to understand – but he catches swear words and the word <em>annoying</em> and <em>old goat</em>.</p><p>It is not often that he is in such close quarters with the royal family, and usually when he is eyes are not on him. It is almost disconcerting. It is mostly uncomfortable.</p><p>Tim kneels next to Jason the the beautifully embroidered cushions in front of the King and his children. Bruce is a large, comforting presence on his other side. Shiva and Selina sit on either side of the Princess, and Selina reaches over to brush her fingers against his head. Dick and Cassandra aren't here.</p><p>"Do you know anyone who would come for you?" Talia asks him. The King watches him, and Tim forces himself to look away.</p><p>"No." The entire stead was slaughtered by the Obeah Man. And the Obeah Man was killed by Tim. All of his parents blood-bound, the families of the blood-bound. Even the womb-brothers and womb-sisters, the flesh-bound were killed. Tim even saw a few of the unnamed that tend to linger around the gates of the stead being dragged away by the horns. Tim's stomach churns.</p><p>"There are two of them." Bruce says, Tim raises the eyes to the man. "A man and a girl – they wear the guise of Southerners. The man is missing his right eye. The girl is missing her left. They wear armor made of scales and carry swords."</p><p>Tim looks into Bruce's face and can see no lies – but – "Are you <em>certain</em>?"</p><p>It is impossible – and Tim wonders if it's even fair of him to <em>hope</em>.</p><p>"Yes." The King speaks for the first time, "I believe that the man is called the <em>Terminator</em>, in our tongue. Deathstroke, in yours."</p><p>"And the girl is the <em>Ravager</em>." Tim breathes, hands fisting on the top of his thighs. Tim breathes and wishes for his magic. "They are here? In the city?"</p><p>"Yes – who are they?" Shiva asks, leaning forward. "They are known even in the East. Why do they come hunting on your trail?"</p><p>"Not hunting." Tim says, "<em>Tracking</em>." Tim wants to stand, to run, to <em>meet them</em>. "I would see them, if the King permits it."</p><p>It stings to have to ask <em>permission</em> to see them. But he is not fool enough to risk his neck by making demands in front of the royal family. His ties to them are nebulous at best.</p><p>(They do not understand <em>blood</em>. Only <em>flesh</em> and <em>womb</em>.)</p><p>"I will speak with him first." The King says, "Then we shall see."</p><p>If Tim had his magic, he'd force the issue. But he does not have his magic – he does not have the blessings of the Earth, and his gift has been stolen from him.</p><p>He is a boy at fourteen, with only Jason as his blood, and nothing else.</p><p>He bows his head and thanks the man who has given him life and taken it away.</p><p>-</p><p>"How did you survive?" Bruce asks him, as he follows the man like a shadow. He has exchanged a handful of words with the Princess' first consort, and Jason's guardian. The man is intimidating. He reminds Tim of his mother. It aches.</p><p>"Barely." Tim replies, holding still as Bruce puts another book on the stack in his arms. Bruce is one of the King's tacticians. Not in name, of course, but in the privacy of closed doors he speaks to the King freely. Or so Tim has heard. He wonders what it means that the King would rather lend ear to the words from the Princess' consorts than his own advisors. "I hid in the snow using my gift, but they dragged me out when there was no one else left to kill. There was a man with strange dolls – he would prick them and set them on fire. And it would happen to the others. He had a staff of many feathers and a very short dagger." Tim remembers the man well.</p><p>The man's blood is on his hands, after all.</p><p>Tim remembers – and the words tumble from his mouth in this foreign, and <em>soft</em>, tongue like an avalanche.</p><p>"I felt the <em>hamask</em> come upon me." Tim had always known that there was <em>berserkr</em> flesh in him. From his father's flesh. "And the Earth entered me, and I swallowed the gift. I became <em>hamrammr</em>. And I was all things. And I devoured and I ravaged. I was blessed by the mother-dragon and the sister-<em>huglr</em> of our land. And when it was over the father-wolf called me home, and mother-bear pushed me back into my own flesh and it was over." At the time, Tim had thought vendetta was completed.</p><p>He has many vendettas, now.</p><p>It is a sensation he will never forget. The rage and sorrow building in his bones, the <em>fear</em>. And when the<em> hamask</em> came upon him it felt as if the world was falling away. His veins had opened up to the Earth, and she was kind to him. He could see everything, and he knew all things. He had felt the sorrow of the trees that had watched over him since he was a babe in his mother's womb, and he felt the rage of the stone that were the hallways of his mother's stead. The sky above howled and he howled with it, and the air steamed when blood was spilt and there was magic in everything.</p><p>Tim will never forget that.</p><p>When he looks up, Bruce is pale and his jaw is clenched. What happens next is very odd – because as much as the people here touch and embrace, Bruce does not.</p><p>But he kneels down – for he is a large man, and if he had any flesh of the north in him Tim thinks the man could've been part <em>ettin</em> – and he slowly pulls Tim into his arms.</p><p>He says something in his own tongue, the one that Jason has been painstakingly trying to drill into Tim's head.</p><p>Later, Tim will learn that Bruce is saying <em>I am sorry</em>.</p><p>But a few hours from then, Tim will learn that the man Tim killed was a raider by the name of Obeah Man. And Bruce had been charged by the King with hunting the man to bring him forward for cruelty and black magic. And he had failed, lost the trail when Obeah Man went towards the North.</p><p>It is from that moment on that Bruce talks with Tim more. As not just a strange creature who has grown attached to his ward, but as a person.</p><p>And later, Tim will realize that it was from that point that he caught the King's true interest.</p><p>-</p><p>Tim waits alone in one of the small sitting rooms overlooking one of the enclosed gardens. He is nervous – he isn't sure if he wants it to be true or not. That his mother's blood-brother was alive, that he came for <em>Tim</em>.</p><p>The door opens, and Tim's head snaps up to see who enters. The man and woman in scale and fur do not look like the man he grew up with, or the girl he remembers. But he probably doesn't look like the boy they remember either. Not in these soft-southern skins.</p><p>But it is <em>them</em>, without question. Tim half rises and Slade and Rose meet him partway.</p><p>They grasp at each other and with his face pressed against the hard scale and fur of their armor he can almost <em>remember</em>. The touch of his mother's hand on his face, his father's heartbeat underneath his ear.</p><p>They fall to the ground and Tim pushes back to watch, to take them in, and burn them into his memory.</p><p>Slade's hands frame his face, looking back into him.</p><p>Both Rose and Slade have kept their white hair, unique in their true forms and just as unique among the gilded south.</p><p>"It is done." Slade says, "My sister's stead is burned to the ground. There is nothing but stone and snow, left. They are gone."</p><p>Tim breathes, and a knot he didn't realize was in his chest dissolves. No neighboring stead would have ransacked a stead raided by Southerners. It's dishonorable, and disrespectful to the unhonored dead. It would evoke the vengeful spirits and it would call forward the wrath of the Earth.</p><p>He had been afraid that no one would burn the land and that the spirits of the dead would be forced to linger and warp the area.</p><p>He is relieved that he was wrong.</p><p>Slade and Rose sit back, and begin the ritual for a tale. It is wrong, it is all wrong. They should not be in these false skins for this, and the thick carpeting on the floor separates them from the stone and earth. Bound as he is, Tim can't use his magic either. But they make do with what they have -</p><p>And they begin to sing-chant-weave the word-shape-images of how they were returning from a skirmish on the border. They had brought down three aurels in the night, and a string of rabbit on their way back. They ran into the raiders on their way and fought to the stead. But by the time they got there, it was nothing but blood and viscera.</p><p>They had burned and honored each body they could. Neighboring <em>jarls</em> had come out to help and to mourn.</p><p>Tim feels his eyes burn with salt, and Slade hauls him into his lap and cradles him against him like Tim is still a babe with his milk-teeth. Slade's voice is deep and steady as he sings of the pain and the rage, the sorrow of burning his blood-sister and her blood-bound, but being unable to find his blood-son. Rose's voice joins in, and through his tears Tim sees his expression of sorrow mirrored onto her. She grips his ankles and her forehead presses against his knees as she sing-sobs about the horror that his mother's body had turned into, and the blood-soaked snow and stone.</p><p>He sees the shine of blood on stone and he smells the ash as they set it all ablaze.</p><p>They sing-chant-weave the image of the entire stead going up into flames. The billows of smoke and the rising voices of their fellow frost-children as they mourn this loss to the South.</p><p>Rose sings about the pain of watching her blood-mother and her blood-mother's blood-bound without their horns and missing their flesh and the horrors of what had been done to the corpses. She sings about the fear of losing Tim to such a fate, or a worse one.</p><p>They sing about the long and angry nights of tracking. The hope, the single thread of possibility that the brother and sister-raven bless them with. Rose weaves the flight of the Twin-Ravens and the visions they blessed her with that caused them to look towards the Empire of the Immortal King.</p><p>Tim tastes the first rush of heat as they leave the North and plunge into the emerald and topaz of the land, one cluster of Southerners at a time until they find him in the Imperial City.</p><p>By the time they finish weaving their tale, Tim is done crying. And bound as he is, he cannot weave the tale properly for them to see-feel-hear. But his hands can still make the signs and he can try to compensate with his voice.</p><p>Tim sings about the <em>hamask</em> that had came upon him. He sings about his mother hiding pushing him into the snow, and how he had frozen it around him and <em>watched</em>. How the Obeah Man and his raiders flung magic and steel against his fellows and how they butchered the bodies. He sings about how they found him, and how the Obeah Man had dragged him out of the frost kicking and screaming.</p><p>He sings about the <em>rage</em> at seeing his mother and father brought so low. The disgrace inflicted upon them. The spite and refusal to become as they had. He sings about the gift that entered his body and the power he had felt.</p><p>Tim sings about the brand – the first one that marked him a slave to the South. He had fought, and it had gone wrong. The mark did not heal properly, and the image is blurred and distorted. He sings about the pain and delirium, and how that had brought on his second <em>hamask</em>.</p><p>That <em>hamask</em> had gone wrong, as well. It was uncontrollable, and he felt the fury of the horned-ones crash through his bones and his skin split and crack like the frost and stone giants that haunt chasms with their moans and howls.</p><p>He sings the pain of his second brand, the brand of a murderer. And the pride he had felt and the shock of being cut off from his magic, the Earth.</p><p>When his voice falters, Rose and Slade's voices hum and push him back into speech.</p><p>He sings about his imprisonment, the ultimatum from the King. His hands flash the signs for blood-brother as he sings about Jason, and how Bruce took him under his wing upon learning about the Obeah Man. Tim sings about Selina and Shiva. He sings about Dick and the strange customs of the South. How he will never play and hide and doze among the pelts and furs in the storeroom of his mother's stead, and the taste of fresh kill. How he misses the ability to see, to taste, to hear, to feel properly. He sings about how the winter is never cold enough and how the skies are always blue. Tim sings about the strange swords and steel they forge and the new words he's forced to learn each day.</p><p>Tim chants out the hollow and empty dread that he is losing his home, himself, a little bit more every day.</p><p>He sings about the hope he felt upon hearing that they had came, and he sings about his fear for the future. With his palms and fingers, he beats out the rhythm of his days and his heart and when he finishes he feels wrung out. Refreshed.</p><p>Rose kisses him when he is done, her hand hard and and familiar on the nape of his neck.</p><p>"You've done well, my father's blood-son." She says. And she holds her other hand between them, fists it and pushes against his chest. "Blood-brother."</p><p>It is all wrong. But time is not on their side.</p><p>Rose and Slade share blood with him without the shield of the night, right there in that sitting room of t his sun-baked and sky-kissed country. And Tim feels a little less alone.</p><p>-</p><p>When Tim is sixteen, he is called to the King's war-room. And he is told that he is a strong candidate to become the head of the King's armies.</p><p>After that, Tim spends a lot of time in close quarters with the King. With Ra's.</p><p>The man treats him well, and all things considered, Tim doesn't mind him.</p><p>"Do you hate this country?" Ra's asks him, as Tim looks over maps of the border territories. Tim looks up at him. He must be nearing fifty, perhaps sixty. But for a man of his age he still gives off the air of someone in their prime.</p><p>"No." Tim replies. And he does not hate the South. He does not understand countries.</p><p>It had taken him a long time to learn the ways of these people.</p><p>"But this country frustrates me." Tim says, earning a raised eyebrow. Tim shifts in his seat, looking back down at the map. There are few maps in the north, because there is no need for them. Everyone knows where everyone is, and where everything is. <em>Those</em> are the forests where the aurels hunt at night, <em>that</em> is the cliff where the neighboring <em>jarl's</em> flesh-sister lost her life to a mother dire-wolf. This is the lake that <em>jarl</em> Janet-Drake-Slayer shares with <em>jarl</em>-Farr-fifth-flesh-son-of-Gunther-<em>Barskr. </em>This is the mountain you must climb in order to reach the roosts of the thunderbirds, and on the side that releases-the-sun is where the <em>ettin</em> carve their homes. Two hunting-runs from that mountain is the next stead.</p><p>Ra's waits for Tim to continue -</p><p>"You people make simple the things that are not. And make the things that are simple difficult." Like <em>blood</em> and <em>flesh</em> and <em>womb</em>. They say <em>aunts, </em>and <em>uncles</em>. They say grandfather and grandmother, sir, and lady, miss and mistress, lord and consort and king and noble and dozens upon dozens of words that Tim has never heard of.</p><p>And then there are the physical divides. There is a kingdom with provinces and then cities and villages, which are different from estates. Then there are districts within cities and blocks and streets and rooms and it's an endless list of names for <em>house</em>.</p><p>People are divided by wealth – coin. There is no coin in the north, either. And when they are unhappy they stay unhappy. They do not fight, they do not leave, they do not go off on their own. It makes him want to throw his arms up in frustration.</p><p>"Inefficient." Tim says. There are so many words in this Southern language that he has had to learn. This is perhaps the only one that he likes, just because it has so much <em>use</em>.</p><p>The language of the South is soft. Soft syllables and sighing sounds that would be ripped from the mouth in the wind. It is not a strong language, no strong sounds. It is a quiet language. And depending on the speaker it can be beautiful – but most of the time, Tim finds that he is annoyed with the way sentences come out.</p><p>The tutors have often told him that his words are too harsh. That his speech is unrefined, impolite.</p><p>The King doesn't seem to mind. And so Tim will speak as he always has.</p><p>"You divide the people and then they get upset and revolt. What is the point in that? They hate you behind your back then try to kill you. Your armies squabble with each other because of it. Your nobles have done nothing to prove their honor. They are soft and fat and wouldn't last a second against a <em>child</em> in battle. They rely on empty words and have empty heads." Tim frowns, "Too many things have different names when only one will suffice, and things with one name deserve more. Your soldiers fight in drills and only drills. They spar with the wooden toys only a child would use. And the raiders are out of control and cause trouble for your people and others. They have not been brought to heel."</p><p>The King smiles, and reaches across the table to rest his hand against the side of Tim's neck.</p><p>Tim wrinkles his nose, and carefully pushes the man's hand off.</p><p>"And your people touch too much." Tim concludes. Ra's raises an eyebrow.</p><p>"But you do not hate it." He says.</p><p>Tim frowns, "Is that all you got out of that? No. I do not hate your people."</p><p>"Even though the raiders are my people?"</p><p>"The raiders do not bow to you, and therefore they are not your people." Tim snorts. "And why would I hate the raiders? What have the raiders done to me?" Tim has long repaid the ones who dragged him out of the ice and threw him into the sand. He has no quarrel with the rest of them as long as they stay out of his way.</p><p>"Oho." Ra's says, leaning his cheek against his knuckles. "You have a strange way of thinking."</p><p>No, Tim thinks, <em>you do</em>. You and your crazy country that thinks flesh is the end all be all and little bits of glittering metal are worth food and shelter.</p><p>"Well. You are not wrong." Tim says, eventually. Ra's laughs.</p><p>It is a very nice laugh.</p><p>(The pit of Tim's belly feels warm and his curls his hands into fists over the map. It is not unpleasant. <em>He</em> is not unpleasant.)</p><p>"Tell me, is that interesting way of thinking the reason why you do not do as you are told to do?" Ra's continues. The amusement in his voice rankles. "Even I, as unversed as I am in the way of you northerners, know that you teach your young to respect their elders."</p><p>"The elders have earned the respect we give them." Tim snaps. "The are not fat, arrogant, lazy <em>pricks </em>who sit on their asses and presume to know what is right at all times."</p><p>"Ah, but I am an old man who sits on a throne and makes small talk with supplicants all day long. And yet you listen to me." Ra's says, leaning forward, "All of your teachers and trainers have had to come to me personally on an almost daily basis in order to get you to do anything."</p><p>Tim narrows his eyes. "To you I may seem a simple-minded barbarian and slave, but I am not so stupid as to believe that you are <em>just</em> an old man."</p><p>Ra's hums, eyes glittering as he leans back. "No, simple-minded you are not. A barbarian, yes, but simple minded, no."</p><p>You are worthy, goes unspoken.</p><p>Who is the not-speaker and who is the not-listener is debatable.</p><p>-</p><p>There are many stories about his blood-father lost his eye. He has heard many of them, and it amuses him to know that several have made their way to the Southern countries in their untarnished form.</p><p>"You never said that the Terminator is your uncle." Jason says, at the private dinner. Tim shrugs.</p><p>"He is my mother blood-brother." He says.</p><p>Slade declared that he and Rose would stay and train Tim in the art of the <em>hamask</em>, until his gift was perfected and under control. They had wanted to take Tim back to the north for this training, but Ra's had refused it.</p><p>"He is one of my most promising soldiers." Ra's had said, looking at Tim as he spoke, "And favored apprentice to many, he cannot leave in the midst of his training."</p><p>The other boys in the barracks ask him about it.</p><p>There are many stories.</p><p>Some say that his blood-bound was of the <em>huldrefolke</em> and that he had underestimated her, and slighted her grievously. To show her prowess and to regain the honor lost by his disrespect, she had challenged him to combat and taken his eye.</p><p>Another story says that he took it out, himself, and dropped it into the well of <em>Ymir</em> in exchange for power. And he was rewarded with the gift of battle-growth and he would never suffer a mortal wound again.</p><p>(That is not true, Tim knows that for certain. It is through the powerful control of his <em>hamask</em> that Slade is able to instantly heal any wound and fight for hours upon hours on end.)</p><p>Mother used to snort and laugh at those stories, then draw him close and tell him that Slade had lost his eye when he was a mere frostling and hurt himself in sparring.</p><p>Father would laugh and say <em>no, that's not possible because he still had that eye when he became your blood.</em> Father said that Slade lost his eye fighting a bounty too strong for his gift to win against.</p><p>Tim is unsure of which of these stories is true. But he does know how <em>Rose</em> lost her eye.</p><p>She is four years older than him, and when she was ten she went to the well of <em>Ymir</em> and traded her eye for a gift of knowledge. In return for her eye, the Twin-Ravens came to her and blessed her with visions.</p><p>"I am glad you are here." Tim says in between bites and polite conversation. Rose bumps their knees together.</p><p>"I am glad that you are alive and unbroken." She replies. "The song of the Earth and frost is still in you. Blood-mother and her blood-bound would be proud of you."</p>

</p><p>It rankles to have to learn the art of the <em>hamask</em> in front of so many strangers. But it feels good, when the King curls his hands around Tim's wrists and undoes the bindings that have held back the winter gales in his veins and the frost on his skin. Tim breathes, and feels the southern skin slipping off of him. His horns crest and his skin frosts. Tim flexes his hands, his arms, and turns towards Slade and Rose.</p><p>They, too, have shifted forms, and Rose knocks her horns against his, purring with contentment when she feels the magic that has been trapped within him re-enter the world.</p><p>(Refreshing. It's refreshing. The magic has been stagnant within him for so long. Searching for a way out, trying to reconnect to the Earth. And now it's <em>free</em>. Tim is <em>free</em>.)</p><p>They are in the royal training grounds – with the King and the King's guard keeping watch over them. It bothers him, and he's not sure why. At first he thought it was because it felt <em>wrong</em> to practice this sacred ritual in front of foreigners. But when Tim thinks about it, he really doesn't care <em>who</em> watches. It's more that the King is watching and the suspicion that he would turn his horns upon the man that has his life in his hands. Tim is not so foolish, or so fickle. He agreed to fight for this man, he is no oath-breaker. He will not turn his horns onto the King who has done him no wrong.</p><p>Especially not when there is more than just his neck on the line.</p><p>("If we were in the North," Slade muses stroking his beard, contemplative look upon his features, "Perhaps I could fight him to a draw. If we were in the North. But, no. I would not fight him here. If I could help it, I would never want to cross the Immortal King.")</p><p>The blood of <em>besrkrs</em> runs strong in Slade's blood. And of all the frost-born, Slade and Rose are perhaps the most blessed by the gift of the <em>hamask</em>. It is rare for a frost-born to undergo the <em>hamask</em>. Rarer still to bend the <em>hamask</em> to your will.</p><p>Slade's <em>hamask</em> gave him the battle spirit of the deep-dweller who's scales he wears on his armor. Battle-growth. And it is the gift of the wind-shriek that gives him his speed and accuracy. Rose's <em>hamask</em> is also the deep-dweller's battle-growth, but it is not nearly as strong as Slades, and is often  overshadowed by the visions she's gained from giving her eye to <em>Ymir</em>.</p><p>They have stripped down to their trousers, and Rose looks like she wants to undo her breast-bindings but leaves them on for the sake of the southerners.</p><p>(These strange Southerners with their layers of <em>silks</em> and cotton and endless jewelry.)</p><p>Tim knocks horns with her again, before turning to Uncle who gestures them both into crouches.</p><p>"When you became <em>hamrammr</em> for the first time, blood-son, who came to you?" Slade asks, and for a moment the words are unwieldy on Tim's tongue – so long speaking in the Southern ways, it takes a moment to remember how to <em>speak</em> -</p><p>"I was sheltered and carried on the mother-dragon's wings, and the sister-hulgr threw drew me out of my blood." Tim replies, making the signs with his hands and calling their images forward, "But it is Father-wolf who calls me home to the mother-bear who pushes me into frost-flesh again."</p><p>Slade nods, and they begin.</p><p>-</p><p>The revolt happens a year into Tim's promotion to being the Commander of the King's Armies, and gaining the title of the King's Sword. He is eighteen, and the youngest Commander in the Immortal King's history.</p><p>They are attending a poetry reading in one of the several gardens of the Imperial city. There are many people - servants, slaves, nobles, and merchants alike. No one is allowed to carry arms into the city gardens, and there is no reason to suspect violence here.</p><p>Tim doesn't understand what's going on until it is too late, and the attackers are upon them.</p><p>The entire event falls apart, and people are running, screaming, fighting, and dying all over the place.</p><p>Tim loses Ra's in the swarm of colors and motion – "Guards!" Tim snarls, "<em>Guards!"</em></p><p>And like complete and total <em>idiots</em> the guards swarm around <em>him</em> instead -</p><p>"Not <em>me</em> you fools! The <em>King!</em> Protect the <em>King!" </em>Tim has to fight to get out. The guards hold him back, and it is then that Tim realizes that half the guards are <em>fighting each other</em>. It is not a random attack.</p><p>Dread pools in Tim's stomach along with anger, and if he had access to his magic, his gifts, he would show them all the true wrath of the North.</p><p>In all honesty, it would not be difficult for Tim to fight on his own. Even unarmed as he is, and without access to his magic, he is more than capable of dealing with threats of this level on his own. He has trained for over a decade with Shiva, Bruce, Cassandra, and the other soldiers. The King has personally seen to his combat skills, and they spar almost every morning. It should not be difficult at all.</p><p>Hell, even the King should have no need of assistance. But there are too many people – and Tim would rather not strike down some hapless and innocent servant trying to escape instead of a genuine attacker.</p><p>There are too many people – all of them moving and screaming and snarling, coming towards him and away from him, swimming in and out of his vision - and Tim cannot tell the difference between ally and foe. Not when merchants are pulling knives out of their robes and turning on servants, and when slaves are beating guards, and when guards are slitting their fellow's throats.</p><p>Anxiety makes his heart race, as he tries to find the signature green of the royal house -</p><p>He finally manages to catch sight of the King through the throngs of people, and starts to head towards him when the unthinkable happens.</p><p>Tim sees a sword pierce the King's chest from behind, and Tim's mind blanks for a moment. A moment of sheer <em>horror</em> and <em>surprise</em> and <em>rage</em> that makes his vision blur. It is strong enough that he feels the <em>hamask</em> rise in him. And for a split second, Tim thinks that his magic has gotten so great it's snapped his bonds. He watches the King sink down, hand pressed against his wound, a snarl twisting his lips.</p><p>A cry builds in his throat, angry and sharp – and before his lungs can draw the breath necessary to pierce the stillness of the moment -</p><p>Steel pierces through Tim's own flesh.</p><p>-</p><p>"You are not unattractive in this form." Ra's says, running his thumb over the ridge of one of Tim's horns. He cannot feel it, the touch is too light. Too gentle. Tim shifts his weight and resists the urge to look away. He lets out a breath, tasting the frost on his lips before licking it away. The King looks fond as his fingertips move to brush against the base of his horns. Tim shivers and drops his eyes to Ra's' throat.</p><p>Ra's looks so very <em>pleased</em> with him. And Tim <em>feels</em> good, feels <em>proud</em> for that. To have gained Ra's' pleasure. To have <em>caused</em> it.</p><p>And why would he not be proud?</p><p>Tim has mastered his <em>hamrammr</em> and <em>hamask</em> quickly. The lightning of the mother-dragon is second nature to him, just as easy to call as the frost and the winter gales. And the predator-stalk the sister-huldr graces him with is good enough to startle even Slade. He brings honor to the <em>beserkr</em> name, and with that he brings honor to his house.</p><p>Slade is now teaching him how to tap into the gifts of the <em>hamrammr</em> without fully entering the state of <em>hamask</em>. It is hard work, to still tap into the mother-dragon's heartbeat and the sister-huldr's breath when he is fighting back the <em>hamask</em>. But it was rewarding, when he first called lightning between his fingertips without the mother-dragon first drawing him out of his body. And the first time he silences his presence in his southern-form Ra's had looked at him with such pride that Tim had lost his concentration.</p><p>(If they were in the North, Tim would be hunting a she-dragon for a token of its favor, and seeking out one of the huldrfolk to win a token from their tree. But it is not, and Tim will make do with what he can find when he sneaks off of the castle grounds.)</p><p>There is no longer any reason for Ra's to remove the bindings that keep him in this southern skin.</p><p>But the King frees him for a few hours a day, anyway. The feel of Ra's' skin is familiar to him in both forms and strangely welcome. Warm and calming in his Southern skin, and hot and exciting in his frost.</p><p>"Thank you." Tim replies, and for a moment he feels caught. Then Tim remembers that he is supposed to be training and slips away from him, giving the man his back.</p><p>Whenever Tim trains, he feels the King's eyes on him. But whenever he looks the king is always looking elsewhere. At the notes that he brings with him to study, at whatever book he's in the middle of, the sky – always something else.</p><p><em>Look at me</em>, Tim can't help but think, sometimes. <em>Let me see you</em>.</p><p>There is a part of him that wants to try his magic against the King's. The King is said to have mastered the power of the eternal flame which can burn through all things. Through <em>time</em>, even. He wants to see the powers of the man who is called the Immortal King, and the Demon's Head.</p><p>He would most likely lose. Tim is certain. Perhaps he would even be killed in the process.</p><p>But <em>oh</em>, it would be the most beautiful and honorable way to die.</p><p>(He was granted life by those hands. Death at any other's would be unacceptable.)</p><p>-</p><p>It surprises Tim that this man knows his language. He speaks it well, and it makes him both homesick and angry. He has <em>no right</em> to speak in his language.</p><p>"You could be hung for murder." The man that Tim knows is the <em>jarl</em> of this place says. The King, if Tim understands the fervid whispers well enough. "Or you could join my army. There are many like you who rise through the ranks quickly. You have seven days to decide. Do you want to live, or die?"</p><p>Tim doesn't need those seven days – he's been in this cage for what he thinks is three nights already. And Tim is not sure what an <em>army</em> is. But Tim knows that he wants to live, and perhaps whatever an <em>army</em> is will be better than being a slave. Perhaps he'll even be able to escape.</p><p>"I want to live." Tim says, and looks into the man's green-gray eyes. The man smiles and Tim wants nothing more than to rip that smile off his face and <em>eat it</em>.</p><p>"Then perhaps you are not as hopeless as rumors would have you barbarians seem."</p><p>-</p><p>As soon as he agrees to enter the King's army, he's taken away to be washed and dressed and fed. It is not until Tim meets Jason that he realizes how <em>unusual</em> it was. How – how perhaps his fate and his ties to the royal family were decided from the very beginning.</p><p>He is taken to a large and beautiful bathing chamber – a rainbow of colored tiles and steam rising from the large pool in the center of the room -, and a beautiful woman with short hair and green eyes helps him bathe. She points to bottles and tells him their names, and mimes how to use them. When she sees the mess of the brands on his back, she hisses and fusses over them.</p><p>There is no helping the brand that marks him a slave, it is a mess beyond repair. But she puts a strange smelling poultice on the second one. It is cool and feels so good.</p><p>She has him sit in front of her on the rainbow-tiles and she washes his hair. Her hands are strong and deft, and it feels so <em>good</em> to have all the grime come off. The blood and dirt and filth.</p><p>Some other people come in, at one point, and they exchange panicked words that Tim doesn't understand. Their voices are high and frantic, but the woman just waves them away with a handful of calm words in their direction. He thinks she must be important.</p><p>She coaxes him into rinsing his hair, and then brings him clothes to dress. She trims his hair until it is short – cutting of knots and tangles. He feels a little like a sheep.</p><p>Tim's heart aches for his mother. Her hands running through his hair, running over his horns and the smell of her as she brushes her hair. The warmth of her lap as she lets him crawl over her and fall asleep on her bed. The softness of her skin as she rubs his back after a nightmare or when he's sick.</p><p>Tim bites his cheek hard, and there is no time to cry. He shouldn't cry. Not here, not now.</p><p>But he misses her so much. He misses <em>her</em> and he misses his father. He misses his <em>home</em> that is gone and taken from him.</p><p>The woman puts the scissors down and wraps her arms around him. She says something in this strange language of the South that he doesn't understand. But her voice makes him think of his mother, with how soft and warm it is. So Tim cries, he cries and he screams and it echoes throughout the tiled room. She holds him and rocks him against her soft chest, and her arms are strong as he sobs.</p><p>He sobs because his parents will know no pyre, and he wasn't able to burn their desecrated bodies to give them peace. He cries because he'll never play in the feast hall again, and he'll never sit on his mother's blood-kin's knees and listen to their stories. He'll never get to join a hunting party and he'll never have his coming of age ceremonies. Tim will not bring fame to his mother's stead, and he will not bring honor to their blood-kin.</p><p>Mother will never kiss him and father will never toss him into the air. He will never see his blood-kin again.</p><p>Tim cries because he won't see the frost and lightning, and he's lost his magic, and the brother-sister-mother-father-Earth-spirits have abandoned him.</p><p>The woman holds him through it all.</p><p>(He hopes that he sees her again.)</p><p>-</p><p>"If you permit it, I would court you." Ra's says, when Tim is about to stand to fetch their afternoon meal. His hands are warm against Tim's arms, and with both of them seated on the floor like this – Ra's cross legged, and Tim rising onto his knees – Tim has to look down. Has to look down and <em>into</em> him. Ra's thumbs graze over Tim's knuckles and Tim feels so -</p><p>The surprise he faces here is almost the same as the shock of the raiders hitting his mother's stead, the smell of his own flesh burning, Slade and Rose coming for him, his first <em>hamask - </em></p><p>But <em>oh</em>, it is so much more electric. It blindsides him and leaves him dumb, mind blank, and heart hiccupping in confusion. Tim feels heat burn his skin, inner heat.</p><p>Tim blinks, mouth open and he sits back down. Ra's still holds his wrists in his hands.</p><p>Ra's recent resurrection has made him much younger. The years literally burned off of him, and the smell is something Tim doesn't think he will ever forget.</p><p>Even before his revival, Tim had grudgingly admitted to himself that the man was <em>handsome</em>. Regal. Dignified. Even with the streaks of silver and the signs of age that lined his face.</p><p>All of that has melted away, and Ra's has left the Imperial City to recover from the Lazarus Pit's effects.</p><p>"I – " Tim blinks. "Court me?"</p><p>"Yes. If you would allow me to." Ra's says, drawing small circles over Tim's knuckles with his thumbs. Tim could break the hold, if he wanted to. He could laugh in the man's face – for he is not King at the moment. Talia reigns from the Imperial city while Ra's recovers, and Tim is not bound to this man in anyway -</p><p>"And what would that mean?" Tim asks, mind slowly wrapping around the words that came out of Ra's' mouth. "To be courted by you?"</p><p>"You could become the High Consort." Ra's says. And Tim knows what <em>that</em> means. "You would no longer be my commander, of course."</p><p>Tim would be trading one position of power for the other. Tim looks at their hands and thinks.</p><p>He has no hope of going back to the North. No hope of becoming a <em>jarl</em> and building his stead, or claiming a name. He is blood-bound to Jason and Cassandra. He cannot leave them here and go where they cannot follow. He has built too much, here. He has his allies among the common folk, and he has gained so much respect from the soldiers and servants. He has made <em>connections</em>. It would be a waste, to abandon that and go back to the North to start all over again.</p><p>He has grown <em>fond</em> of the the royal family, as well. Selina is very much like a second mother, Bruce a second father. It would pain him to leave Dick behind.</p><p>And has he not worked hard to survive here? To climb his way to the top of the King's army? Is it not the same as what his mother did? Is he not, in his own way a <em>jarl</em>, here in this land of deserts and rain?</p><p>But to exchange that for consort -</p><p><em>High Consort</em> -</p><p>Tim's fingers curl and twitch against Ra's skin.</p><p>If he were to become high consort, he would not have the same power as he does now. The consorts are respected, yes. And it is true that they are above all others, save the King. But it is also true that they are powerless. They have no <em>true</em> authority, no <em>true</em> station. He would no longer be in command of the army, he would not have leave to tell them one thing or another.</p><p>Any power he would have must be that which he carves and takes for himself. It is a path he will walk alone.</p><p>But – then again. The High Consort rules over the Consort's Garden. And is that not a stead of its own? And sitting with the ear of the King – would that not make the entire <em>country</em> his stead? Would he not be the <em>jarl</em> of a great many, if he became the High Consort?</p><p>"If you wish to court me," Tim says, raising his eyes from their hands to Ra's face, "Then you may only court me. I will be the only one you court, and I will be your only Consort. There will be no first, or second, or third. I will not <em>share</em>." Tim digs his nails into Ra's skin, and straightens his shoulders.</p><p>He cannot be a <em>jarl</em> in the north. But he will be a <em>jarl</em> in the south. And all will be <em>his</em>.</p><p>Ra's smiles and pulls Tim down to him – "But of course, what do you think of me, my barbarian, that I would court another when I already have you to please? Any man would be hard pressed to satisfy you <em>and</em> find the energy to seek out another."</p><p>-</p><p>Tim wakes up in a room he is unfamiliar with. He feels dizzy, and on fire. His magic feels <em>wrong</em>. Conflicted. It keeps surging, as if fighting with something, like it's trying to force something out – or break the bindings.</p><p>He feels disoriented, and when he sits up there are bandages around his torso. He remembers being stabbed, but – but the pain should be more than this, right? It should hurt more. How long was he unconscious?</p><p>The King -</p><p>"Calm." Bruce's voice says, and Tim turns too fast, feels his flesh twist and <em>scream</em> – Tim coughs. Gags. The air smells rotten. Bruce rests a hand on Tim's shoulder, and he feels <em>hot</em>. Fevered – "Calm down."</p><p>"The King – " Tim rasps out – "What happened to the – "</p><p>"Wounded. He wishes to speak with you." Bruce says, "Can you stand?"</p><p>"Yes. What happened?"</p><p>"A revolt." Bruce says, "Ra's will explain it to you."</p><p>-</p><p>"Where are you going?" Jason asks, as Tim descends down the stairs towards the exit of the Consort's Gallery.</p><p>"To the King." Tim replies. Jason lets out a strangled noise -</p><p>"At this hour?" Tim cuts his blood-brother a sharp look. "What <em>for</em>?"</p><p>"A cup of tea and a little chatter. What do you <em>think</em>? I'm going to sleep with him." Tim snorts. Jason covers his eyes with his hand and groans. Tim rolls his eyes, "I am his <em>consort</em>. What did you <em>think</em> I was going to do?"</p><p>"You can't just walk around the palace grounds dressed like that." Jason says.</p><p>Tim would rather walk around in this than the numerous jewels and bangles and layers of silk and brocade that he has to tolerate daily.</p><p>"Why, are you frightened that I will catch a <em>chill</em>?"</p><p>"Half the new servants think the halls are haunted because they keep finding frost and puddles." Jason says, "Does the King know you slip your Southern skin at night like this?"</p><p>"Seeing as we fuck like this I think it would be hard for him to <em>miss</em>." Tim replies, "Go to sleep, Jason."</p><p>"I am your <em>guard</em>. I'm not going to sleep until <em>you</em> go to sleep." Jason sighs, "I'll escort you through the private tunnels – "</p><p>"For the love of – I am the <em>High Consort</em>. I have a <em>right</em> to be in the King's chambers. I have a right to walk the halls as I please. No one is going to try to assassinate me or bar my entry, Jason. I can take care of myself. And I don't need you to hold my hand like I'm a lost child."</p><p>"That's not the point – I just. Why are you so <em>stubborn</em>?" Jason glares at him, "You make this guard thing very <em>hard</em>, you know."</p><p>-</p><p>The wound the King has suffered is grievous. Even with the aide of magic, it is crippling and has left the King in great pain. Tim follows behind him as the man slowly, carefully rises. He does not offer his help, it is not his place. Ra's is his <em>jarl</em>, his elder – and he will not demean the man by offering help that he has not asked for.</p><p>"You are blameless." Ra's says, as he throws his cloak over his shoulders.</p><p>"They wanted to place me on the throne." Tim says, "They tried to kill you in my name." And I was <em>blind</em> to this scheming. "And when I did not cooperate they tried to subdue <em>me</em> and blame it upon <em>you</em>."</p><p>Chaos had erupted in that garden. Royal guards had turned on each other, and in the confusion it was impossible to tell who was on who's side. Jason killed the one who stabbed Tim, and brought him back to the palace. Ubu had arrived to take the King back as well.</p><p>The Rebellion has been put down, but both Ra's and Tim are wounded. Tim's nails dig into the soft flesh of his palms. And this mess is on <em>his</em> shoulders. If – if he had seen it sooner -</p><p>"You are blameless." Ra's repeats. "Come."</p><p>Tim follows the man into the stone hallway, and towards the stairs. They descend into the depths of the castle.</p><p>When Ra's opens the great wooden doors, Tim's magic <em>breaks</em> against his bindings – and for the first time in years, he feels his magic activate without his permission. It takes over him, the power of the Earth and frost crashing over his body and through his veins like thunder. There is something <em>powerful</em> beyond the threshold of this door. Something <em>old</em>, something <em>primal</em>.</p><p>Something like the well of <em>Ymir</em> – something alive, something uncontrollable and utterly overwhelming.</p><p>Ra's lets his cloak slide off his shoulders, and Tim is paralyzed as the man smiles at him – eyes glowing the same poisonous green as the room beyond him -</p><p>"Feel honored, barbarian. There are not many who can say that they have seen the secrets to the house al Ghul."</p><p>Tim watches Ra's walk into the water – old and scarred and tired – and emerge young, new, and hale.</p><p>And he bows.</p><p>-</p><p>"It is shameful to see one of us brought so low." The man spits, and Tim sighs eyes sliding off of him towards where Jason is signing for him to not make a mess. "Your mother was one of our great names, one of the greatest <em>jarls</em>. And here you are, playing bitch to the leader of these southern fools."</p><p>Thus far, into his two years as High Consort, he has been told this by many. Frost-children from the north who have come following rumors of his fall and ascent, both of great and no-name. Some come to simply speak with him, some urge him to return to the North. Some come to duel him, to defeat him, as if he were some bounty for them to add to their titles.</p><p>"You know," Tim sighs when the man pauses to catch his breath, "I came to meet you because it is always good for me to see one of my kind. There are not many of us, true Northerners, here. And, really, honestly I feel <em>so</em> attacked right now." Tim smiles, and allows part of his true face to slip past the Southern skin –</p><p>He feels his horns crest, breaking skin, and he doesn't think Ra's would be too upset with him for making a mess. After all, it was in <em>defense. </em>How could he allow such a slight?</p><p>Tim rises, and shrugs off the many layers he's forced to don every morning. He flicks the jewels and bangles off, lets them clatter to the ground. It feels good to be relieved of the weight and drag of the many layers. He's sure that Ra's or Selina would sigh at him for treating his finery so wrongly.</p><p>Magic flows through his veins, and his blood sparks with electricity.</p><p>It is not the same as the <em>hamask</em> – he does not need the <em>hamask</em> to win many fights, anymore.</p><p>He calls his magic to him, and the frost slams through the air -</p><p>"You are a <em>fool</em>." Tim hisses as he knocks horns with the man, "You are a <em>fool</em> to challenge me. You come to <em>my</em> stead. And you insult me to my face – and you have the balls to bare your fangs at <em>my</em> honor. Your horns are <em>mine</em>."</p><p>-</p>

</p><p>"Ah, I think I can guess who drew these." Ra's says, turning Tim's arm in his hand. His mouth curves up a he raises Tim's arm to his lips.</p><p>"Do they mean something?" Tim asks, head tilting as he tries to look at them from another angle. But no matter how he  looks at it, it's still just pleasantly arranged circles and swirls.</p><p>Ra's clicks his tongue, sighing as he traces the pads of his fingers over the lines that curve over his knuckles. The man shakes his head, laughs, Tim tries to pull his arm back -</p><p>"If you are just going to laugh at me, I will find someone who is willing to actually speak to me – "</p><p>"No." Ra's says, other arm curling around Tim's waist, "Ah, you see this is why I told you to pay attention to your lessons. But you did not listen, and now my daughter's second consort has written all over you because you didn't know better."</p><p>Selina <em>is</em> the one who painted the designs on Tim's skin this morning -</p><p>"She said that they are just <em>patterns</em>." Tim complains, "Traditional patterns, even."</p><p>The compromise was that if Tim would not wear the robes, the scarves, the shawls, or the jewels, he would sit still long enough for her to mark his skin with the plant-paste. No matter how much it itched or how much he wanted to move.</p><p>Ra's shoots him an indulgent look, and kisses his forehead. Tim wrinkles his nose and yanks his arm out of the man's hand.</p><p>"I think you are trying to pull one over me, to make me see things which are not there." Tim snaps, glaring at his skin.</p><p>"When you were first learning the magic of this land," Ra's patiently begins to explain, gently tugging at Tim's arm, "what was it your tutors told you?"</p><p>"To use my <em>words</em>." Tim mutters. "To enunciate. To stop glaring and get to work."</p><p>"And what <em>else</em>?" Ra's presses, Tim wrinkles his nose. "What <em>kind</em> of words?"</p><p>"Pretentious sounding ones?" Ra's clicks his tongue, Tim rolls his eyes. "Certain words in combination with others would produce special effects. And the intent behind the words could also effect the outcome of the magic."</p><p>"And what is the written form of these words?"</p><p>"Script." Tim recites, "Based on circles, which are the basis of the heavenly bodies that govern the natural laws of all things." Tim blinks, swears, "<em>What did she inscribe on me?</em>"</p><p>"Well. She was not wrong in saying that it is a traditional pattern." Ra's says, "It is a very old one, though. And I have not seen any wear it in many, many years." Ra's clicks his tongue again, shaking his head, "Ah. It pains me that my beloved one is so oblivious to the ways of my people."</p><p>"It pains <em>me</em> that my lord-husband's entire gods-be-damned family is fixated on driving me <em>insane</em>. What does it <em>say</em>?"</p><p>"As you know, much of our magic is based on magic and material." Ra's says, and Tim groans, slumping against Ra's side at what promises to be a very nice, boring, and utterly unnecessary <em>lesson</em>.</p><p>"I am not a <em>novice</em>, your lectures are unnecessary, you old <em>goat</em>."</p><p>"Your lack of knowledge betrays you. How you became my sword without knowing this astounds me. Hush. Listen, learn. As you in the North have your rituals, we too, have ours. We have tools that help us to harness magic, items and focuses."</p><p>"Innumerable trinkets."</p><p>"And how do these <em>trinkets</em> gain their power?"</p><p>"Through inscription of the holy words and heavenly seals." Tim mutters. Ra's hums, traces one of the circles on Tim's knuckles -</p><p>"And this is the seal of the heavenly vault - <em>an</em> . The morning sky. And this is the line that separates time and space - <em>zaman</em>." Ra's runs his thumb over the back of Tim's hand, "And these are the petals of the seasons. Ah, I should thank the Second Consort for her attention to detail. And these are the circles from which you can derive the <em>zaahir</em>. And she links the seals together, one turning into the other, an unbroken cycle."</p><p>"Yes, but what does it <em>mean</em>?" With Ra's pointing them out, Tim can see the seals.</p><p>"That I would know you in all your shapes, and all your forms." Ra's says, "And that you shall always return to my side. It is an old seal for <em>beloved one</em>. Spirit-sharer. Heart-holder."</p><p>Blood-bound, Tim thinks, beautiful and blood-bound.</p><p>-</p><p>"When you are blood you are bound." Tim says, "You have found each other, and you have tied your fates together."</p><p>In order to be bound, you must be recognized as fully grown. Usually that would be signaled by the completion of the coming of age ceremony. But there is no one to hold that ceremony for Tim or Jason in the South, and so Tim must make do with the spirit of the thing. The ceremony is based around the first kill.</p><p>You cannot take the blood of another without being willing to deal with the consequences of taking that life as your own.</p><p>And Tim has had blood on his hands since he was eight. So he waits for Jason, who at fifteen is part of the city guard.</p><p>When Jason wets his hands for the first time, Tim binds their fates together.</p><p>"You sure?" Jason says, palm in Tim's as Tim draws the runes onto his warm skin with the tip of his dagger. "I mean. This cannot be undone. I would rather you not regret this later."</p><p>"There is no word for <em>regret</em> in the North." Tim says. There are many things that there are no words for in the North. <em>Inefficient</em>. <em>Regret. Mistress. Sale. </em>"So, no. I will not regret this later."</p><p>-</p><p>"This is <em>unfair</em>." Tim says, and this is just one of the many words he is growing to learn. "How is this even training? You weigh the same as a water horse! You make yourself heavier on <em>purpose</em>."</p><p>"You calling me fat?" Jason says, practically sprawled over Tim's back as Tim attempts to lift him. "C'mon, where is that legendary strength of the North?"</p><p>I am two years younger than you, and you weigh heavier than boulders, Tim bites back, you are taller than me and you eat like a <em>wyrm</em>.</p><p>"Besides, it is hardly fair for <em>me</em>. I mean it isn't even hard to lift you. You weigh as light as a feather." Jason replies when Tim sets him down with a grunt, easily bending and lifting Tim towards the sky. "How is this supposed to make me stronger?"</p><p>-</p><p>The night after their wedding, Tim is escorted to the Consort's Garden. Bruce, as the Princess' First Consort had been the presiding lord over this strange place, but now that he is the High Consort it is his land.</p><p>In the Consort's Garden the High Consort has say over all. The servants and guards are hand picked and sworn to obey the High Consort, and only the High Consort. None may enter without the High Consort's invitation, and none may leave without the High Consort's consent.</p><p>All things within the Consort's Garden remain within the Consort's garden, everything is permitted.</p><p>If the High Consort – if <em>Tim</em> – wished it, the King would be barred from entering. Tim's word, Tim's will, is law in this place.</p><p>And it is a beautiful building. There are no walls to denote the boundary between the Consort's Garden and the King's, and the Consort's guards are dressed in gold and black. Jason follows a step behind him, his personal guard and Tim's voice in the world.</p><p>The buildings are white with beautiful tiles, and exotic flowers and trees in its inner courtyard. There's even a pond and waterfall.</p><p>The rugs on the floor are lavish, ornate and finely detailed with beautiful patterns and stitching, and the mosaics on the walls are so dazzling.</p><p>It is so very quiet.</p><p>"It is mine." Tim says, slowly turning around the second floor landing. Jason smiles at him.</p><p>"Yes, High Consort."</p><p>Tim stops his spin to look at Jason, "Blood-brother, this is where our real work begins, is it not?"</p><p>Jason's smile turns sharp, "Yes, blood-brother."</p><p>Tim laughs and throws his arms wide, the innumerable bangles and jewels he must wear on his arms clinking and chiming against each other. Tim watches the world change as his eyes shift – the particles of magic that flow through the air and swirl in all things coming to life before him – and tastes the frost in the air as his horns crest, "Shall we have some fun, then?"</p><p>-</p><p>"So <em>you're</em> the new little brother." Tim startles awake, hand flying out to strike at the person leaning above him. Something jabs him hard, in the shoulder, and Tim yelps when his arm goes numb, falling – "<em>Oh</em>. Sorry, sorry – I didn't – <em>reflex</em>. Here let me – " Fingers gently push against Tim's skin and guide Tim into sitting position. Tim blinks himself awake, turning -</p><p>The face is unfamiliar. But he wears the ring of the royal house, and Jason did say that Bruce's other ward would be coming back some time this week.</p><p>"Dick?" Tim says, and the man's features light up with joy -</p><p>"Ah! You know me?" Dick replies, beaming at him, Tim blinks at the stilted way Dick uses the Northern tongue, and the way he mixes it with Southern words – "Sorry, I don't get to use the Northern language very often. Do you understand the Imperial standard?"</p><p>"Parts." Tim says, yawning as Dick gently pulls him out of his cot. "Where are we going?"</p><p>"I want to talk to you. And everyone else is sleeping – come eat a meal with me?"</p><p>It is early, Tim thinks, glancing at the sky as he pulls on his boots, but not too early. He would be awake soon anyway.</p><p>"What about Jason?" Tim says, turning towards Jason's cot, only to find it empty.</p><p>"He went ahead to tell the cooks." Dick waves his hand. "Or warn them. I always eat a lot when I come back to the capital. Nothing tastes as good as food cooked at home, right?"</p><p>Tim blinks, and Dick falters -</p><p>"Ah. Well – fresh food is better than the rations I have on the road." He amends. Tim offers him a hesitant smile, that Dick returns in full. Tim thinks that Jason was right in saying that he is a bright man. A warm one. It is hard to be wary of him, when he smiles at Tim like that. Like he has known Tim forever and always. And the way he holds Tim's hand in his, lightly swinging their hands back and forth as they walk towards the kitchens -</p><p>"I am a trader and adventurer." Dick explains. "I travel a lot. Did Jason tell you? I am a nomad, one of the caravan folk." Dick throws his shoulders back and claps his free hand to his chest, "My clan's caravan would go as far as the <em>Beorn-jarl</em>'s stead, and then circle around the entire Immortal King's Empire<em>,</em> and we would hit all the Star cities of the Southern Islands and the Dark Continent of the West. We even went to the border-lands of the East. I was the one who taught Jason how to speak the Northern tongue."</p><p>And that explains why Jason speaks with an accent. <em>Jarl</em> Beorn's stead no longer belongs to the founding Beorn, but the tradition of the stead is for everyone to claim it to be called Beorn. It is perhaps one of the oldest steads, and lies in the nexus of the trade routes to the West.</p><p>Jason greets them from the kitchens, sleepy and yawning even as he pushes bread and fruit into Tim's hands and fusses over him like a mother ice-bear. Tim tolerates it, mostly because he finds it amusing and because the way Jason goes about it is as gruff and prickly as a pine tree.</p><p>Dick coos, and Jason punches him in the shoulder. But Dick just smiles and slings one arm around Jason's neck and launches into a long tale of his adventures and the people he has met and how much he has missed Jason and Bruce and Selina and Talia and everyone here.</p><p>By the time everyone else is awake, Dick has taken to calling Tim his little brother, and has wrangled a promise of keeping his free hours free so Dick can teach him how to tumble and jump and fly.</p><p>"He's like a <em>whirlwind</em>." Tim exclaims as he and Jason rush off to morning practice, Dick waving at them and wishing them luck from behind.</p><p>Jason laughs, hand curling around Tim's wrist as he tugs him forward, "I told you!"</p><p>-</p><p>Shiva was once an assassin, a bounty hunter, and the Princess' head guard. She is now the Third consort, and her daughter is as tied to the royal line as Jason. They share no blood with the line of al Ghul, but they are still prime candidates for the throne.</p><p>The woman is rarely in the Imperial City – in fact, none of the consorts, the Princess herself, are rarely in the city. They are often abroad, going through the other cities and lands under the Imperial name, settling conflicts and asserting the Immortal King's rule. Dick and Cassandra are older than Jason, and travel on their own as well.</p><p>Tim is uncertain of Cassandra at first. Both Jason and Dick speak highly of her as their sister. But she seems distant and difficult to him.</p><p>Cassandra is three years older than him, and rarely speaks. But she is highly skilled in combat.</p><p>"You fight differently." She says, "Not bad." She shrugs, "Not good."</p><p>Tim thinks that is a fair assessment. After all, he hasn't quite yet mastered the Southern styles of combat, and he had only just really started to get good at it in the North. But then again, he is fighting in a body that's still strange to him.</p><p>She tilts her head and gestures towards the royal family's private training quarters.</p><p>"You could be better."</p><p>Tim follows her, and even when she knocks him down as easy as breathing for the third seventh time in a row, he cannot really find it in himself to regret it.</p><p>-</p><p>Ra's is patient as Tim touches his fingers to his new, unbroken and unlined skin.</p><p>"You have tamed a <em>primeval</em> one." Tim whispers, unnerved and comforted at once by the sight of his true skin against Ra's'. "What have you – how have you – <em>what do you give</em>?"</p><p>"Do you have something like this in the North?" Ra's asks, and even his <em>voice</em> is different. Smoother, softer somehow. Tim swallows and presses his palm, flat over Ra's' chest. Ra's' heart is steady underneath his skin, and his skin burns to the touch. But he seems unaffected by the heat.</p><p>Tim can taste ancient magic in the air, can <em>see it</em> – see it <em>inside</em> of Ra's.</p><p>"This is the Lazarus Pit." Ra's says, "It is capable of bringing the dead to life, and of gifting those who enter its waters new youth, and new health. However that is only if it finds you worthy of its power."</p><p>"Is this – " Tim whispers, hands lifting to touch Ra's' face, to run over the smooth features and trace his bones – stops. Smacks him. "You absolute gods-be-damned <em>idiot</em>. This is why you are so <em>reckless</em>. Dragon-mother <em>help me</em> – this is why you are called the Immortal King!"</p><p>Ra's looks shocked, raising a hand to touch his cheek as Tim throws his hands up in the air and rants -</p><p>"Did you just strike your <em>King</em>?"</p><p>"Did you just <em>walk into a well of primeval power and come out a good half century younger? </em>Twin-Ravens grant me <em>patience</em>. You <em>fool</em>. Utter and incomprehensible <em>fool</em>. You would think that this is something you could tell me <em>before </em>I have a thrice-damned fit over you almost <em>dying</em>."</p><p>"I used the waters on you." Ra's says, and Tim startles, almost falling back when Ra's grabs his wrist and holds him up. "You had suffered a grievous wound, my barbarian. We were uncertain if it would work. Your magic is bound and you have the blood of the North in your veins – and even for the children of the South the fires of the Lazarus can be dangerous. But it worked on you."</p><p>Tim gapes, and he is certain he must look like some sort of fool -</p><p>"Are you upset with me?"</p><p>"Words cannot even begin to describe the things I want to do to you right now." Tim hisses. "But gods-be-damned, I am glad you are alive for me to do them to."</p><p>-</p><p>It is not the same as being blood-bound, Tim thinks as he waits in the King's chambers. <em>Their</em> chambers, now. The King's in name, theirs in spirit. It is not the same as being blood-bound, because there is no such thin in the South. It is not forever. It is not binding.</p><p>Tim thinks that to himself as he takes in the details of the ornate rugs on the floor, and the sound of the songbirds that nest in the King's garden. Tim walks over to the balcony, and if he squints he an see the glittering walls of the Consort's Garden emerging out of the greenery of the King's inner sanctum. A stead within a stead within a stead. He feels like he's being wrapped up into puzzles wrapped in riddles.</p><p>There have been many lovers to the King in the past, but only a few consorts, and ever only one at a time. And from those couplings there are many children born to the Immortal King. Though Tim has only met two, the third dead or in exile. No one has told him for sure, Ra's himself does not even know the whereabouts of his eldest daughter.</p><p>It is not forever. To be High Consort is not permanent.</p><p>It is not blood.</p><p>But – Tim shivers and curls his arms around himself.</p><p>It feels like it could be.</p><p>-</p>

</p><p>It is clear that Tim's tutors don't think much of him. To be fair to them, Tim does not make it easy for them to teach him, and he makes it a point to seal his lips shut and give the blankest looks possible whenever he is addressed directly.</p><p>Tim does not want to <em>learn</em>. He does not want to learn their flawed knowledge, their impossibly tangled way of speaking and their innumerable names for the most simple of terms. He does not want to know how they bastardize the magic and spirits of the North, and he does not want to know their stories of the horned <em>barbarians</em> that occupy the mountains.</p><p>He does not want to know their soft sounding words, and their gentle curving script. Nor does he particularly need to – which he proves time and time again.</p><p>"He is stunted. Damaged. Addled." His tutor says, dragging him by the arm to the King's chambers. Tim glares at him, and the King, at the glittering gold <em>everything</em>, at the thick carpet that is between him and the blessed stone, and even at the King's guards. The tutor raises a fist towards Tim's head and Tim reacts without reflex – snapping his teeth and snarling. "He is a <em>beast</em>. Look at him – he does not even know what we're saying. Do you, boy?"</p><p>Tim does know. Jason is a very good teacher, and Tim would much rather have Jason in charge of his lessons than this soft-bellied fat-fingered ass.</p><p>"I tell him to read. He stares ahead. I tell him to write, and he makes a mess of the parchment and ink. I tell him to recite and he snaps at me. He is <em>impossible</em>."</p><p>What use does Tim have of any of these skills?</p><p>Everyone in the North knows how to read and write. If you cannot read or write, how can you understand the measure of a bounty, or the conditions for a challenge? But it is not truly <em>necessary</em> in the way these people seem to think it is. They are <em>backwards</em>.</p><p>They read paper instead of the sun and the sky, and they write how many of their little gold trinkets they have instead of how many leaves of holly it takes to subdue a man. They speak poems of star-crossed lovers who die of their own stupidity when they should be speaking of dangers fast approaching.</p><p>The King listens, nodding occasionally – but his focus is on some sort of document in front of him. The tutor releases him in order to more fully express how much trouble Tim is with both hands.</p><p>Tim eyes the man warily before taking a better look around the room. There are many books here. More than even in the room he and the other children he is being taught in. These look to be in better condition, too.</p><p>Books are not common in the North. Many of their stories are told through song-voice-magic, ingrained into memory with the feel-taste-image of the magic rather than the form of the runes they take. Paper does not often survive in the North and is mostly used in the Southern steads, where the tradition of <em>domovyk </em>is still strong.</p><p>Most of their books are records of vendettas and blood-ties. Easy to claim, easy to forge, hard to prove - which is why it was important for there to be witnesses, and for it to be recorded so that all could recognize them.</p><p>No one stops him when he edges closer to one of the small tables covered with paper – maps, Tim realizes. They are maps. He does not know the places or the markings, but he recognizes the compass and the name of the Imperial City. Tim runs a finger over the edge of the paper, it is stiff – hard, less like paper more like leather, perhaps -</p><p>"Do not <em>touch</em> that!" Tim startles back, yanking his hand back in time to avoid getting it smacked. He turns to glare up at his tutor, who's gone red in the face -</p><p>"Do you like cartography?" The King says, pausing in his writing, looking at Tim with mild interest. Tim turns his glare onto him. The man smiles, a small curve of his lips that makes Tim want to toss his horns at him, "Do they have maps in the North?"</p><p>"No use." Tim replies. There are a few maps, but they are too general to be of any real meaning. The ownership and location of steads and stead-lines changes frequently. What is there one day may not be there the next. It is simply just easier to remember. Tim turns back towards the map. It seems more decorative than anything.</p><p>"Can you read a map?" The King asks, and Tim turns to give him an annoyed look. The tutor makes a noise of absolute <em>horror</em>. Tim toss his head, and misses the weight of his horns. "I only ask because you are doing very poorly in your studies. This is not the first time one of your teachers has come to me. You seem to be doing poorly in the training ring, as well."</p><p>Only because the trainers keep stopping him and telling him to use a dozen and a half extra steps to do something he could do in four. Tim opens his mouth to say so, but is stopped when the tutor closes his hand around Tim's neck and shakes him like a kitten.</p><p>"Show some respect, this is the <em>King</em>." The man hisses. Tim tries to squirm out of the man's grip, reaches up to dig his nails into the man's flesh -</p><p>"Stop." The King says, and Tim moves away as soon as the man's fingers release him.</p><p>"Yes." Tim says. "There are no maps in the north. But I can read them." It is harder to read a map than to just speak of a desired location, but Tim knows how.</p><p>His tutor looks at him like he is lying. The King hums, beckons Tim over.</p><p>Tim warily looks between him and his tutor before moving to kneel by the great desk the King sits behind. There are several large maps unfurled upon its surface. The King pulls another one out of its tube, unrolling it on top of the other ones. Tim blinks in surprise, narrowing his eyes at the King.</p><p>It is very crude, very sparse, very outdated, and very <em>wrong</em>, but it is a map of the North, particularly the southern steads that mark the boundary between the lands of the Immortal King and the frost-born.</p><p>The King taps his finger against the compass – "Do you know your directions?"</p><p>Tim rolls his eyes, steps back and points out the King's window – "Where the wardens watch." Tim turns to point at the wall behind the desk. "Shifting and shimmering sleeping sands." Tim points to the wall facing the windows, "The land of the Eternal Eda." Tim points at the door past the tutor. "Never forget your home."</p><p>"Very good." The King says, "And can you tell me about this map?"</p><p>"It is wrong." For one thing. "And old." Tim pauses, watches the tutor turn an interesting shade of purple. "And means nothing. It looks like it was drawn by a drunken toddler."</p><p>Or as if someone struck by a <em>huldr</em>'s fist wrote the names and forgot half the sounds. Then had a fit and forgot which way was up and which way was down. Then started writing a drinking song mid-way. Tim wrinkles his nose.</p><p>Tim points out the parts that are wrong, and grudgingly writes in the corrections when the King hands him the feather.</p><p>When Tim is done the King turns back to the tutor -</p><p>"Well. The boy is clearly not as addled as you seem to think he is. Perhaps it is just a matter of the manner he is being taught in."</p><p>-</p><p>"You are going to get <em>caught</em>." Jason hisses as Tim prepares to slip out of the dorms.</p><p>"Clearly I am not. The guards don't <em>care</em> as long as I come back on time." Tim replies, "I've been doing this for four years and no one has stopped me yet." Tim secures the knife he stole from the armory against his hip. Either no one has noticed its absence or no one cared enough to say anything.</p><p>Jason makes a frustrated noise, cupping the back of Tim's head and drawing their foreheads together.</p><p>"You will be the end of me, you know that, kid? If only you could show these skills of yours during <em>practice</em>."</p><p>Tim has spent the past four years making enemies of his trainers and allies of his fellow transplants. Even if he did show just how much he has learned, their tutors would inevitably find a way to call him a cheater or worse. That is what always happens. The Southern-born soldiers are <em>always</em> held above the former slaves and servants who join the King's ranks.</p><p>There are a few tutors to whom Tim shows his true capabilities. It is that way with all of the former-slave-servants here. They are their own community.</p><p>"I'd feel better if you let me come with you." Jason says. Tim shakes his head.</p><p>"You are too close to the throne. They would not let me pass if you came with me. I will be back before dawn. Cover for me?"</p><p>"Yeah. North wind be with you."</p><p>-</p><p>Watching Ra's train is like watching one of the legends come to life. Not that he would <em>say</em> that out <em>loud</em>. Gods, no, the man has enough pride as it is. He does not need to know that growing up, he was the subject matter of some of the great tales of the North.</p><p>The fighting style of the Southerners is circular. These people and their <em>circles</em>. They talk in circles, their magic is in circles, their fighting is in circles. Their cities are built in circles, their script is done with curves and links, their <em>foods</em> are circular.</p><p>It is frustrating and beautiful.</p><p>Tim rests his cheek on his knee and watches Ra's' feet over the packed and worn dirt. Each step is smooth and steady, practiced and perfect.</p><p>He allows his eyes to slip – just enough into his Southern form that he can see properly again. He tracks the energy of the Earth as it flows, into Ra's' – turning a golden-green, lightening until it is almost white at his core, and moving out again. The air around him is a haze of that color. Glittering and pure. It makes Tim think of the magic he felt at the doors of the Lazarus Pit.</p><p>Even now, how many years later – looking down at himself, he can still see flecks of it within himself. Bright, and almost completely absorbed by his own blue-white.</p><p>"You are lost in thought, beloved one." Tim wrinkles his nose at the epithet. "I would hear your troubles, if you would only voice them."</p><p>"Perhaps <em>you</em> are my troubles and that is why I do not voice them. Far be it for me to complain about my lord-husband." Tim replies, idly flicking one of the bells around his ankle.</p><p>The bells, Tim thinks, were supposed to be Ra's' idea of a jest. Tim takes them as a challenge to figure out how to move without causing the damned things to chime like he is about to rob the place. For such tiny, delicate looking things they are so very <em>loud</em>. Thinking about it, the man might have had them inscribed to increase their volume.</p><p>"Ah, then it is nothing new." Ra's replies, still moving through exercises. "I was worried that something other than myself was occupying your mind."</p><p>"Do you ever get tired of having to carry that arrogance upon your neck?" Tim snorts. "No. It is nothing new. It is the same old pains of having to take care of you and your lands while a quarter your so-called nobles think I am of only service on my back, half thinking I am a mindless beast that you have tamed, and the remaining few smart enough to keep their mouths shut when it counts."</p><p>"You are also good on your knees." Ra's comments, but before Tim can retaliate – perhaps by throwing this nice, heavy grapefruit at his head – Ra's continues, "And what of their rumors? It is their fault for being so short-minded as to forget that you are my sword. And is it not all the better for you and your little league of spies? The more they underestimate you the easier it is for you to trap them in your web of deceits."</p><p>"If half your court were not so cursedly <em>dumb</em> I would not have to go through half the deceits and lies I do per day. Why do you even keep them <em>around</em>?"</p><p>"Because." Ra's says, folding himself down in front of Tim, lightly tapping Tim's chin with his finger, "At least this way they are too dimwitted to be true thorns in my side, and any duplicity on their part is easily picked apart by my beloved one's sharp fingers. Now come, you have not been practicing your inscriptions as I have asked of you."</p><p>-</p><p>"I shall step down from the throne for some time." Ra's says, "Would you come with me, or remain here as Talia's sword?"</p><p>Shiva is Talia's sword, and Tim thinks it is highly unlikely that the woman would appreciate it if Tim took her place.</p><p>Tim kneels, hand over his heart, "I am the Immortal King's sword, and no one else's."</p><p>Ra's smiles, "Pack your things. We shall leave shortly."</p><p>-</p><p>"I am foreign-born, not ignorant." Tim cuts in, "Stop speaking to me as if I am a babe with milk-teeth, you disgrace the throne by thinking of the King's blade as such."</p><p>The minister stammers an apology, clearing his throat before resuming his explanation of raider activity along the Western trade routes. He shoots Tim a nervous look every now and again, but stops using small words and his pedantic explanations of terms.</p><p>Just because Tim's skin is pale and his back is branded does not mean that he is <em>ignorant</em> of current affairs. Tim thinks he is probably more up to date on what is happening in the country than <em>they</em> are.</p><p>He wonders when the last time these men went into the bazars and the slums, the last time they spoke to the bakers and the farmers, the soldiers and the servants – the whores and the beggars. Tim wonders when the last time they looked at a slave, turned to their sisters and mothers and daughters, asked advice of an elder.</p><p>There are many who know Tim by face and name among the common folk, in and out of the Imperial City. His name has traveled by word of mouth and there are few who would great him with apprehension or dread.</p><p>Tim is not the King's Guard or the King's blade to these people, but the King's Ear.</p><p>When the ministers are done explaining the various problems involved with the various tactics they each have suggested to combat the raiders Tim dismisses them. He turns to Prudence -</p><p>"Am I the only one who thinks that this was pointless?"</p><p>Prudence shrugs. "They have never seen combat. They probably would not know the dull end of a sword from the pointy end if we stabbed them with one."</p><p>Tim sighs, "And I have to report one of these asinine plans to the King."</p><p>"I do not envy you that conversation. At least you know why the King was so delighted when you volunteered to sit in on these meetings in his place."</p><p>Tim pinches the bridge of his nose. "This is probably pay back for how many times I ditched lessons, is it not?"</p><p>"Probably." Prudence grins, punching his shoulder. "But hey, at least you can talk back now, right?"</p><p>-</p><p>"You are not paying attention at all, are you?" Bruce says, and Tim feels only a little bit guilty when he turns back to the man. He is a definite improvement over his last tutors, and Tim has learned <em>much</em> under him. But it does not change the fact that some subjects have no appeal to him.</p><p>"I am sorry, teacher." Tim says, turning back to the tome that Bruce has been reading out of. It is a history of the South's interactions with the North.</p><p>"No. I can understand." Bruce says, closing the book, smile playing upon his features. "It must seem very redundant to have to listen to your own history."</p><p>Annoying more like – "I should pay attention." Tim says, "I do not mean to waste your time."</p><p>"It is understandable. You are at that age. No doubt you would rather be outside, or perhaps practicing spell work or your tumbling rather than listening to this." Bruce chuckles, "I could never get Dick to sit still for any of this. Jason was only marginally better. But that was mostly because he would take over his lessons for himself."</p><p>Tim turns, perks up a little at the image of Bruce's wards as children. It is always hard to imagine his elders in his place. Jason and Dick have always seemed the way they are. It is unrealistic, Tim knows, for all things must start young, but Jason and Dick are simply <em>themselves</em>. It is hard to imagine Jason – who knows everything – to be at a stage in his life where he does not know anything, or Dick who seems to have a boundless amount of patience to be unable to sit still.</p><p>"When Dick was younger he was very excitable." Bruce says, a soft smile playing upon his features. "He wanted to know everything, but he never could sit still long enough for the answers. He would make his own and build worlds and fantasies and histories on his own and spiral off into dreams. Jason would only ever pick at one subject at a time. It was hard to teach him something when he did not want to hear it. When he wanted to learn something he wanted to learn all of it, and only when he was done with that would he allow me to teach him something new."</p><p>Bruce hums, tapping his fingers on the book's cover -</p><p>"How did you learn these in the North? How did they teach you?"</p><p>Tim bites his lip, shrugs his shoulders.</p><p>"Is it true you do not read in the north? And that you do not use spell work?" Bruce asks, Tim shifts his weight, sitting back to think the question over.</p><p>"Yes. And no. Our language is not the same as yours. Our – self. Our bodies are different than yours." Tim frowns, and tries to think up the right way to say it, and can't.</p><p>"You have fewer words." Bruce says, "Dick and Jason often have a hard time translating."</p><p>"Many of your concepts – we do not have them. Where we come from, many of your concepts can be either reduced or done away with altogether." Tim bites his lip, "But that is not it. It is – your language is so <em>shallow</em>."</p><p>Bruce frowns and Tim shakes his head -</p><p>"No. It is – it is hard to explain. I do not mean – your words are <em>just words</em>. There is no <em>substance</em> to them. No <em>seithr</em>. You string words together and you find meaning in their order. But that is not the world, that is not the way of energy." Tim leans forward and traces his finger on the table, "The spirit of the Earth flows through all things. It is free flowing and eternal. It cannot be called forth nor destroyed."</p><p>Bruce leans forward, nodding, "Yes. The world is a closed system."</p><p>"When you move you are moving this energy, with every movement there is <em>seithr</em>. Intent. And each movement must in turn cause something else to change. In order to create you must first disrupt and destroy. It is easy. There is no need for words or your <em>spell work</em> in order to do this. You must simply – " Tim pauses, tries to find the words. "It is so hard to explain. I do not know if I can do it. No one ever told me how or why, all I had to do was watch and learn."</p><p>"But your histories, your traditions – "</p><p>"Common <em>sense</em>." Tim stresses. "It is. If you could see-taste-feel-hear as I could, as I could in my true skin, you would understand."</p><p>Bruce is quiet for a moment before folding his hands together. "In your Northern form – are you saying that you. You can see more than we can? That you can see magic, itself?"</p><p>It is not the right words. Tim closes his eyes and looks into himself, and tries to put words to the things that were taken from him -</p><p>Tim holds out his hands and imagines <em>hamrammr</em>.</p><p>"There is all this <em>seithr</em> in the world, Bruce." Tim says. "Intent. It is in all things. Potential to do things, to become something else. And I cannot begin to describe it. How would you describe the taste of an orange? How would you describe the feeling of sunshine on your face? How do you describe a breeze? How do you describe the color of the trees, or the way the light glitters upon the water? And our language reflects that. For you – you who can only see the things in front of you, your words are numerous and reflecting of that. But for us – our words are our hands, our magic, our voices. So when we speak to each other – to tell stories, to tell news and opinions – we are not telling with our voices. We are showing. It is not understanding words – sounds, but it is understanding sounds and colors and sensations." Tim sighs. "If I had my form I would show you."</p><p>"It sounds very interesting, Tim." Bruce says, "And if that is the way you learned everything, I can understand why you find our ways of teaching to be so unworthy of your attention."</p><p>-</p>

</p><p>Tim wakes up – too early, the sun is not even up – to a soft breeze. Not unusual, the palace is often drafty. Tim rubs his cheek against his pillow, and the bedding is soft and smooth underneath his bare skin. He does not think that he'll ever get used to sleeping on such finery. Such luxury.</p><p>But he has to admit that this is probably one of the few things he considers a bonus to being the High Consort.</p><p>Ah, yes, the inability to swear and curse an idiot for their rampant disrespect in public but absolutely delightful beds.</p><p>He can feel that Ra's is still by his side – a hot, and heavy weight, the fervid glow of his <em>seithr</em> crisp and almost numbing - , and Tim opens an eye to see the man sitting up, watching him. There is tension in his shoulders and something pensive in the way Ra's is looking at him.</p><p>"Your stamina is annoying." Tim says, yawning, "What troubles you?"</p><p>"You. As always." Ra's replies, running his fingertips over Tim's bare back. Tim closes his eyes, relaxing into the soft bedding, curling his arms around the pillow. He can feel where Ra's' fingers linger over his brands, tracing the blurred and distorted slave brand, and then the clear mark of a murderer. A dead man.</p><p>"You think so loudly. I hardly have room in my head for my <em>own</em> thoughts." Tim says.</p><p>"Are your thoughts not my thoughts as well?" Ra's presses his thumb to the center of the slave mark – "The Lazarus could take these away."</p><p>"I do not want your fire." Tim says, "It is a miracle I survived the small amount you poured onto my belly."</p><p>Not even a scar was left of the stab wound that should have killed him. But the magic, the <em>seithr</em> of Lazarus remains mixed with Tim's own. Even now, four years later. Foreign but not whenever Tim looks at himself.</p><p>"Healing the scars would be simple. It would not require you to take anything at all. You do not have to carry these."</p><p>"No. I do not. But your pit cannot erase the fact that I was once a slave, that I was once to be hanged, and it cannot erase the fact that I am born of the Northern frosts." Tim opens his eyes. "Does that displease you?"</p><p>"If I said yes, what would you do about it?" Ra's raises an eyebrow, shakes his head,  "No. You are your history, and all the more beautiful and savage for it."</p><p>"Then do not speak of erasing the scars your country has left on me to make me so beautiful and savage. Or are you ashamed?" Tim sits up on his elbows, tilting his head. "Does it shame you that your High Consort is a former slave? A Northern savage? An uncultured heathen?" It would certainly explain how many damned layers Tim has to wear as High Consort.</p><p>(He still does not understand how the Princess' consorts can get away with dodging these traditions. He thinks that they could probably get away with murder, too. Whereas if Tim so much as sneezes wrong the nobles start gossiping as if he set a fire under their asses.)</p><p>He honestly thought Selina was joking when she was first teaching him the various intricacies of presenting himself as High Consort. He was sadly mistaken.</p><p>Half the servants either fret over how Tim seems to shed his jewels and layers like a trail of breadcrumbs out of a child's tale, and the other half is viciously approving and actively encouraging of it.</p><p>"You do not shame me." Ra's frowns, "Do not put words into my mouth, beloved one. I simply wonder if it pains you. Forgive my attempts at being considerate."</p><p>"Ah. And now you sulk." Tim laughs as Ra's turns away from him to reach for one of the several books that seem to trail Ra's around like perpetual shadows. Ra's moves to get up and move onto the balcony for light, Tim rolls his eyes and turns onto his side. "You are an overgrown <em>child</em>. Sulking because I ask you valid questions. What would your people say if they could see you pouting like this? The Immortal King glaring and sulking like a babe with his milk teeth because he could not get his way."</p><p>Ra's ignores him, turning his back towards him as he sits on the balcony. Tim sighs, rolling out of bed, abandoning the warm and comfortable nest of pillows and blankets to join him.</p><p>"If anyone saw you like this they would have a fit." Ra's says when Tim leans against the balcony railing. Tim raises an eyebrow, crossing his arms across his bare chest. The air is heavy with the sweet smell of flowers from below. It is the season for Talia's favorite jacarandas, and they cheerfully shed their petals onto anything and everything. It has been driving the servants absolutely <em>crazy</em> trying to keep the grounds clean.</p><p>"I am the King's High Consort. Why would it be unusual for me to be seen on your balcony? Am I not supposed to be here? Where else would I be? Chained to your throne? Locked up in a dungeon? Unconscious and practically dead to the world because of your prowess?"</p><p>"You are so very <em>difficult</em>. You find all of this amusing. It is a most odd hour, High Consort. And you wear your horns and nothing else." Ra's sighs as Tim cocks his hip. "It is improper. Beautiful, of course, but improper."</p><p>"The most beautiful things in your country are the improper ones. And are we not bound? I do not see why the matter of our sex should be kept for the seclusion of the Consort's Garden when you have a perfectly serviceable bed right <em>here</em>.<em>" </em>Tim tugs at Ra's hair, "Speaking of – come back to said bed, Immortal King. The sun has barely even begun to rise and you have a busy day attending to the drooling idiots of your court. You need your rest."</p><p>Tim holds his hand out, and pulls his King back to the comforts of their rooms for a few more hours.</p><p>-</p><p>Politics is something that Tim understands. It is slightly different, here in the South – but in essence it is nothing new. In the South they only have <em>war</em> and <em>diplomacy</em>. And everything else is unspoken as <em>intrigue</em>.</p><p>In the North, there is <em>low war</em> and there is <em>high war</em>. High war is a challenge, physical or not – a declaration. Plainly spoken for all to hear. Low war is politics. It is treaties and blood and binding. Flesh and womb and blood combining and cutting and forming in order to create allies. Families. Both are respected as forms of war. Negotiation. There is no shame in settling a conflict with a rival stead by exchanging binding flesh. There is no dishonor in an ambush.</p><p>If you win a bout by spitting in your opponent's eyes, or by using the gifts of the <em>hammask</em> that your opponent does not have, that is not wrong. It is still fair.</p><p>Anything that can save blood is good. Life is most sacred above all things. More than honor, more than flesh, more than womb, more than wisdom, more than power – it is life that matters. Knowing when to live, when to die, when to kill, and when to spare your blade.</p><p>And these tactics are all tools for knowing when to do what.</p><p>But in the South they view such tactics as – not tactics, but tricks. <em>Unspeakable</em> tricks, as well.</p><p>Still, in the end - it is on the table. It is still a tool.</p><p>While the Southerners refuse to acknowledge such ways, they still use it. Nobles pry secrets out of whores, seal lips with gold, hold knives to breasts, and whisper silken-sweet words.</p><p>It probably irks them that Tim knows the game better than any of them.</p><p>After all – it is something actually <em>spoken of</em> and <em>taught</em> in the North. He has been versed in these ways since he was a babe at his mother's breast.</p><p>"How do you feel about turning the court on its head?" Tim asks Jason as they watch the dancers swirling from the private Consort's gallery. They are a beautiful swirl of reds and blues, and Tim almost feels bad for the fact that he thinks that Dick could do it better.</p><p>"I think that I should have figured you would say something like that. Life in luxury is too boring for you. And for me – I am so disappointed, little brother. Not even <em>one</em> assassination attempt and you have been High Consort for almost two months already. I thought being your guard was going to be a challenge. I can feel my skills dulling as we speak." Jason says, "That being said, when am I <em>not</em> game for whatever crazy scheme you come up with?"</p><p>-</p><p>"No grappling." Cassandra says, tapping his shoulder as he pauses to try and re-focus his eyes and stop seeing four of her, "The King wants you to learn it <em>this</em> way."</p><p>"The King's way is annoying."</p><p>"Only because I keep beating you." Cass points out as Tim bounces on his heels. "Your way is not better. You will get used to it. I did.  How will you defend if you do not know how? Besides, if you master this way you'll have one up on Z."</p><p>Tim sighs, and he thinks this would be much easier if he had access to his own skin again.</p><p>"One more time." Tim asks, she smiles, squeezes his shoulder before stepping back and resuming her stance. "I may not like it, but I will learn it. Eventually."</p><p>It will just take more time. More time to understand their way of thinking. This way of moving. More time for Tim to fully understand how these people think and how they feel.</p><p>Tim has been here for a long time, but Tim thinks he might never truly understand this place.</p><p>Perhaps he will grow to love it. But for now -</p><p>"Practice makes perfect." Cass reminds him as he stumbles through a crescent-kick.</p><p>-</p><p>"You have been taking out vendetta." Slade says when he comes to visit Tim again.</p><p>Rose is not with him this time. She has gone on a journey to seek out a white eyed-raven, or something. Tim is not sure about it. Slade doesn't seem to sure about it either. Rose is rarely very clear about her visions. Mostly because it amuses her to confuse others.</p><p>"Word of the pale-skinned Northerner who has been killing raiders on vendetta, and freeing slaves and servants has reached even the borders. You are practically your own child-story. Your dam and sire would be so proud of you if they were alive to hear of this."</p><p>Tim snorts, motions for his blood-brother to lower his voice. The King has a nasty ability to sneak up on him, and he would rather the man not know that Tim has been sneaking out. Ra's would look so damned <em>smug</em>. Tim doesn't know why he thinks that. But he <em>knows it</em>.</p><p>"It seems like it never ends." Tim admits, "As soon as I finish one vendetta, another one appears. And then I am being asked to find a mother, a brother, a sister. And then I am asked to take vendetta for the dead so that they may find peace, then I am asked for help ferrying children and elders to safety and to relatives and friends. And then they ask for advice and for direction and for aide. I think my own vendetta has gotten out of my hands."</p><p>Slade barks a laugh.</p><p>"I think I would be proud if it were not so <em>embarrassing</em>. They look at me like I am a hero of legends, or like I was a gift straight of a dragon's heart or something." Tim mumbles, "Word of mouth spreads too <em>fast</em>."</p><p>"You are respected." Slade says, lips quirking up at the corners. "And that is not such a bad thing to be. You have gained your own name, here. Freer of slaves, bringer of justice. I suppose that is not the worst thing to be."</p><p>"Yes. And now the King is looking to make me his Commander." Tim replies. "All the more reason I do not need anyone to find out about my late night activities."</p><p>"Ah." Slade strokes his beard, "Yes. I do not imagine that these courtiers would appreciate you being the King's hand. They would be even more pained to find out that you are the hero of their so-called common-folk. You are turning these people inside out, flame-touched one."</p><p>"Honestly, I am surprised no one has stopped me. I have been here almost seven years. Doing this work for three. At some point, you would think that someone would connect the dots."</p><p>"They think you a stupid savage, and so they do not see the practiced strikes." Slade shrugs. "People see only what they want to see. You know that."</p><p>"I am still somewhat insulted." Tim sighs. "How <em>many</em> pale-skinned boys named Tim can there be capable of taking down this many raiders?"</p><p>"I think you underestimate just how much the people adore you, boy. They would not sell out their savior so readily. They are not nearly fool enough to actually tell the truth to any official. As far as the King's men are concerned, the raider-killer is a red-clad boy who flies over buildings as if he has wings. They have taken to calling him Robin."</p><p>"I wear a red cloak on accident <em>once</em> and no one ever lets it <em>go</em>." Tim groans and puts his head into his hands. Slade throws his head back and <em>laughs</em>.</p><p>-</p><p>"My name is Prudence." The girl says, "You new?"</p><p>"Yes." Tim says, uncomfortably. Thanks to Jason's patient teaching, he knows enough of this new language to pass. But he is still uncertain about how to reply. These people are different, their ways are so different. There are – they are not equal and there is no way for Tim to understand <em>how</em>. Not at first sight – he does not know it. He does not know how to tell a noble from a servant from a merchant from a soldier from a scholar. it is puzzling and confusing and Tim feels a little more homesick every day.</p><p>There are few girls in the King's army – Jason has told him that most of the girls do not join the army but are usually scholars, the tacticians, the magic-users, the healers. Tim finds it odd that these soldiers do not learn how to do all of these things.</p><p>"Come on." She says, pulling his wrist, "Meet the others. Foreigners have to stay together."</p><p>Prudence introduces him to Z, who is not a foreigner but is from a border village near the East. Owens is, like Jason, from the Western countries.</p><p>"You made friends?" Jason asks when he meets up with Tim later. "That was fast."</p><p>"They are nice." Tim replies, lifting his hand to wave at some of the other foreigner-born children Z introduced him to. "It feels – less lonely."</p><p>Jason smiles at him, ruffles Tim's hair.</p><p>"I am glad that you get along with them. It is hard to be a stranger in a strange land."</p><p>-</p><p>Tim is not unfamiliar with the idea of bodily modifications, or skin-paints. In the North, they often use <em>woads</em> before going into ceremonial rites, or when they are about to go into challenges or particularly difficult hunts.</p><p>But they serve a different purpose here. And they are much more – intricate in a way.</p><p>Selina draws another line over his ankle.</p><p>Here they are – decorative, meant to appeal to <em>others</em>. It is odd, that these designs should mean something of himself, of <em>people</em>. They do not speak to the spirits or channel <em>seithr</em> but to people. It is both fascinating and puzzling.</p><p>"Hold still." Selina says, "Are you finished reading?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>Selina raises an eyebrow. "Did you understand it?"</p><p>"No." Tim admits, ducking his head. "There is – so much to understand. How to eat, what to eat, where to look – there is so much to know. Is all of this really necessary?"</p><p>Selina laughs, "Is this enough to make you change your mind?"</p><p>"Too late for that." Tim snorts, glancing down, "I already said yes, I cannot say no <em>now</em>."</p><p>Selina laughs, "Not nearly as easy as you thought it would be, is it?"</p><p>"No." Tim laughs, "I suppose even sex is complicated in the South, is it not?" They both laugh, and Tim turns to look out over the verdant landscape of the Consort's Garden. "I have been here too long, perhaps."</p><p>Selina's hand is firm around his ankle as she continues to draw.</p><p>"Do you regret it?"</p><p>"No." Tim says. "I do not know regret." Tim smiles at her, "It feels like I have finally learned how to be a soldier, and now I have to learn to be something else."</p><p>"You are a smart boy." Selina says, "You'll get it."</p><p>-</p><p>"Who are you?" The girl says, as Tim stands, wiping blood off his hands.</p><p>"Tim." He answers, unlocking the cage and tossing her the keys to her chains. "Are you hurt? Are there any more of you?"</p><p>"No. You killed him. Are you – are you one of the King's men?" She says as she cautiously crawls out, "You do not sound like you are from here."</p><p>"I am from the North." Tim says, "Are there more of you?"</p><p>"They were sold." She says, yanking a stray tarp to wrap around herself. "Why did you kill him, if you are not one of the King's men, Tim?"</p><p>"Because this man has wronged me." Tim replies, "He brought me low, he brought me to this land, and I have vendetta with him for that." Tim holds his hand out to her, "Do you have anywhere to go?"</p><p>"I will find a way." She says, "But – are you pursuing this vendetta against others as well?"</p><p>"Yes." Tim has found only a handful of the raiding company who is responsible for the death of his mother's stead and his branding in the past few years. And it's taken him even longer to gain the ability to properly fulfill the vendetta as well. "Why?"</p><p>"I am looking for my brother. We are twins." She says, "But we got separated. I need to find him. Will you help me?"</p><p>"He might not be here." He could be dead.</p><p>"I will wait. I will look and I will wait." She says, straightening her shoulders. "I can't go home without Cullen. There is no home without Cullen."</p><p>Tim bites his cheek – he is in no position to be looking for lost brothers for lost sisters. But -</p><p>"I will do my best." Tim says, "If I see him, I will tell you. And I will try to free him for you. But I cannot promise you anything."</p><p>"It's enough that you just look." She says, "Thank you, Tim. I am Harper, and I won't forget this."</p><p>-</p><p>"You could have gone back to the north. Any stead would have taken you. Is that not our way? We would never turn away a child stolen by raiders, regardless of what stead they used to be. Do you not still have the Ravager and the Terminator as your own? Your father has flesh still living who would have taken you." Ivan-<em>jarls-born</em> says, waving a hand, air frosting in its wake. Tim pinches the bridge of his nose.</p><p>And <em>oh</em> how he enjoys and loathes these visits from his frost-born-brothers. They either congratulate him on bringing the Kingdom of the Immortal King to its knees as his own, or they look at him and call him traitor to his blood. The former he welcomes with open arms, and open doors.</p><p>They are fun to spar with, and are always amiable to being directed towards interesting Southern-beasts to challenge.</p><p>The <em>latter</em>, however, make Tim want to throw them out by the <em>horns</em>.</p><p>"I am sworn, frost-born." Tim stresses, "Do you not understand? I am blood bound. They are my <em>honor</em>. How could I leave them?"</p><p>"Honor? <em>What honor</em>? These maggots would not know honor if it bit them in the ass." Ivan snorts, "There is no disgrace in leaving behind whatever ties you have here to return to the frost-and-thunder. Do you not miss the crack of the thunderbird and the scream of the gales? The dance of the <em>huldr</em> and the song of the dragons?"</p><p>"Of course I miss it." Tim beats his chest with his open palm, glaring, "Is the land of ice-and-snow not my own flesh? Am I not born with the horns of the dragon-mothers and the eyes of the deep-ones? Do I not have <em>Ymir's</em> tongue in my mouth? Does winter's breath not coat my skin? Do not put words in my mouth. I did not say that I have forsaken the North."</p><p>"Then why do you not come <em>home</em>?" Ivan says, holding his hands out towards Tim.</p><p>"Because the North is my flesh, Ivan-<em>jarls-born</em>, but it is not <em>home</em>. For flesh is not home, <em>blood</em> is." Tim says, "And I have blood <em>here</em>. I cannot leave my blood. That is true dishonor. To forge a blood-bond then leave your bonded ones behind. Is that not our greatest teaching? Handed down from sire to son, from dam to daughter? Above frost and water, above flesh, above womb – there is <em>blood</em>. Without blood there is no life, no <em>seithr</em>."</p><p>Ivan shakes his head, "These Southerners – what kind of blood? What do they know of blood? There is no honor among them. They will fail you. And you will see – your blood is wasted. They will betray you – use you and bring you low. Like the stories of the oldest jarls. And then you will wish you came back to the North."</p><p>"I refuse to believe that." Tim says. "No matter where the winds take us, as long as there is <em>seithr</em> then there is <em>blood</em>. And no one can say who is worthy of my blood but <em>me.</em>"</p>

</p><p>Dick's quarters are a strange pile of <em>everything</em>. And every time Tim comes here he feels like the piles have grown and he never even knows where to look. He has all these trinkets – glass and metal and paper and cloth. Tim's not actually sure if Dick has a system for knowing where what is or how he remembers anything.</p><p>It's easy to get distracted in Dick's room, but when Dick is there and talking it is utterly impossible. Dick is all energy and directed motion. He calls attention to things and keeps it. Tim leans over the low table, following Dick's finger as he traces the route he was taking to visit the Western cities.</p><p>Tim watches, fascinated as Dick tells him about the people he has met in other countries, the foods he's eaten, and how <em>different</em> it is. Dick even teaches him a few words and shows him little trinkets from those countries.</p><p>"But which one is your <em>favorite</em>?" Tim asks when Dick stops to reach around for another map, "What are the parts you like best?"</p><p>Dick laughs, ruffling Tim's hair. "I like the <em>people best. </em>Oh goddesses – there are so many kinds of <em>people</em> in the world, Tim! You wouldn't even believe me. There is a country in the Southern Isles where there are only women? They are very beautiful, and they are very strong. Have you heard of them? They are the Amazons of Themiscrya."</p><p>"I have heard of them. They are the strongest warriors." Tim says, "Many of the frost-born go to challenge them but never win. You have met them?"</p><p>"Yes. I am very good friends with one of their Princesses. Her name is Donna, and she is very beautiful, and very powerful. When Jason was younger he had a crush on her. Did he tell you that? Oh, don't tell him I told you. He'd sulk at me for <em>ages</em>." Dick turns around, rummaging around one of the drawers and pulls out a small mirror. He waves his hand at Tim, coaxing him to lean forward. "Watch this."</p><p>Dick traces his finger in the air over the mirror, Tim recognizes the script as Western – more lines and spaces –, before pressing his palm down over the glowing rune and covering the mirror's surface with his hand. He removes his hand and tilts the mirror at Tim -</p><p>"Look."</p><p>Tim gasps when he sees the image of a beautiful, dark haired woman sparring with a younger blonde-haired girl in a training ring.</p><p>"This is Donna." Dick says, waving his hand over the mirror's surface. Tim gapes as the image ripples and changes to show a woman in purple armor with orange skin – orange skin! – flying in the sky. "And this is Kori. She's from Tamaran – that is a country across the sea." Dick pushes some of the maps off the table to find one buried underneath.</p><p>Tim holds the mirror in his hands in awe, watching as Kori flies through the air – waving at other men and women with orange skin like hers.</p><p>Dick pulls out a map of the world, and he points to the Kingdom of the Immortal King, "This is where we are." Dick drags his finger south, past the Southern isles, then into open sea, and then left towards the lower edge of the Western lands and to a cluster of islands in the middle of the ocean.</p><p>"This is Tamaran. They are kind of like here. Tropical. But these islands are volcanoes."</p><p>"What is a volcano?" Tim asks, tilting his head. Dick hums, twisting his lips as he frowns.</p><p>"I think they have them in the North, but they are not as active as they are on Tamaran. Hm. You may have seen them, they are tall. Like mountains. But they spit liquid fire." Dick makes a roughly triangular shape with his hands, "There is a story, I believe."</p><p>Tim frowns, thinking – "<em>Oh</em>. Yes! I think I know! The story of the giant's blood. I know that!"</p><p>"Yes! That one! That is what a volcano is." Dick says, waving his hand again, "And this is Barbara." Dick smiles, "A lady after my own heart."</p><p>Tim looks down at the mirror, blinks at the woman's face. She has red hair, and wears spectacles. Tim gasps when the image clears and resolves to show her sitting in a moving chair. A chair with <em>wheels! </em></p><p>"Barbara is the daughter of the daughter of the Knight Commander of Gotham." Dick says, resting his chin on his hands, smiling, "She's very strong. She was once a lead member of Gotham's high guard, but she lost the ability to walk in a fight. Of course, she is still a terribly powerful opponent, but she no longer goes out into skirmishes."</p><p>"This is amazing. This mirror – it is magic? It can see anyone in the world?" Tim asks, running his fingers along its edge. "How? Who made it? Where is it from? How did they make it?"</p><p>Dick laughs, "Gotham is a city of innovation. They are always tinkering with things, making what is old new and what is new old. You can communicate with this mirror as well. If the other person has a matching mirror." Dick takes the mirror and turns it over, showing Tim several seals and runes on the back, written around the jewels. "Bruce and I worked to make it. Bruce is an inventor of quite a many things like this."</p><p>"This is amazing." Tim gasps, looking up at Dick, "Bruce made it? Do you think he could teach me? How? How does he make it? With what does he make it? What are these words? Are these gems of any importance? What are they? What is it called? How many partner-mirrors can it connect to? How does it <em>work</em>?"</p><p>"Hm. I could show you." Dick says, frowning, "But it won't work if you made it. Your magic is bound."</p><p>"Teach me anyway? Please?"</p><p>Dick smiles, ruffling Tim's hair before getting up, "Alright, let me go get some materials. You sure you want to learn? Jason's told me about you, kid. You tend to make your tutors cry."</p><p>"Only when they deserve it." Tim mutters, flushing as Dick throws his head back and laughs.</p><p>In the end, Jason has to come to physically drag Tim away from Dick's rooms.</p><p>"But – I am not yet finished – " Tim whines as Jason hauls him up and starts dragging him away.</p><p>"You have training. Remember? You said you were going to practice your archery with Owen." Jason says, kicking Dick's door shut behind him, "And you have been cooped up in there all afternoon. Sun would do you good. I have not seen your face all day."</p><p>Jason lets him go, and Tim tugs at the back of his tunic -</p><p>"You never told me that Bruce was the Dark Knight!" Tim whines, "<em>You never told me!</em>"</p><p>Jason raises an eyebrow, "Is that important?"</p><p>Tim lets out a strangled sound – "He is amazing! He is a legend! Can you tell me more? Could you translate?"</p><p>It is hard to translate the legends into Northern tongue, but they always tried to translate the Dark Knight's. For his adventures and battles were truly amazing and glorious and heart-racing. They were always Tim's <em>favorites</em>, and it always upset him how hard it was for the traveling bards to translate them because they lacked the equivalent words. The stories always had so much detail missing and Tim always wanted to know <em>more</em>.</p><p>Jason laughs, "I was young when we left Gotham. I do not know the stories any better than you do. I was only Bruce's ward for a few months before Talia came and took us here. You should ask Dick, next time. He was Bruce's ward for much longer than me."</p><p>Tim whines, "I can't believe you never <em>told</em> me."</p><p>"I cannot believe you are reacting the way you <em>are</em>."</p><p>-</p><p>"You are supposed to be in a council meeting." Tim says, opening his eyes to find Ra's standing over him. Tim yawns, sitting up as Ra's folds himself down on the roof next to him.</p><p>"Is it not, first and foremost, my greatest duty to see to the wellbeing of my one and only consort?" Ra's replies, "Perhaps you were born as the wrong creature, beloved one. In another life you might have been a bird or a cat, always climbing to such high places like this." Ra's touches Tim's cheek, "And always making that face, yes, I do believe you were a cat in another life."</p><p>Tim does like cats. Another one of the few bonuses of living in the South is that there are <em>lots of them</em>. Tim wrinkles his nose, turning his face away.</p><p>"It is quiet up here. Or. It <em>was</em>."</p><p>"If you keep acting like that, I might start to think that you do not enjoy my company." Ra's adjusts the fall of his robes, taking Tim's hand in his own. "You have been giving the servants a fright."</p><p>"They will get used to it. It is only the new ones, right?"</p><p>"Come down. There are a great many other places for you to find your peace. Places that would not get your clothes so dirty and would bring peace of mind to your watchers."</p><p>"Because I am <em>all</em> about the peace of mind." Tim sighs, "Fine. But only because if I did not agree you would stay up here and then <em>everyone</em> would be coming up here to nag at me."</p><p>-</p><p>There are an innumerable amount of Gods and Goddesses, spirits and lesser deities here. It's absolutely baffling and Tim wonders how one goes about their day without offending one of them. How so many can be attributed for so much and then spoken of so rarely.</p><p>There are no gods in the North. There are spirits whom you owe nothing to. You owe no devotion to any spirit, and in turn no spirit owes any love to you. You must earn their respect, their love, their favor. And you must work hard to be <em>worthy</em> of it, and to keep it.</p><p>There are the <em>hulgr</em> and the dragons, the spirit of the winds and the frost, there is mother-bear and the Twin-Ravens. There are many spirits, but in the end they do not demand your love. Your loyalty.</p><p>"But how do you not offend any of them?" Tim whispers as Cass nudges for him to bow. "Who is who? What offerings? What ceremony?"</p><p>"I do not know." Cass shrugs. "These are not my gods, either."</p><p>"Then who's <em>are they</em>?" Tim asks. Because they are not Jason's, either. They are not Dick's, or Bruce's, or Selina's. He has already asked.</p><p>"Have you asked Talia?"</p><p>"No." Tim does not speak with Talia. Mostly because he has never been in the same <em>room</em> as Talia for more than a few moments at a time. The woman is intimidating and always <em>busy</em>. Always on her way to do something, always coming and going.</p><p>"Ask her. She is well versed in the lore." Cass says, "She could tell you better than anyone. She makes many pilgrimages every year."</p><p>"Is that where she always goes?"</p><p>"Sometimes. I do not know. Mother and I do not always travel with her, and I do not go with her to the holy sites." Cass says, "The only ones I know are the sister-gods of dreams and despair, and the ram-god of time. They have the best stories."</p><p>Tim does not know these stories, but they interest him. He wishes that more of the stories the tutors teach are about the Gods and Goddesses, rather than the dumb nobles.</p><p>"Will you tell me?" Tim asks.</p><p>"Only if you tell me yours."</p><p>-</p><p>"It is not that I do not <em>understand</em>." Tim sighs, slumping down when Talia tells him <em>again</em>. Tim supposes he should be honored that the Princess is personally teaching him this. Just as the First Consort is also personally attending to his studies. But everyone knows it is only because all the other tutors have been driven to violence whenever they teach him, or because the only tutors he can stand have many other students and cannot give him the attention he demands. Tim should not feel proud about driving the tutors and trainers to their wits end – it only earns him the ire of the noble born – but then again Tim does not think that these tutors should look at him like a conquest. "I understand. It is just that I cannot do it <em>your way</em>. I already know <em>my</em> way and I think that if you could do it <em>my</em> way you would not be able to do it your way, either."</p><p>"I am only asking for fire, Tim." Talia says, "What is so hard about that?"</p><p>"Nothing." Tim mutters, "But you are asking me for things that I do not have to do. I already know how to do fire. And it is like <em>this</em>." Tim twitches his fingers and brings fire into his palm.</p><p>"You are skipping the steps."</p><p>"The steps are not necessary for me."</p><p>"Without the steps there is room for error."</p><p>"But it is not a <em>short cut</em>." Tim protests, "It is simply a different <em>way</em>."</p><p>Talia hums, tapping her fingers together before tilting her head. "Tell me about your way, Tim. Since we seem to be at a crossroads. What is your way? What do you <em>mean</em> by your way?"</p><p>Tim frowns, "I just." Tim waves his hand to dispel the flame, "That is it. I just. Have to <em>do</em>."</p><p>"Yes, I understand that much. But for complicated things – like this." Talia opens the book to one of the more complex spells in the back before turning it towards him. "Can you read this?"</p><p>"Parts of it." Tim says. It is still hard for him to read seals. They all seem to blend in to each other and Tim never really knows when to stop breaking them down and when to keep the components whole. "This is – barrier? Wall? Aether?"</p><p>"A shield against magic attacks." Talia says, holding her hands up and whispering the incantation. The air around her shimmers, like a dragon fly's wing – rainbow and translucent all at once. "Like this.  How would you do this?"</p><p>"I – I do not know." Tim has never seen magic like this before. Many of the spells of the South are strange to him.</p><p>"Then how do you guard against magic?" Talia frowns, Tim shrugs.</p><p>"What kind of magic?" Tim frowns, "Fire? Ice? Earth? Spirit? All you have to do is deflect it using the opposing or negating element, right?"</p><p>Talia hums, tapping her fingers on the table before flipping to another page in the book.</p><p>"Alright – how about this. If you want to move something, say – if I were to ask you to move the flower in that bowl from that side of the room to here without touching it – how would you do it?"</p><p>"I would manipulate the water and the air to carry it over."</p><p>"And if I were to ask you to extinguish a lantern?"</p><p>"I would smother the flame or I would call a wind."</p><p>Talia hums, looking around the room, "How would you divine the future?"</p><p>Tim blinks, tilts his head, "Divine?"</p><p>"Tell, to foresee. To predict. Something like a – a prophecy?"</p><p>"What is a prophecy?"</p><p>Talia blinks, "Ah, now I think we are getting to the root of our problems. Wait here."</p><p>She stands, leaving the room. Tim blinks, shifts over a bit to pull the book of spells closer to himself, running his finger along the lines of sigils and seals. They are beautiful, even if they do not make any sense to him. Even if he cannot read them properly, Tim can appreciate how beautiful they are.</p><p>This country is, indeed, beautiful. It is not – it is not <em>bad</em>.</p><p>Tim thinks he could learn to love this country, someday.</p><p>When Talia returns she has another book with her and a sleeve for scrolls. She sets them down on the table.</p><p>"This is a prophecy." Talia says, unscrewing the scroll sleeve and pulling out an aged and worn roll of parchment. "It predicts that something will happen, to who, and to what extent. Some may be more specific, some may be very vague. They are told by people who – through a study of stars, flowers, bones, or some other sort of medium – have glimpsed into the future."</p><p>"How? The future – <em>how</em>?" Tim frowns, leaning over the table to look at the script. "The future is not real. How can you know the future when you do not know the present?"</p><p>Talia turns to look out the window, "Well, Tim – do you think it will rain today?"</p><p>Tim blinks, startled by the strange change in topic – "No."</p><p>"Why do you think that?"</p><p>"Because there are no clouds."</p><p>"It could be a flash rain."</p><p>"But the air is dry."</p><p>"Why is the air dry?"</p><p>"Because it is the wrong time of the month."</p><p>"And so you think that it will not rain today?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"And you knew that because there were no clouds, and the air is dry, and it is not the right time of the month for it."</p><p>"Yes." Tim blinks, frowns, "But – that is not the same. Is it?"</p><p>"I do not know. I do not have the talent to divine meaning like the seers do. But these are prophecies. Those who can see them are called prophets, or seers. Fortune tellers and soothsayers, depending on where you come from. Sometimes they are oracles and priests, priestesses. I am guessing you do not have something like that."</p><p>"My blood-sister has visions." Tim says, "Gifted to her by the Twin-Ravens after she gave her eye to <em>Ymir</em> in her tenth year." Tim bites his lip. "But her visions are of the spirits, and they are not of people or this world. They are – they are meant for spirit. Not for flesh."</p><p>"And sometimes prophecies can do that as well." Talia replies. "So – I see. You do not have these. And therefore you do not have the words for it. I think I am beginning to understand the differences between our magics, Tim. And I think I can understand why our concepts of incantations are so hard for you."</p><p>Tim perks up, looking up at her – Talia smiles.</p><p>"You only know the elements, frost-born. The elements that you live side by side with, and the spirits that represent them. It is what we call <em>wild magic</em>. It is primal, raw, and the hardest to control. We have many elemental spells, but they are all very hard. Advanced in a way. They need more words, more refinement. In contrast our spells are based on the mind and spirit. Like this shield spell. It is not physical, it is not raw – but it is something <em>not</em>. Something <em>other</em>. Not of this plane." Talia leans forward and smiles, "Now. Since we have that sorted out, let us figure out what else is getting lost in translation, shall we?"</p><p>-</p><p>Of all the many gods, goddesses, deities, and other such things in the south, Tim has ever really only come to appreciate a small handful of them.</p><p>There is one, in particular, he gives offerings to and does his best to worship. The idea of worship is new to him, but he thinks that over the years he has done well enough at it. He likes to think that the goddess has even granted him her favor.</p><p>Every morning of the waning crescent moon, as the early dawn light starts to wash the stars from the sky, Tim goes onto his balcony and lays out the few things he has managed to get from the North.</p><p>The small, ritual dagger carved out of stone from the veins of the giant's-blood-mountains, a wooden bowl carved from white-wood and inlaid with glittering she-drake scales. Antler pieces of an elder aurel and feather of a dying thunderbird.</p><p>Tim draws a thin line over the back of his arm, thin enough to bead. And he smears the blood with the feather of the thunderbird, and fills the bowl with clear liquor. Tim whispers the prayers and incantations that invoke the spirit of Selardi – one of the goddesses of the moon. To the southerners, Selardi is fickle and she is wicked. But she is loyal to those who pray to her, and she will guide them through moon-less nights.</p><p>In the North, it is believed that moon-less nights are death-nights. The cold ones creep to steal the frost-born out of their bodies, and to drag them into the depths. Moon-less nights are when the restless dead cry and suffer most, without the light of <em>Ymir's</em> eye to gaze upon them.</p><p>So Tim prays to Selardi, to guard the dead and to guide the ones he loves through the close of <em>Ymir's eye</em>.</p><p>Tim tosses the aurel antlers for her, and drinks the wine and drinks in her name as the sun crests the sky.</p><p>And prays to her for his loved ones to come home.</p><p> </p>

</p><p>The tradition, upon completing and mastering their <em>hammrammr</em>, is for the new <em>berserkr</em> to go and seek out tokens of favor from the ones who first came to them during their first <em>hammask</em>.</p><p>But Tim is bound to the South and the Immortal King, so he cannot journey back to the frosts of the north to seek out a mother-dragon and he cannot return to the remains of his mother's stead to appease the sister-<em>hulgr</em> of the land. He could ask Slade or Rose to bring him something, he thinks. But it is not right. It is not the way, and it would not count.</p><p>The entire point of it is to show how well your <em>hammrammr</em> has been mastered to those who gave it to you.</p><p>So Tim makes do with what he has.</p><p>Tim has been sneaking out of the palace walls since he was ten. To complete his vendettas, and then to help those who have asked favors of him, those who have helped him in turn, and those he has come to see as <em>his people</em>.</p><p>It is not hard to disappear for a few hours a night, or even from curfew till morning chores.</p><p>But Tim does not think that he will be able to find one of the southern <em>wyverns</em> or find whatever a <em>hulgr</em> is in the south in such a short amount of time.</p><p>Tim sighs as he makes his way over rooftops to Harper's house, satchel of fruit over his shoulder and a wineskin at his hip. He really should not be sneaking them this food, but you only live once and he figures that they deserve this much for helping him.</p><p>"You know," Harper says when he crawls in through her window, depositing his bounty on her table, "I heard that stories of a ruby-scale towards the west of the Imperial city. You could try looking there. It would not be so far."</p><p>"What is a ruby-scale doing so far east?" Tim asks, waving to Cullen when he enters the room. "I thought the ruby-scales come from the Western countries. They like mountains."</p><p>"They also like gold." Cullen replies, giving Tim a nervous smile. "If you are going, we can get a horse for you. A cuatl, if you are willing to wait."</p><p>"How are you going to get your hands on a cuatl?" Tim raises an eyebrow, "If you get caught I am not going to break you out of prison."</p><p>"Yes you are." Harper snorts. Cullen smirks. "When have you <em>not</em>? You are a bleeding heart."</p><p>Tim sighs, "Fine, I would break you out. But maybe I would let you sit for a while. How are you going to get your hands on a cuatl?"</p><p>"You have your secrets, frost-born, we have ours." Cullen replies, "So are you going?"</p><p>"Yes. But I would rather take a horse. A cuatl is too much of a threat. And I would rather you two not get your heads cut off your necks because I asked you to get me one." Tim says. "Where is, this ruby-scale, exactly, and what whispers have you heard of it?"</p><p>-</p><p>Seven months after becoming the High Consort, Tim is poisoned. It is a surprise, to say the least. He had thought that if there were no assassination attempts when he was the Commander, and if there were none in the first few weeks after the announcement, and if there were none after the first two months of being High Consort, then there would not be any at all.</p><p>"This is a surprise." Tim says, mouth growing numb as the wine dish slips from his tingling fingers and crashes to the floor. Ra's seizes him as he starts to fall, and Tim takes a moment to think that he must look incredibly stupid – like a swooning maiden – and he will never live this down.</p><p>Tim's lips are numb, and his throat feels like its closing. Tim's vision blurs, and Ra's face seems to smear – distorting, his features disappearing into spots of color, all of it blending together and moving at once – above him. Tim can no longer feel his fingers and he is rapidly losing feeling in his arms.</p><p>He is no longer sure of <em>where</em> his hands are, actually -</p><p>Tim closes his eyes – or at least he thinks he closes them, he must have closed them because he is not seeing anything – and he thinks that he is being lifted.</p><p>There is still sound, but Tim's mind seems to not want to translate anymore. There are sounds and words, he is sure. There is also movement, but Tim cannot discern what any of it is.</p><p>He thinks that he is moving for quite some time before he is being set down. He can no longer feel his hands, or half of his face, and breathing is starting to become something of a challenge. It is worrying, that it feels like something is sitting on his chest – and for a moment Tim is afraid that a <em>mara</em> has come to take him. But there are no <em>mara</em> in the south – only the incubi and succubi that Tim has only heard of as court excuses.</p><p>Tim tries to raise his hand to his throat, tries to breathe, but cannot, and it takes so much effort to open his eyes.</p><p>When he does finally manage, he can see Jason leaning over him, hair mussed and mouth drawn tight with concern -</p><p>He speaks, but Tim cannot understand. And he must close his eyes again.</p><p>For the first time in his life, Tim thinks -</p><p><em>It is so cold</em>.</p><p>-</p><p>"You are family, of course Helena and Damian are welcome in the Consort's Garden." Tim says, frowning, "They were raised here, why would I close the doors to them?"</p><p>"It is within your rights as the High Consort." Bruce says, both of them watching the four-year old princess as she chases after one of the royal cuatls that wander the King's Garden, and usually nest within the Consort's Gallery. "No one would blame you."</p><p>"No. It is their home as much as it is mine, now." Tim replies. "Besides, it is good for them to be able to come here. It is – it is peaceful."</p><p>The Consort's Gardens are beautiful and quiet. They feel untouched by time, by strife. By anything at all, really. Tim sits back against the soft cushions, and listens to the sound of the bubbling fountains and the songbirds that nest within the branches of the exotic trees that shade the garden floor. There are a great and many exotic creatures, to him at least, in the south. And the most beautiful and rare of them can be found here.</p><p>Tame and not tame.</p><p>Beautiful and deadly.</p><p>Foreign and yet not.</p><p>Like Tim.</p><p>Tim sees the glitter of one of the star-wings darting through the underbrush, he reaches out a hand, clicking his tongue. Tim smiles as it pokes its head out of the bushes, slither-crawling over to nose against his fingers before quickly climbing onto his lap and presenting its belly like a child. Tim rests his hands on the soft scale-skin and feels its small little heart hammering against his palm. It coos at him, yawning, toes curling – the fine and colorful membranes of its fins and wings rippling before tucking against his belly for a nap.</p><p>"This is a beautiful place." Bruce says, getting up to go after Helena. "I am – I am glad you have come to see that, Tim. I am glad that you have grown to love this realm as much as I do."</p><p>Looking into this man, who was once a myth, a legend, a hero, a teacher, a mentor – and now a friend, and almost-father. Tim thinks that yes.</p><p>He loves this realm.</p><p>He loves these people.</p><p>"As am I."</p><p>-</p><p>When Damian is born the entire Kingdom celebrates. A new heir for the house of the Immortal King, the first son of the Princess. A boy born with both the blood of the al Ghul flame and the Dark Knight of Gotham.</p><p>"A real heir to the throne." Cass says, from where they are watching the celebrations from above. Jason went off to find them some more drinks, and Tim shifts a little to sit closer to her. "I admit to feeling relieved. The King is called the Immortal King for a reason – but. Well. Talia only ever reigns during the times when he steps down or must leave the state. Talia is more of his voice and hand abroad, and she has denied her birthright. It would have fallen to either Jason, Dick, or myself. Dick would have denied because he is a traveller and a diplomat. Jason would have said no because he is a soldier. That would only leave me and I would not wish to rule."</p><p>"What if this boy does not wish to rule, either?"</p><p>"Then I suppose we should not try to test out just how true this title of <em>Immortal</em> is." Cass says. "Long live the King."</p><p>They both look to where the royal family is seated, and touch their fingers to their lips.</p><p>"Long live the King."</p><p>-</p><p>In his training as Commander for the King's army, Tim is removed from the same training as his peers altogether. For the most part, his days are occupied with trailing after various members of the royal family.</p><p>Most often, this is the King, who is the only member of the royal family who is ever consistently in the city.</p><p>When they are around, Tim shadows the consorts or the Princess. Bruce is Tim's favorite to shadow, because the man is very good at making the experience something new for him every time. He has always been Tim's favorite teacher. When Tim shadows Bruce, he learns a great many things about being a foreign-born soldier. Bruce was, after all the lord of Gotham and the Dark Knight of the West.</p><p>Most of Bruce's days are filled with research on tactics and strategy, as well as tinkering in his workshop. Tim learns to make all sorts of interesting things, the names of things like <em>hydrocarbon</em> and <em>basalt</em>. He reads a lot of books on chemistry and alchemy, astronomy and biology while Bruce works. And he also learns a great many stories about Bruce's adventures as the Dark Knight.</p><p>At the end of most days, Bruce goes to report to the King. And Tim is fairly sure that if the man were not the Princess' first consort, that he would have been named the Commander in Tim's place. It must irk Ra's' official advisors that it is the First Consort's words that drive the Princess' blade and the King's armies over theirs.</p><p>And someday it will be Tim's.</p><p>But Bruce is rarely in the capitol – for he is also the Lord of Gotham and frequently returns to his home to deal with matters of state there. Selina usually goes with him, for she is the Lady of Gotham and usually when one is in the Imperial City the other is abroad.</p><p>When Tim shadows Selina, he learns a great many things about court life from a woman's perspective. Tim learns jewels and he learns gossip. Tim learns the codes of the bath-houses and he learns flower-arranging and how flowers carry their own messages. He learns a great many things, so many that he feels like he is versed in a language of his own.</p><p>Selina introduces him to many courtiers, concubines, and other such women. She introduces him to the mistresses and bastards and former wives of nobles. He makes a great many allies among them, and it feels like a strange sort of – a sort of group that he is now privy to. When he passes them in the city, and they nod at him, it feels like Tim is aware of something very powerful, something very great.</p><p>They know so many things, after all. And they are more than willing to share with him.</p><p>Tim learns that there are a very few people who actually like the current nobility, the current wealthy. It is not just his fellow foreign-born, his fellow former-slaves who thrive on speaking ill about these fat-fingered fools behind their backs.</p><p>Their wives are just as happy to gossip about their lord-husbands as they are to gossip about each other.</p><p>Tim has only shadowed Shiva a few times – mostly he ends up with Cassandra. Cassandra tells him that Shiva did not want to become Talia's consort. She hated the idea and she hated the woman, but what she hated more was that she was bested in combat. In the end, the two gained a grudging respect for each other that turned into the strange relationship they have today.</p><p>Shiva is Talia's sword, and is often traveling to spread word of the royal family's power through her victories in combat.</p><p>Occasionally he ends up as guard to Damian – but the boy is eight and there is not much that he can get up to on his own, and he is usually in lessons.</p><p>In the end Tim finds himself shadowing the King on most days. It is a learning experience.</p><p>Some days the King treats him as a true shadow, as if he is part of the room. Other days he drags Tim into the oddest conversations, and during some council meetings he will turn to address Tim directly and have him speak. It is odd and a little annoying. But it is a good learning experience. Tim learns much about how this country runs, and how the politics of it work.</p><p>Tim is uncertain how he will use all the tools he is gaining follow the royal family when he is appointed the Commander. But he is sure that there will be a use for it.</p><p>-</p><p>When Tim is sixteen, Selina becomes pregnant with Bruce's child. It is – an uproar, to say the least.</p><p>"The babe will have no true royal flesh." Jason says as they go through morning stretches. "But they will be close to the throne and a good marriage match. She has no southern flame in her, though. It is most likely she will end up joining the guard like I did. Or perhaps becoming a foreign dignitary, like Dick."</p><p>"What about the babe's flame ceremony? Is it not customary for children of the noble houses to take them?" Tim asks, stretching his hands towards the sky.</p><p>"Yes, but not all noble children do it. And she is not really flesh of the royal line, so it would not be odd for her not to – "</p><p>"But you did it. The members of the King's house always take the flame." Tim replies, "That is why so many of them are <em>dead</em>."</p><p>Jason winces – "Or addled."</p><p>They both shudder. Tim is glad that Jason was excused from taking the rite by technicality. After all, Bruce was not of the Immortal King's house when Jason became his ward.</p><p>Here, the rite of passage is not to kill. It is not a journey, a hunt, a challenge, or even gaining a token of favor. It is not widely practiced, either.</p><p>The rite of passage here is the acceptance of a noble flame. It is practiced by nobles alone, and even then it is rare for the nobles to undertake the rite. The only family who consistently takes the rite is that of the King's line.</p><p>It is a deadly rite.</p><p>Many go mad. Tim wonders how many of the Immortal King's line have burned to death.</p><p>Though the ones who have survived it are worthy of the name.</p><p>"No child of Bruce's and Selina's could fail." Tim says, "They are strong, their babe will be strong."</p><p>"Yeah." Jason says, "Let us pray."</p><p>-</p><p>The way of the <em>berserkr</em> is not to kill those who have given them their <em>hammrammr</em>.</p><p>Tim finds the ruby-scale quite easily. The she-dragon is large, and her belly gleams with the hard, plate-like scales that distinguish the great dragons of the west from the ones everywhere else. She looks at him with one of her great, molten gold eyes and steams -</p><p>"And what a little one, so far from home. A frost-born in flame-skin. And why do you chase my shadow, child-of-my-kin?" The ruby-scale taunts, her great mass moving and rustling against the still-warm earth.</p><p>Tim prostrates himself on the hot ground before her, "Great-one, sister-kin to the dragons of the frost and thunder, horn-sister, I come before you to seek your pride." Bound as he is, he cannot give her the respect she deserves by showing her his horns. He cannot truly activate the <em>hammask</em> to enter <em>hammrammr</em>. But even bound like this, he can still summon frost and thunder. Slade has taught him well. Tim calls lightning to his skin, feels it lighting him up from the inside, and feels the earth underneath his skin start to chill. The electricity rumbles through him, making his skin tingle and his bones hum.</p><p>"O-<em>ho</em>." The ruby-scale says, her great neck extending and arcing as she looms over him, "Sheltered in sister-dragon's wings, carried upon her breath, are you?"</p><p>"I am Timothy, flesh-born of Janet Wyvern-Slayer, and Jack-Deep-Darkness-Dweller. I have the <em>seithr</em> of <em>berserkrs, </em>and your sister-dragon's wings sang my <em>seithr</em> to life, and the sister-<em>hulgr</em> drew me out of my blood. I seek your favor, great-one. Though I cannot bow my horns to you, and I cannot sing-speak in this skin, I would ask your blessing."</p><p>The she-dragon laughs, and her voice is deep and grating and sends a wave of heat through the air. The language of dragons is not kind, and the air fills with her scorn as she fans out her great wings.</p><p>"Bound and brought low, and you still have the balls to call yourself a master of the dragon-blood?" She snarls, tail lashing as she gets to her feet. Tim's focuses on keeping his heart steady – and perhaps he should have <em>not</em> approached one of the most aggressive and violent dragon-kin known to man – "You dare? <em>Who are you, unworthy one, to speak of my blessing?"</em></p><p>Tim bites his cheek, "I am Timothy. I am Tim. Blood-bound to Jason. Blood-bound to the Terminator, Slade, and the Ravager, Rose. I am the to-be-Commander of the King's army."</p><p>The dragon rises above him, heat and shadow and a tangible weight of <em>seithr</em> -</p><p>"I have traveled the lands under the King's gaze and taken vendetta on those who have wronged me. And one day this country will submit to me." Tim raises his eyes to look into the ruby-scale – "I will bring the King to his knees."</p><p>And the she-dragon roars.</p><p>-</p>

</p><p>"Where do you think you would be, if it were not for me?" Ra's asks, tilting Tim's face up with his fingers. Tim raises an eyebrow -</p><p>"If it were not for <em>you</em>? Your arrogance knows no bounds." Tim snorts.</p><p>Ra's makes a bemused expression, "Was it not I who spared your life and made you both my blade and my beloved?"</p><p>Tim clicks his tongue, pushing Ra's' hand away as he turns to settle himself over Ra's' folded legs.</p><p>"It was the raiders – now dead and rotting – who brought me low." Tim points out, running his fingers over the intricate ties and golden brocade on Ra's' chest. "As I recall it – it was not <em>you</em> who leveled my mother's stead, nor was it you who tore me out of the ice. It was not you who branded me like chattel, and bound and dragged me into the South. Come to think of it – it was not you who branded me a murderer, or you who's blood has now wet the earth and disappeared like the aether." Tim taps a finger to his lips in mock thought, "You know – it was not even you who taught me to speak this tongue. Or to dress as these Southerners do. <em>Hm</em>. When I think about it – it was not you who <em>brought</em> me to the Imperial City!" Tim grins, "Nor was it you who healed my injuries. How <em>odd</em> – did you – "</p><p>Ra's clicks his tongue, pulling at Tim's hair. "It was I who stayed the executioner's blade, and it was I who made sure you were not whipped for your insolence, barbarian."</p><p>"But you stayed the executioner's blade, not for me – but for Bruce who brought me to your attention. And it was not out of concern for my wellbeing that you kept me safe from the ire of the tutors and trainers and nobles, but out of love for your daughter and her consort, as I had become Jason's only companion." Tim points out. "And at every turn it was <em>my</em> choice to say <em>yes</em>. Was it not?"</p><p>"Did you ever really have a choice, I wonder." Ra's hums, running his thumb over Tim's brow, where his horns would crest and begin to curve if he were in his frost-flesh. "Yes, yes. I had little hand in the road you have traveled until now. But tell me, do you ever wonder what your life would have been like?"</p><p>"If it were not for the dead? If it were not for Jason and Dick, Bruce and Selina, Cassandra and Talia?" Tim leans into the touch, eyes sliding closed. "What is the point in thinking of what-ifs when there is the present before me? It is a frivolous waste of time."</p><p>"My time is never wasted on you, most beloved one. Humor me. If you were not brought low – where do you see yourself?"</p><p>Tim hums, twining his fingers together and resting his head on Ra's' chest. He can feel the heat of Ra's' <em>seithr</em> through the layers of cotton and silk, taste it. Tim draws the rune for <em>perfect one</em> and <em>completed</em> with his forefinger, and the <em>seithr</em> seems to sing with contentment. Tim turns his smile into Ra's' chest -</p><p>"I would be back on my mother's stead. And perhaps I would have mastered my <em>hammrammr</em>, perhaps I would have never realized I had the <em>seithr</em> for it." Tim closes his eyes and imagines it – a world in which the thunder of the mother-dragon does not beat with his heart, and the sister-<em>hulgr's </em>breath is not his own. "I would have survived my coming of age."</p><p>That, Tim knows without a doubt. He knows it in his flesh, in his blood – he would not have failed. It is certain. He was always favored by their land – <em>hulgr-touched, </em>horn-crowned, <em>Ymir</em>-loved.</p><p>Mother had said – "We named you <em>Timothy</em>, he who honors the gods. For if you honor them they shall love you, and truly you are a blessed gift to us."</p><p>"I do not think I would have become a challenger or a champion." Tim says after a moment's thought – "I think that I would have liked to work with <em>seithr</em>. I would have become the shield-bearer of the sister-hulgr, or I would have found an honored dragon to pledge myself to." Tim opens his eyes, "Perhaps I would have become the voice of the well of <em>Ymir</em>, or perhaps I would become a wise one, in time. Who knows?"</p><p>Tim raises himself up onto his elbows, "And perhaps I might have died that day. Or perhaps I would have been broken. At this moment, I could be someone else's bed-slave. Or their beast. Their battle-pet in a fighting ring. Or I could be used to breed more slaves, or other such things."</p><p>A dip forms between Ra's' brows, and Tim reaches out to touch it. Ra's takes Tim's hands in his own, bringing them to his lips.</p><p>"The thought of you brought so low – " Ra's sighs, and Tim replaces his hands with his own mouth. The Immortal King always tastes of <em>seithr</em>. Not just magic, but the pure, raw and charged <em>energy</em> of all things. The air around him sings with it. And touching his lips to Ra's is like being drowned in it. It is breath taking and makes Tim's pulse race.</p><p>Ra's opens his mouth for him, and Tim takes him in. Takes in the taste of his <em>seithr</em>, and takes in the sharp bite of the fruit Ra's was eating, the bitter-dull scent of wine – Ra's' fingers run through Tim's hair, catching on the trinkets that are woven-braided into his hair every morning.</p><p>Since becoming High Consort, Tim has grown his hair out. It curls around his ears, and hangs into his eyes. It is annoying and gets in the way – but it feels so very good, when people run their hands through it. It is soothing, calming. And for that reason Tim does not cut it back to the military neatness it once was.</p><p>Apparently, it also makes him look <em>softer</em>. Kinder. Tame.</p><p>Tim laughs into Ra's' mouth at the thought, "Why – where do you think I would be if it were not for you and your prick?" Tim tilts his head, running his thumb over Ra's' cheek. "Where do you suppose I would be?"</p><p>Ra's clicks his tongue. "You tease me and mock my affections for you, beloved one, treating my honest inquiries as if they were made in jest."</p><p>"They <em>are</em> ridiculous inquiries." Tim says, "To ask after what never was and will never be, when there are so many other more <em>pressing</em> matters at hand."</p><p>-</p><p>It does not take Tim very long to build his network – or at least, not as long as it took him to climb ranks to become the Commander. But to be fair, Tim has been setting up these pieces for a very long time.</p><p>(Even if he did not know what he was doing, at the time.)</p><p>"Jason is my hand," Tim tells Cassandra as they travel the city in palanquins. The shadows cast by the intricate lattice work frame her face as she turns away from the view to him. "You are neither a King's guard, nor a diplomat. You are neither allied with the King or the Princess, or any of the other consorts. I would ask you to be my blade."</p><p>"I would have thought you would want it the other way around." She says, her dark eyes boring into him. "Jason has always been both your shield and sword."</p><p>"Jason is my shield, and he is my sword, yes. But he is also my voice and he is my most-loved blood-brother." Tim holds his hand out to her, "I am not blind to my blood-brother's flaws. I would take you as my blood-sister, if you wished it."</p><p>Cass grips her forearm in his, a warrior's grip. Her teeth glimmer in the light.</p><p>"It honors me to be the High Consort's blade. I am the first."</p><p>No other Consort has tried what he is going to achieve.</p><p>Tim smiles back at her, and allows his eyes to bleed their original colors, and allows a shadow of his self to peer past the southern guise he wears.</p><p>"Tonight, we exchange blood." Tim says, "Tonight we become blood."</p><p>Jason is the first. Cassandra is not the second.</p><p>But she is the one who makes Tim a <em>threat</em>.</p><p>-</p><p>"Harper? Harper – are you here?" Tim calls out, cautious as he eases his way past the make-shift door into the cramped and dirty room. The last time he had managed to track her down in the city, she had told him that this was one of her many haunts.</p><p>"Not so loud." Harper's voice calls out, rising from behind a pile of rags. "Any news?"</p><p>"No. I am sorry. I have heard no news of Cullen, nor have any of the slaves I have spoken to seen him." Tim answers, shaking his head as he hands her his satchel. "But I come with drink and meat. And a surprise. So I hope that this can cheer you up."</p><p>"A bringer of gifts." Harper says, perching on a crate and patting the space next to her. "Share this meal with me?"</p><p>Tim shakes his head. "I have already eaten. And there is not much, I am afraid."</p><p>It is very hard for Tim to sneak food out of the kitchens. Especially as often as he does. But he cannot help it. There are many mouths to feed, after all.</p><p>"I have something for you." Tim reaches into his tunic and pulls out the small mirror that he had convinced Dick to make for him. "It is an invention by Bruce, the Princess' First Consort – it can show the viewer the holder of similar mirrors, and can even send messages."</p><p>A few minutes into Tim's explanation on how the device works, Harper snorts and snatches it out of his hand -</p><p>"I can do better."</p><p>Tim blinks at her, mouth hanging open as she starts inspecting it – she smirks.</p><p>"Doubt me?"</p><p>Tim closes his mouth, "You think you can best the First Consort?"</p><p>"I do not <em>think</em>." Harper says, straightening her shoulders, "I <em>know</em>. Next time you come around, I will show you. I will have made better ones than these."</p><p>Tim grins, "I look forward to it."</p><p>-</p><p>It is – it is a quiet realization. It comes to him, slowly, softly. And it strikes him dumb, when it fully settles over him. This – this realization of <em>feeling</em>.</p><p>Of <em>wholeness</em>.</p><p>They are in his rooms in the Consort's Gallery. All the floor length windows are thrown open to let in the afternoon sun. Tim is lying on the rugs, among the several pillows, and playing with the small <em>sagittarius</em>-<em>panteras</em> that were recently born to the royal stables. Their bellies are round and soft, and their heads are covered in such fine, soft down. They peep and squeak and close their beaks and their fore-claws around his jewelry and clothes, attempting to climb over him and explore everything.</p><p>Tim keeps them close by bribing them closer with scraps of meat. They are still unsteady on their feet, their wings awkwardly flailing in the air as they tumble and fall over each other.</p><p>Ra's is reading by the windows, his low desk set up for him to work.</p><p>The King will often come here to work when his own rooms get too stifling, when his advisors and various council members are too overbearing for him to stand. Tim does not mind.</p><p>It feels natural, it feels <em>right</em>, for Ra's' work, his things, to be scattered around Tim's rooms.</p><p>He has a book there, a half-finished scroll there. Old versions of a speech, crossed out and heavily edited on that table. A map that he had been drawing folded there. That is a pillow from one of his sitting rooms. Those are some of his robes. And those fruits that are on the table are some of his favorites.</p><p>The rug that Tim lies on is one taken from Ra's' rooms. The jewels on Tim's wrist were taken from Ra's' wardrobe.</p><p>The air itself, when Tim opens his vision, is charged with the jade-amber-white of Ra's' <em>seithr</em>. Tim opens his mouth to taste the air, and yes. Yes. The air is indeed heavy with the taste of it. His heat. His <em>seithr</em>. It mixes with Tim's – and Jason's, to an extent. But the air tastes overwhelming of <em>Ra's</em> and <em>himself</em>.</p><p>He can taste the smell of flowers, the light touch of the mid-day heat, the perfume he wears. He can taste the birds in the gardens and the slight touch of the star-wings that like to come into his rooms because they know he will spoil them with fruits.</p><p>But it is undeniable that Ra's' scent is predominant.</p><p>Tim watches the man write. He has a steady hand. A beautiful hand, and in reading his script and his seals, Tim can get lost in the fine loops and thick curves that seamlessly bleed into each other. Tim could just watch Ra's write for <em>hours</em>.</p><p>Tim opens his mouth, and the word that has never fallen from his lips seems to just spring out of his mouth -</p><p>"Ra's." Tim says, and something inside him. Something inside him just loosens, warms, softens when Ra's looks up at him, waiting. Tim gently pulls the <em>sagittarius-panteras </em>off of him, setting them aside before rising. "Ra's."</p><p>He sheds his southern skin as he sheds the various shawls and silks that cover his shoulders, the <em>seithr</em> in the air changing as Tim charges it with his own. Tim can taste-see-feel Ra's' interest, his curiosity, his <em>seithr</em> -</p><p>And Tim folds himself onto his knees at Ra's' side – repeats – "Ra's."</p><p>Tim takes the Immortal King's face into his hands and looks into him. Looks into him with all the sight he has, calling forth the dragon in his blood and the <em>hulgrfolk</em>ein his flesh. He looks deep into Ra's' <em>seithr</em>, tasting it in the air and drawing it into his self.</p><p>"<em>Seele</em>." Tim whispers, closing his eyes and seeing the imprint of Ra's' soul on the back of his eyes.</p><p>Ra's' hands are warm on his skin, as he traces over Tim's arms and cups his elbows. "Timothy."</p><p>It is the first time that Ra's has used his name – for it has always been <em>barbarian</em>, and <em>boy</em>. It has been <em>my Blade, my Commander</em>. It has been looks and touches, and the weight of his gaze that call Tim forward. It is <em>my beloved one.</em> It is <em>habibi</em> and it is many things. But this, this is the first time –</p><p>The first time.</p><p>And Tim breathes out something that rattles itself loose in his chest, and he speaks and he does not know if Ra's knows all the words, if Ra's will understand -</p><p>For Ra's is capable of speaking in the tongue of the north, the tongue of dragons and frost. But Tim does not know if Ra's can truly <em>understand</em>. For he, in the end, is still a man born of the fire of the south.</p><p>"When the fire of your heart was poured into my veins, I did not think. When you placed your honor with mine, and when you tied our fates together, I did not think. When you took the flame of your house and gifted it to me, and when our <em>seithr</em> mixes, when our bodies are joined and when they are not joined, when we are apart and when you are near – I do not think. I have not thought in a long time." Tim takes one of Ra's' hands and presses it over his heart. "<em>Seele</em>. I – I have been poisoned in heart. I am torn between frost and flame. I said yes, to you and your flame. But I did not think. I did not understand. I thought that it was not <em>blood</em>. I did not think that it was what you call <em>love</em>. I thought it was not <em>always</em>."</p><p>Tim opens his eyes and sees the swirl of <em>seithr</em> and <em>heat</em> and <em>scent</em>.</p><p>"You sit here, before me, and you call my name and I come to you. I did not think. But now I do think, and I am afraid. You are warm and you taste right on my tongue, your name fits in my mouth and your hands fit in mine. The taste of your <em>seithr</em> fills my senses and I am warm and I am loved. I think and I am afraid. <em>Seele</em>. I have missed the ice and wind of the north for so long. But I would miss the taste of you, the scent of you more – I know. I know and the dragon in my veins sings me home and the mother-bear sends my heart away." Tim leans forward, and Ra's skin burns against his. "<em>Seele</em>. I have found my blood. I have come home."</p><p>Ra's' hand is soft, gentle, on the back of Tim's head, and he whispers back <em>ya'aburnee</em> against Tim's lips. The <em>seithr</em> charges around them like electricity and Tim sighs into Ra's' mouth and tastes <em>seithr</em> and <em>blood</em> and <em>home</em>.</p><p>They are blood. They are forever.</p><p>-</p><p>Tim has a large network of spies that expands over the entire continent. Rose and Slade who roam the North to bring him news of their fellow frost-born, of their wars and ever shifting borders and blood-ties. Harper and Cullen who have returned to the West, sending him news of the new discoveries, the new politics, the new magics that are always devouring each other to be reborn. Connor and Roy to the South among the islands, along with Kon-El of the floating kingdom of Krypton and Cassandra Sandsmark of the Amazons. To the East, Cassandra makes her name, following in the path of her mother, acting as Tim's blade as she cuts her way into the land of the Eternal Eda.</p><p>They send him their secrets, of which he feeds the court through servants rumors and planted among the loyal among the citizens.</p><p>But always, Tim has Ra's' ear, and Ra's' attention.</p><p>"And what has my beloved one learned today?" Ra's asks as Tim runs his finger over the crest of the hawk sent by Connor. Tim raises an eyebrow, tucking the parchment into his sleeves.</p><p>"Private correspondence." Tim replies, turning to watch the hawk move to glide down into the gardens to rest. "None of your business."</p><p>Ra's raises an eyebrow and Tim smiles, "How was court?"</p><p>"You very well know that it was a pain." Ra's replies, touching his fingers to Tim's brow, "You will give the servants a fright. Bearing your horns like this."</p><p>"Does it bother <em>you</em>?"</p><p>"If it did, I expect that you would do it more just to spite me." Ra's sighs, shaking his head. "No. It becomes you. You know it always pleases me to see you as you should be.  Are you well?"</p><p>"Yes." Tim replies, turning into Ra's' touch for a moment before leaning away. "I am better, now. Thank you."</p><p>"Your spies acted quickly to find the traitor among us." Ra's says. "Their efficiency is astounding."</p><p>"What spies? I know not of which you speak." Tim tosses his head, careful to avoid accidentally pricking Ra's' skin with his horns. Ra's gives him a fond smile as Tim slowly rises to make his way to his bed. He is still weak from the poison, and the fever and the drain on his magic that followed. Ra's' hands are strong as he holds Tim up and guides him. "I am but your High Consort, my King. I speak to no one but my fellow Consorts and few others. What spies could you possibly mean?"</p><p>Ra's clicks his tongue, sitting Tim up among the pillows and starts pulling off the jewels Tim is <em>still</em> forced to wear. Even when he has not left the confines of his rooms in the Consort's Gallery in well over a month. He wonders if he was still dressed for presentation to court when he was unconscious and fevered as well.</p><p>Tim blinks, tries to pull his hands away as Ra's starts pulling off Tim's rings – "What are you doing – "</p><p>"The fever has not left you addled. It is not comfortable for you to sleep in these. If anything you will end up marring your skin in your sleep."</p><p>"I can do it – " And if not Tim, there are the servants that seem to miraculously appear whenever Tim least expects them. Tim so loathes to have the servants do things he can very well do himself. But he is – he is very tired and it is a great relief not to have to take off all these burdensome clothes on his own. And for some reason the servants always seem so <em>delighted</em> to be of use to him when he is more than satisfied with just <em>speaking</em> to them. Hells, he has known most of them since he was a soldier in training.</p><p>"Allow me the pleasure of tending to my most beloved one." Ra's replies, calmly kneeling down to pull off the bells around his ankles. "You rarely allow me the honor of doting upon you, my blade."</p><p>Tim feels heat flush his cheeks as he weakly pushes at Ra's' shoulder.</p><p>"You are <em>embarrassing</em>. You are the <em>king</em>. Get <em>up</em>."</p><p>"I am also your husband." Ra's pushes aside the heavy folds of Tim's robes to kiss his bare knee, "What could possibly be embarrassing about this?"</p><p>"Your sheer brazen – " Tim groans and pushes the heels of his hands against his eyes, "For the love of – it is like arguing with a wall. You cannot possibly be good for my health."</p><p>Ra's hums, "Does that mean you do not want me to bathe you?"</p><p>"Please. Just shut up. <em>Please</em>."</p>

</p><p>The fever that takes him is hotter than anything he has ever experienced. Tim is only aware of the world in brief glimpses, small moments of lucidity that seem to blend in with everything else. Moments he does not recognize as being real at all.</p><p>Everything burns and Tim's mouth is so dry. It feels like his skin is cracking, bursting and blistering open. He wants water. It's so <em>hot</em>.</p><p>He dreams that his mother and father are with him. Mother is spooning broth into his mouth, and father carries him and rocks him back and forth like he is a babe again. Father rubs ice into his skin, and mother hum-chants images of ice-drakes and ice-bears. The sister-<em>hulgr</em> visits him, her wild-gold hair a splash of light in his eyes as she lifts him into her strong arms and kisses his face. His mother's blood-kin and his father's flesh-kin come to speak to him, to guide his spirit to heal the flesh and they sing-chant-weave thick chords in offering to the sister-<em>hulgr</em> to help him.</p><p>Tim has brief moments where he thinks he can hear Ra's' speaking. The words are a low and steady stream of sound that blend into each other, one word bleeding into the next. Like when he writes. He dreams that Jason holds him and whispers things that are northern and southern and western all at once.</p><p>He dreams many people come to see him.</p><p>But above all, Tim sees <em>seithr</em> – his <em>seithr</em>. It is sick and it is tainted. It is a murky gray, instead of the pale white-blue it should be, and even the brilliant jade-green of Lazarus has faded to a sickly yellow.</p><p>His skin feels like it is on fire, and whenever someone presses water to his lips it feels so <em>good</em>. But then it heats and burns and it scorches going down his throat.</p><p>Tim thinks he speaks, and he thinks he calls out to the mother-dragons of the north and the father-dragons that slumber in the depths of Ymir's spine. He prays for their cold flame, and he wishes for the touch of the sister-<em>hulgr</em> of his mother's stead.</p><p>(The sister-<em>hulgr</em> of his mother's stead was incredibly old for her kind. But she was strong and commanding, and they never ever missed a single gift-day to her. The sister-<em>hulgr</em> practically raised him in the woods surrounding their stead. She taught him how to use his horns, and she taught him to taste-see-hunt. Mac-<em>amme</em> was a strong woman. He misses her so much. He wonders who leaves her food on gift-days, and who braids chords for her made of soaked and purified oak-tree bark and strands of rabbit-leather. Tim promises himself that he will braid a ladder for her when he can, and send it to her through Slade or Rose.)</p><p>"Beloved one." Hands on his skin, it burns. It burns.</p><p>Tim's magic recoils and it churns inside of him. Tim breathes out, and the very air seems to burn the skin off his lips. He can feel the <em>hammrammr</em> of dragons inside of him, surging and overwhelming. It is too much, he needs to let it out, but he cannot. There is nowhere for the breath of the dragons to go – nowhere for the lightning to spark and nowhere for the thunder to shake. There is nowhere for his gift to release itself and Tim is so very tired.</p><p>"Hush, most beloved." Hands on his wrists, over the seals that have bound him since he was eight and blood-soaked and alone. Tim cannot see – but he can taste-smell Ra's. The glow of his <em>seithr</em>, the waves of his heat and his scent. Tim turns to it, and Ra's' hands cover the seals completely. "Quiet. Quiet, most beautiful one. Most fierce one. Hush."</p><p>Arms, strong arms lifting him. Tim turns his face, and his skin burns, but when he turns his face – it is skin. Ra's' skin. It is hot, but the feel of his <em>seithr</em> is comforting. A blanket that folds around him like freshly fallen snow and the arms of the sister-<em>hulgr</em> and the gentle wings of mother-dragon.</p><p>Tim whimpers, and the sound tears at his throat. He is being carried, and it is so hot. But it is not as hot – and Tim can taste water. He can taste water in the air.</p><p>He can hear it.</p><p>Tim can see the magic, the energy, of the water, see Ra's' <em>seithr</em> charging it, changing it – Tim can hear Ra's' speaking. Incantation. But Tim cannot understand, he cannot hear. He cannot see-feel-breathe.</p><p>His fingers are weak as he tries to grasp – to hold on. To something. Anything. To feel – Ra's' heartbeat, which tastes so strong and heavy on the back of Tim's tongue, but Tim cannot feel it with his hands.</p><p>Water. The sound of splashing.</p><p>Ra's' is still holding him, but there is water. So <em>close</em>. Ra's' is walking into water – so much water? Where – The Consort's Garden. The deep pool in the Consort's Garden. It must be, there is nowhere else -</p><p>Ra's holding Tim up against his chest, his mouth by Tim's ear as he takes Tim's wrists with one hand – "Quiet, ancient-born. Hush, most loved blade."</p><p>Ra's' <em>seithr</em>, his magic flowing through the seals that hold back the thunder and lightning and <em>hulgr-strength</em>. Tim rattles out something that might be a word as he feels Ra's' magic mixing with his own, flowing through the seals and unlocking them.</p><p>"<em>Rampage</em>." Ra's whispers as the final seal unlocks, and Tim <em>screams</em>.</p><p>-</p><p>It would not be unusual for the King to take lovers aside from the Consort.</p><p>Tim makes it clear that, while not unusual, it will not be tolerated. He is not nearly cruel enough to bring his wrath down upon the women and men brought before the King for that purpose. It is not their fault, and he cannot blame them for wanting to lie with the King of the realm.</p><p>He <em>can</em> however, blame the various nobles, merchants, and dignitaries who bring these people <em>forward</em> for the purpose of gaining the King's favor or attention with such antics.</p><p>Ra's is, as ever – either completely oblivious to such maneuverings, in which case they are so far beneath him that he no longer pays attention to them, or is keeping his opinion on the matter to himself, which would most likely mean that he is either waiting for the problem to resolve itself or for Tim to do something about it.</p><p>Tim definitely does something about it.</p><p>Especially considering that these men and women are paraded in front of the King to his <em>face</em>. It is either out of the hope that <em>one</em> of them is going to be attracted – or perhaps both, how is Tim supposed to know how these people think? – or because they think that Tim would not mind.</p><p>Tim turns his face towards Ra's' ear, voice low as he whispers his excuses to leave. Ra's' hand is flat on his thigh, and he inclines his head – "Shall I come with you?"</p><p>"No. Stay. Enjoy your – <em>entertainment</em>." Tim stands to leave, Jason slipping out of the shadows to follow behind him as Tim leaves the main reception hall to head back towards the King's chambers.</p><p>"That was brazen." Jason says, stepping forward to walk at Tim's side as soon as they are alone. Tim smiles, bumping his shoulder against Jason's as he sheds the façade of polite disinterest he wears at court. "Before you say anything, our people are already working on figuring out where she came from and who put her up to it. Cass already has a lead and is setting up some other opportunities for her as we speak."</p><p>"I like how you know what I want before I want it." Tim replies, "They must be getting desperate. Ever since we got the whores on our side they have been looking outside of the city for new faces."</p><p>"No one – whore or not – would be foolish to fuck the King in the Imperial City, little brother." Jason snorts, "Not where you can find them."</p><p>"Eventually they will learn that my limit is <em>not</em> the city." Tim replies, "I look forward to the day when these thick-headed fools realize that there is no one they can pay a high enough price to in the entire country to appear before the King with intent. Did they really think I would be passive about this?"</p><p>"I think that they hoped and I can see that hope dying out of their eyes." Jason ruffles Tim's hair, "Speaking about dying – I got a report from Roy. The southern isles are in conflict again.  He is requesting our help."</p><p>"Our as in the Immortal King?" Tim raises an eyebrow, he has heard no whispers of any of the various countries and lordships among the southern isles making a formal plea to the throne.</p><p>"More like <em>our</em> as in <em>your</em>." Jason says. "How do you wish to respond?"</p><p>"Roy and his flesh have been good to us." Tim says, "They are good shield-kin, and we owe them much. I would have you go personally, if it suits you. Cassandra has only just come back from her tour of the Eastern border, and it would not feel fair to send her out again so soon. Slade is in the middle of claiming land around my mother's stead, and Rose is in the middle of a pilgrimage through <em>Ymir's</em> bones. Dick would be too recognizable. Z has just been promote to Commander. I cannot afford to send Owens away from keeping watch on the Rows. Prudence is anything but subtle. Would you go?"</p><p>"Yes. I do not like leaving you by yourself, but it has been a while since I could stretch my legs." Jason answers, shrugging, "I will set out after this business is finished. Is there anything you want me to bring back as a present for you?"</p><p>"Your head." Tim snorts. "Just do not die and I will be satisfied. And send them my best wishes. And tell Connor that he should visit more."</p><p>-</p><p>Tim gains his token of a <em>hulgr</em> by complete accident. He does not ever expect to gain one, for the <em>hulgr</em> keep the North and a few select forests in the western countries. But they never venture below the frost-touched lands of <em>Ymir</em>.</p><p>There is no way that Tim can make the journey north to his mother's stead to ask Mac-<em>amme</em> for her favor, and he will not ask someone else to do it for him.</p><p>He does not expect for Mac-<em>amme</em> to send her token to <em>him</em>.</p><p>It happens in a dream, or something like a dream. There are few who could say that their spirits can walk the realms, and there are even fewer who claim to have mastery of it. Tim is not one of them. It is not in his flesh – from sire or dam – and to be honest, it is not something he ever considered. He is blessed enough to have the <em>hammrammr</em> and to be <em>Ymir-loved</em>.</p><p>The spirit-walkers are odd. Strange. Eerie.</p><p>On the night before Tim is to be promoted to Commander, Tim's spirit walks.</p><p>He dreams, and his spirit wakes to a land of snow. The land is familiar, even without the stone and leather and wood buildings that marked his mother's stead. His spirit walks the familiar land – the hides that held their insignia are gone. And what used to be his mother's hall is now a ruin of stone and snow.</p><p>Tim stands at the what used to be the great door, and he walks past what used to be their stables. Tim stands over the place where he hid as his parents were slaughtered. His heart feels heavy.</p><p>Tim wonders why he would have such an auspicious dream before such an important event tomorrow.</p><p>A light glimmers from the trees, and Tim looks up to see a flash of the sister-<em>hulgr's</em> eyes.</p><p>He follows.</p><p>Mac-<em>amme</em> and her children populate the forests around his mother's stead. But it is Mac-<em>amme</em> who speaks for them all.</p><p>She leads him to the clearing where she taught him to listen for rabbits and birds, where he would leave her offerings of badly woven ladders on gift-days.</p><p>She sits on the stones, tail curled around her thick waist as she beckons him forward. All the ladders he ever made for her are thrown around her thick shoulders.</p><p>"Timothy, frost-born babe, flesh of Janet and Jack, <em>Ymir-loved</em>." She calls him, and he falls into her like he is a small thing. Her great arms encompass him and she smells like warm milk and soft hay. Like damp leaves and fresh bread. She holds him against her bare chest, running her strong hands through his hair as she sing-chants him her happiness that he is alive.</p><p>"I am sorry." Tim says, "I cannot come to you."</p><p>"You live." Mac-<em>amme</em> says. "It is enough that you live. And you are even <em>hammrammr</em>! You received my gift in time – I was there. I saw. I could not come to help you. I am so sorry, my littlest frost-babe. I could not protect you."</p><p>"Did we anger you?" Tim asks. For he had wondered – he had wondered why Mac-<em>amme</em> and her <em>huldr-kin</em> did not come for them. For the <em>huldr-kin</em> are stronger than any raider on their home territory, able to bend iron hot from a forge in their bare hands, and crush bone with their heels. He looks into her soft eyes and she kisses his brow.</p><p>"No, frost-touched. The southern magic barred us from coming. We could only watch. But I felt the <em>berserkr</em> in you – and sent you my blessing. And hoped. You were so strong, <em>Ymir-loved</em>. I thought we would be able to keep you, but they took you away and we could do nothing for the dead or for you. The land wept." Mac-<em>amme</em> cups his face. "You are so grown, now, Timothy-frost-born. You do your kin proud."</p><p>She loops a ladder around his neck and begins to weave it closed. She sings about honor and the flight of dragons. The thunder of their wings, and the rumble of <em>Ymir's</em> stirrings. She weave-chants the taste of crisp autumn-apples and the howl of dire-wolves. Tim listens and he yearns, and the ladder is heavy around his shoulders. Glowing with <em>seithr</em>.</p><p>Tim feels the magic sinking into him, the <em>seithr</em> changing and binding to his own.</p><p>"A gift, frost-born. So that you never forget that you are <em>Ymir's</em>. That you are <em>ours</em>." Mac-<em>amme</em> says a Tim feel his spirit being drawn back to his body. "Always, frost-born. You may have been forged anew, but your metal and bone is ours."</p><p>When Tim wakes, he can feel it – wreathed about his shoulders, the blue-black-frost-touched woad of the <em>hulgr's </em>favor. Tim tugs at his tunic's collar, looking down at the intricate knots and braids made of <em>seithr</em> imprinted upon his skin. Tim watches them fade until he can no longer see them with his southern eyes.</p><p>If he could change forms, Tim knows he would be able to see them again. He brushes his fingers over the skin, and feels Mac-<em>amme's</em> <em>seithr</em>.</p><p>Searching inwards, Tim feels her <em>seithr</em> – the <em>seithr</em> of his mother's land settling with his own. Changing and mixing and blending along with the <em>seithr</em> he received from the ruby-scale.</p><p>He feels so whole. Tim curls his knees towards his chest and whispers thanks into the air to be taken back to her.</p><p>-</p><p>There is something incredibly peaceful about Connor Hawke. Tim envies him that sort of serenity, and at the same time is completely baffled at how he manages it.</p><p>Connor laughs, petting the belly of one of the <em>sagitarrius-panteras</em>, "Can I not say the same of you, Tim? You look so settled here. It is enviable, that you who is so far from what many would consider your home is so at peace. You should look out of place, here, but you do not. You look as if you belong here. As if you were always meant to be sitting in that spot, in those clothes."</p><p>Tim hums, looking down at his hands, "Do you think?"</p><p>"Yes." Connor replies, gently picking the small creature up and setting him down off to the side. He watches it as it toddles off to splash around in the water with his siblings. "Even I do not feel so at peace in my own home. Though, to be fair, I was not raised in the southern isles and only recently came to live there. So I suppose it makes some sense. How long have you been here?"</p><p>"Ten and two years." Tim says, "A long time. You were raised in the Land of the Eternal Edas, yes? I have never gone, though I have often sent various people there for one reason or the other. I have scryed Cassandra there, once or twice. But it is not the same as being there."</p><p>"No." Connor shakes his head. "Perhaps someday you can convince your King to take you with him on a tour. The <em>sakura</em> are very beautiful."</p><p>"Sakura?" Tim blinks, tilting his head.</p><p>"Cherry blossoms." Connor says, drawing a five petalled flower with his finger. "There are a special kind that grow only in the Land of Eternal Edas. They are very beautiful, and like the jacarandas their petals can blanket the earth. it is truly a sight to behold."</p><p>"Someday." Tim says, "Perhaps. But for now, I suppose I will have to settle with the words from others. I thank you for coming so far."</p><p>Connor smiles, accepting a cup of tea from him, "It is not a problem, brother. It does me good to see a familiar face. The road to and from Edas and the southern isles is long and lonely. Someday I think I would like to bring Mia or Lian with me when I travel. If they will it. Which reminds me – how go things here?"</p><p>"Well enough." Tim sighs, rolling one of his rings between his fingers. "The information you sent me was very helpful, Connor. I thank you. I am sorry for whatever troubles you had to go through to get it."</p><p>"Your problems are my problems." Connor replies, "And it does both our people good to get rid of a common enemy. I admit that I was a little surprised that you sent Jason. I did not think Jason ever left your side."</p><p>Tim snorts. "You mistake him for a doting brother, Connor. Besides, when he is away I can get away with the things he won't allow me."</p><p>Connor raises an eyebrow. Tim grins.</p><p>"You have <em>no</em> idea how much sex one can have if they do not have an overbearing sibling looking over their shoulder at all hours of the day."</p><p>-</p><p>It is rare that Tim is allowed to be out of the Imperial City. But Dick's route is going through a dangerous path, and they would rather lose a favorite to the ward of a consort, than the ward themselves, and so Tim goes as Dick's guard.</p><p>Tim has seen many things in his life, but it always scares, and awes him, that there is still much more to see. He is reminded of the fact that he is not as well traveled as Dick or Cassandra, or even Jason, at times like these when he forces himself to shut his mouth so as to not look like a gaping fool.</p><p>"Beautiful, is it not?" Dick says, hand on Tim's shoulder as they draw closer to the mountains and plains that mark the edges of the Immortal King's western territory. "Gotham is just over those mountains."</p><p>"It is so <em>green</em>." Tim whispers. Not in his entire life could Tim have pictured a mountain to be so <em>green</em>.</p><p>The mountains of the north are white and gray, brown with a few splashes of black and deep, deep green. But it is mostly blinding whites and blues.</p><p>Dick laughs, but it is good natured as he points at things and tells Tim their names. Names he has only heard in stories from Jason and Selina and Bruce.</p><p>"It is so beautiful." Tim says, "This land is – I do not know why you would ever want to leave it." The air is cool and dry, and it tastes so crisp.</p><p>Dick's smile is soft as he turns to look over the trail, hands on his hips.</p><p>"I don't know why, either." Dick admits, "But somehow I do. And I ask myself that question I go somewhere new."</p><p>-</p>

</p><p>It is, surprisingly enough, not any of Tim's official spies who finds the one who poisoned him, or even finds the root of the poison and the mind behind the scheme. It is Roy, who came with Dick to surprise Jason and Cassandra two nights after Tim falls into his fever.</p><p>"It is a good thing we came," Roy says as they wait outside of Tim's rooms with Cassandra. "We had heard – "</p><p>"We were three days out from the Imperial City's walls when we heard that the High Consort had been struck ill." Dick says, "How fares our brother, sister?"</p><p>"Not well." Cassandra answers, biting her lip as she stares at the doorway, "He is not here. He opens his eyes and he does not see, he speaks but in a language no one can understand. His skin burns like fire, and his skin has dried and cracked like the earth in the wastes. We have made no headway in finding – in finding who or what did this to him."</p><p>"Goddess be merciful." Dick whispers. "And everyone else? No one else was harmed? How did it happen?"</p><p>"It was during the mid-day meal." Cassandra says. "It was open court – anyone could have done it. Jason is either driving himself insane looking for hints, or making himself sick staying at Tim's side."</p><p>"And the King?" Roy asks, "What has he done?"</p><p>"He has been too busy trying to – you will see for yourself. Tim's control. It is not good." Cassandra says. They can hear the sounds of the Consort's Guards coming in and out, unusually loud as they hurry to capture and transfer all the animals in the Consort's Garden to the King's Garden. "It is not safe to be in the Consort's Gallery for the untrained, and the entire city is in an uproar trying to control the chaos of the High Consort's would-be-assassination."</p><p>"I would imagine." Dick whispers, the three of them stop, tensing as they are hit by a wave of sheer <em>power </em>that momentarily sends a sheet of frost over the floor and walls. They hear a half-strangled moan and the sound of movement. "What is that?"</p><p>"Tim." Cass says, shuddering, "His magic is out of control. Sometimes it is there, sometimes it is not. Like waves. The King has been trying to keep it contained, but if his concentration slips just a little the backlash is enough to break bone. Tim has already broken two of his own ribs, and gave Jason a concussion. The King is considering using the powers of Lazarus on him."</p><p>-</p><p>The ruby-scale rears back on her legs, and breathes flame onto the ground around him.</p><p>"<em>Insolent</em>." She snarls. "Arrogant. Boastful. <em>Proud</em>."</p><p>"Confident." Tim says over the beat of her wings, "Like the first of the frost-born to whom the first dragons gave their horns and <em>seithr</em> to. To whom <em>Ymir</em> gifted with the <em>hammask</em>. "</p><p>The she-dragon bellows – "Swear to me, <em>Ymir-blessed</em>, swear to me that your horns and life are mine if you fail."</p><p>"I swear, great-one." Tim answers, even as the ruby-scale opens her great maw and breathes the white-flame of dragon's <em>seithr</em> upon him. It burns for only a moment, before he feels it entering him. Pushing its way through the binding on his power and burning itself into his own <em>seithr</em>. Mixing and melting, melding, until the she-dragon is part of him.</p><p>"I will watch you, frost-born." The ruby-scale says. Tim can feel the low, heavy beats of her heart in his chest. "And I will reclaim that gift of mine if I see you start to slip."</p><p>Tim places his hand over his heart, "I will bring your <em>seithr</em> honor, mother-dragon."</p><p>She extends her long, serpentine neck and breathes a soft cloud of <em>seithr-</em>steam onto him. "There are not many who would present themselves to the ruby-born, Timothy the brave. Bring me honor, boy-of-my-breath, child-of-my-heart. Bring me honor to sing back to my brethren."</p><p>Tim opens his arms as she pushes the tip of her nose against his chest. He closes his eyes and feels her -</p><p>"I will, mother-dragon. I will."</p><p>-</p><p>It is not exactly a game. Tim prefers to think of it more as training.</p><p>For himself and for his successor as the Commander – and while he's at it, the guards of the Imperial city. It is most certainly not training for Jason or Cassandra, or any of the Consort's Guards, though Jason has complained about all the running and jumping on the occasion.</p><p>"You were once a Kingsman, suck it up." Tim says as Jason grumbles, a few paces behind him, "They are gaining on us."</p><p>"Well maybe if you did not stop to help every single doe-eyed creature you see on the way we could have lost them by now."</p><p>"Hush, you. Or should I point out that you have made us detour four times because you wanted to help little orphan children find shelter for the night?"</p><p>"Shut up."</p><p>It is not a game, for Tim does not do this to <em>force</em> the guards to take chase, nor does he do it for entertainment. Tim does it because for the past ten years of his life, his sole purpose in this country was to guard, protect, serve, and deal out justice. And for the past eight or so years, Tim had grown used to doing just that by sneaking out of the palace walls at night to take vendetta, and protect those he had found along the way in the slums and copper-districts.</p><p>And Tim refuses to sit idly by and grow soft and fat as High Consort just because no one expects him to do anything.</p><p>"Go back without me." Tim says, turning to veer off towards one of the many, many entrances to the underground markets. Tim knows that any number of city officials would <em>kill</em> to know what Tim knows of the illegal trades. But what happens in the shadows of the city have their purposes, and Tim has found more than one useful operative in the hands of raiders and slavers.</p><p>It is endlessly ironic that Tim has been both the Commander of the King's guard, a vigilante, and one of the strongest powers in the illegal trade of the Immortal King's Empire.</p><p>"Fine, but you cannot blame this on me, later." Jason says, turning and darting off in the other direction as Tim leaves the rooftops to navigate the alleyways. The alleys are his friends, no one here would give him away. High Consort or no.</p><p>He has been, and always will be, Tim. The boy who kills slavers and brings vendetta.</p><p>These nighttime excursions – while unapproved and for the most part, looked at with derision by many nobles – are good for him.</p><p>For all of them. It keeps Z on his toes, and makes sure the guards are alert. And it keeps Tim in touch with his people. With his city.</p><p>-</p><p>"Harper." Tim whispers, stopping so hard he almost falls over as he's running over rooftops. "Harper?"</p><p>He is frozen, for a moment, surprised and unbelieving of what, who, he is seeing, before turns around and starts running after her – but no. It is not <em>her. </em>It is <em>him</em>. Cullen. It <em>must</em> be Cullen, it cannot be anyone else but the ever elusive twin brother who Tim has been trying to track down for three years.</p><p>Tim follows, and Cullen must be new to the city because he is dressed like a peasant from one of the plantations. Tim can see no chains or manacles that would mark him as a slave. He must be a run-away, or free. But it is clear that he did not make his way to the Imperial City with ease. Cullen is thin, and he moves slowly. Injured? Sick? Weak? Unwell? Tim bites his lip with worry as he follows Cullen down into the black market entrances.</p><p>What is Cullen doing here?</p><p>Tim wants to go up to him, to see his face, to make <em>sure</em> – but you never know who is watching. Tim must be careful. He could be mistaken. Or Cullen could be being followed by someone else. Then both of them would fall.</p><p>Jason would not know where to look for him. And there is an unfortunate number of people who would pay for a thirteen year old boy to take as their slave – branded or no.</p><p>He slowly makes his way closer and closer to the other boy. Cullen seems to be going somewhere with purpose, and Tim cannot see anyone who is following him. But there are a few who see him and, predictably, try to take Cullen by force. Tim intercepts them before they can draw close, and leaves them unconscious against walls and cages and merchant stalls. The market of flesh is always greedy, and Tim cannot fault them for looking at Cullen as a prime target. He memorizes their faces so he can find them later, though.</p><p>He wonders if he will find them in time.</p><p>Tim always wonders if he gets there in time.</p><p>Eventually Tim follows Cullen into one of the several underground slums – made of grimy cloth and splintered boxes, scraps of furniture and hollow-eyed thin-lipped skeletons, and mal-formed dying souls.</p><p>The boy quietly crouches to crawl inside one of the tents. Tim should go in – he should go in and talk to him. Harper has been waiting for so long -</p><p>But if there is anything that Tim has learned, it is that caution is key.</p><p>Tim leaves.</p><p>-</p><p>Power rushes out of Tim's body, and it leaves him breathless – dumb, blind, deaf, and mute – for a moment. Then for the first time in what feels like years he is <em>coherent</em> again. He is <em>himself</em>.</p><p>Tim opens his eyes and can see-taste-smell-feel again. As himself. It is strange not to feel the binding on his power. While it is true that Tim has learned how to slip past it, to draw his true form back and use the power of his flesh and <em>seithr</em> with them on, he has always felt them <em>there</em>. Pushing against his will and calling him back, holding him back. Constant reminders that he is bound to the Immortal King's will.</p><p>His chest expands and he can taste-feel his <em>seithr</em> moving and pushing out of him. It is slow and sluggish, tainted – but the earth's energy rushes up to meet his, forcing Tim's magic out and cycling it and diluting it, replacing it with fresh energy. He is being cleansed.</p><p>(Balance. The earth must always be <em>balanced</em>. All energy is balanced.)</p><p>The entire area is frozen. And Tim looks down to see Ra's' arm around his chest – a dim and thin coating of green flame over the skin. Tim turns around, startled –</p><p>Ra's' mouth is clenched shut, jaw tight – <em>seithr</em> drawn close over his skin, the Lazarus' flames buffeting him against the frost that seems to be pouring off of Tim's body. Tim reaches up to touch Ra's' face, hand stopping a mere breath away from the flame, and cannot feel the heat, he is so blessedly cold. He stops his hand before he can touch Ra's' skin, and just touches the air above it.</p><p>"You have been – " Ra's starts, eyes closing as he falls silent.</p><p>"I have been?" Tim prompts. He is weary – but the cycle of energy feels so refreshing. So stunning. He feels so <em>free</em>. So much better now – he almost cannot believe that he had been in so much distress earlier. "What happened?"</p><p>"You have been unconscious, waning, for the past three days." Ra's says. "You would not – you did not wake. Not truly. I was afraid for your life." Ra's lets out a long breath. "You are determined to drive me to my grave with worry."</p><p>"It cannot have been that serious if you are up to making jokes about it." Tim replies, "Did I hurt you?"</p><p>"Your magic is strong, but the powers of the Lazarus flame are more than capable of keeping yours at bay." Ra's replies. "The poison – it had unintended side affects. It was intended to target your biology. There were – the assassin had made assumptions he should not have."</p><p>"Found?" Tim asks. The change and flow of magic is lulling, combined with the feeling of Ra's' <em>seithr</em> burning against his own, Tim feels so relaxed. "What for?"</p><p>"No. Your spies are at work. But at the moment we are working on making you better, most beloved one." Ra's replies. "The poison is not deadly to us of the south. But it is towards your people. The assassin had assumed that your southern form was an illusion, that underneath it you were still wearing your true skin."</p><p>"No." Tim replies, "I am lost in my southern skin."</p><p>"Yes – you change all the way. But your magic stays the same. The poison made your flesh fevered. But your magic reacted as if you were under attack. It was trying to escape you, it was building in on itself, propagating in order to push out the taint without anywhere to go, causing more of your energy to grow tainted as the poison built up. Your body could not naturally expel it because of how your magic was putting stress upon you. A vicious cycle."</p><p>"How did you figure it out?" Tim asks.</p><p>"Roy Harper came with the First Consort's ward to visit. It was – it was a lucky chance that he came."</p><p>Roy – Roy is an expert in poisons and medicines.</p><p>"Any longer and I would have lost you, beloved one." Ra's says, "How cruel of you – to almost die so soon into our marriage. You would leave me a widow so soon?"</p><p>"You talk as if I got poisoned on <em>purpose</em>." Tim complains. "And perhaps now you will get the council to reconsider keeping the seals on me."</p><p>"Perhaps." Ra's sighs, reaching up to touch the base of one of Tim's horns, "You bury me, most loved one. You will bury me."</p><p>"Never." Tim says, pushing away – "Never."</p><p>Ra's lets him go, and Tim drifts into the ice – water and <em>seithr</em> changing with every breath between ice and frost and liquid – and into the depths of the garden. Ra's' eyes do not leave him the entire time, and Tim does not look away, even when he is too far away to see Ra's' face.</p><p>Tim spreads his arms to his sides, and reaches deep into his core. He can feel Mac-<em>amme's</em> gift, still circling around his shoulders, the <em>seithr</em> there is pure and untainted. Clean. The ruby-scale's <em>seithr</em> is harder to find, it burns bright – but it is diluted and flickering among his tainted magic. Tim calls to it, calling the mother-dragon's power forward.</p><p>He can still feel her heartbeat behind his, a shadow – he can feel her concern, her rage, her sorrow, her longing. Tim calls upon it and hears the earth answer.</p><p>The <em>seithr</em> in the air changes. It charges, and Tim can feel the dragon's breath between his fingers, beginning to burn and light him up from the inside out.</p><p>Tim opens his eyes and calls down lightning.</p><p>(It rains in the Imperial City for three days and three nights. And the people rejoice.)</p><p>-</p><p>"I would ask a favor of you." Tim says, on the night before their wedding. It is incredibly improper for them to be seeing each other before the official ceremony, but propriety has never been high either of their list of priorities. And if anyone expected Tim to be <em>proper</em> for a single moment before gaining the title of High Consort they are solely mistaken. Tim will relish his precious moments of freedom while they last.</p><p>(This does not mean that he will behave when he <em>is</em> Consort, however. Just that he will make an effort only to misbehave when it will scandalize the most amount of people to the greatest degree. He would not want them to grow <em>accustomed</em> to his behaviors, after all.</p><p>Always keep the enemy guessing.)</p><p>Ra's tilts his head, waving his hand for Tim to enter. Tim neatly tucks himself in through the window, landing on his bare feet and padding over to sit at Ra's' side. Ra's rests his hand on Tim's head, fingers tangling with Tim's hair as he continues to write with the other.</p><p>"What boon may I give to my most beloved blade?" Ra's asks. Tim rests his head on Ra's' knee – he has at least an hour before anyone thinks to check Ra's' rooms for his whereabouts. They always look last in the places which they should look first, it is amazing how no one ever <em>learns</em>.</p><p>Tim hums, leaning into Ra's' touch – "At the ceremony, will you kneel?"</p><p>It is customary for the consorts entering the royal family to kneel to be anointed and blessed by the King instead of the spirit of the house's flame. Bruce knelt. Selina knelt. Shiva knelt. And all were blessed by Ra's instead of Lazarus. For he is the patriarch, and their superior.</p><p>But he will not be <em>Tim's</em> patriarch, and Tim is not the lesser one in this relationship.</p><p>"Kneel?" Ra's repeats, setting down his quill and looking down at him. But he does not remove his hand from Tim's hair, nor does he sound upset by the question. "You would have me kneel?"</p><p>Tim looks up at him – "Only at the private flame. I do not care at the public one. Are you offended?"</p><p>Ra's is quiet for a moment before laughing – "You never cease to amuse me, beloved one. You could ask for wealth, for the death of those who have wronged you – you could ask for land and slaves. Jewels and silks and precious metals, tools for magic and craft. Lovers, whores, soldiers, war, peace, power. And you ask me to <em>kneel</em>?"</p><p>Tim huffs and starts to turn away – "Well if you are going to laugh at me I take it back and ask for all of the above – "</p><p>Ra's captures Tim's face between his hands and kisses his forehead.</p><p>"It is nothing for me to kneel. For tomorrow I am not a King, but a man. I am most honored to kneel before the Lazarus with you."</p><p>-</p><p>"Cloth?" Selina blinks, "Thread? Beads and – bone needles?"</p><p>"Yes." Tim says, crossing his legs underneath himself, "Do you know where I can get some?"</p><p>"I never knew you to be interested in such things." Selina replies slowly, "It is – strange. Sewing is considered a woman's art."</p><p>"In the south it is." Tim replies.</p><p>"Are you bored? Is it because of a lack of things to do?" She asks, frowning as she gets some paper and ink, "I am just curious."</p><p>"There is something I must make." Tim replies, "And I need supplies. It is something of a tradition in the north, one I have largely neglected in the the past few years. And frankly, now that I have the time, I feel wrong for continuing to neglect them."</p><p>There are many things he has neglected to do, and he might as well start fixing that now.</p><p>"Well then, let us get you started." Selina says, "What do we need?"</p><p>Tim starts to count on his fingers, "I need needles made of bone. Preferably the bone or horn of a ram, or cow. The horn of a horse or other hoofed animal would work too. Thread – of any grade and any type, as long as it can hold. I need heavy cloth. Furs and leather. Glass and bone beads. Patterns – there should be no animals in the patterns. Shapes, yes. The more intricate the better, but no animals. Flowers and trees perhaps, if there is nothing else, but no animals. The furs and leathers – no prey animals. No rabbit, no fox. The pelts should be plain, but healthy. No panteras, no tigers, or anything of that sort."</p><p>Selina nods as she writes, Tim closes his eyes and flicks through the many, many things he must make. But first and foremost is the gift of kinship to the <em>hulgr</em>.</p><p>"The colors – I want the colors to be pale. White, blue, gray. Gold and silver would be acceptable. But white – lots of white." Tim imagines the great quilt that he must craft and weave for Mac-<em>amme</em> and her clan, long overdue. "I – would there happen to be a loom somewhere in the palace?"</p><p>Selina raises a slender eyebrow.</p><p>"For the High Consort of the realm, it can be arranged." She drawls. "Even if we had to scour every inch of the empire. Anything else?"</p><p>"Sewing lessons." Tim deadpans, "Embroidery lessons. And while we're at it, spinning lessons to make more thread."</p><p>Selina raises the other eyebrow.</p><p>"You are a complex tangle of mysteries, High Consort. You must leave the King baffled on a constant basis."</p><p>"I try."</p>

</p><p>Tim sucks on his finger where the heat and friction of built up <em>seithr </em>and magic had burned him, the distaff is uncomfortable in his other hand and at the rate he is going it will take him<em> years</em> to complete this working. He sighs as he sets the distaff and thread down, looking out the window at the clouded sky. It does not snow here, but it rains. And it is not the cold rain Tim always expects, anticipates. It is hot, muggy, and makes him feel just as sluggish as the afternoon sun in mid-summer.</p><p>The rains come and go, appearing at the drop of a hat and leaving no trace of themselves behind within moments.</p><p>But the <em>thunder</em>. The <em>thunder</em> is so very loud and strong – it rumbles and lightning flashes in the sky, lighting the clouds up from within. It is so very beautiful and completely unlike any kind of storm in the north. Tim does not think he will ever get used to how beautiful these summer storms are, for all that he terrifies his attendants when he climbs onto the wet roofs and laughs and raises his arms to the sky.</p><p>It is not as if he would be <em>struck</em> by the lightning, not when lightning runs within his veins and skitters over his skin and bends to his will. Even if he were, he does not think it would hurt very much. Certainly less than when the ruby-scale gave him her <em>seithr</em>.</p><p>Tim watches the rain, tasting the <em>seithr</em> on the tip of his tongue as he reaches his arm out through the lattice to catch the first few drops.</p><p>He hears the soft warning scuff of Jason's boot, withdraws his arm and turns to his brother – "How goes it?"</p><p>"Well enough. The new recruits to the guard will need some – <em>readjustment</em>." Jason shrugs, "Cassandra is on it. It is a good warm up for her, and breaking in the recruits has never been my strong suit."</p><p>"No, only reshaping them once you have broken their will." Tim teases, "Good. Our sister always teaches the recruits excellent basics. When do you think they will be ready?"</p><p>"A season, maybe two. The most important part is breaking their biases. They should start their rotations with the regular guard within a few weeks. You want me to write down their names for you?"</p><p>"I picked them." Tim points out, "I can remember."</p><p>"And how do things go here?" Jason asks, raising an eyebrow at the distaff, "Poorly, I assume."</p><p>"Normally I would take offense, but you assume correctly. I do not suppose you would know how to spin thread?"</p><p>"No, sad to say, but my instruction did not include learning how to make textiles by hand." Jason replies, grinning as sprawls over the pillows and settles in for an afternoon nap. Tim is pretty sure half of his guard is absolutely scandalized by their commander's supposed laxness. To be fair to Jason, if anything gets past all of the guards around them, and close enough to seriously injure Tim while Jason's guard is down, chances are that Jason would not have been able to stop the attack in the first place. "What is it for, anyway? You have yet to tell anyone, not even Selina. You tell Selina everything."</p><p>Only because Selina has a way of making his head spin in circles until she rips the information out of him while he's still reeling from whiplash.</p><p>"It is." Tim shifts, fighting back the flush, "It is <em>personal</em>."</p><p>Jason raises an eyebrow. "You came to me for advice on sex. Repeatedly. Then you straight up went to <em>Selina</em> for advice on sex when I could not give you enough information. And then you went to <em>Shiva</em>. Tim, you are not <em>personal</em> or <em>private</em>."</p><p>"I am about <em>some</em> things." Tim flushes. Jason hums -</p><p>"Talia knows how to spin." Jason rolls over onto his side, yawning, "And she does not pry. You can ask her, she comes back to the city in a week."</p><p>"I suppose." Tim sighs, waving his hand to get rid of the tingling feeling of raw magic. "In the mean time, what am I to do now?"</p><p>"Not use the loom because it is loud as all hells and I am <em>tired</em>." Jason grumbles. "Go do whatever personal thing it is you are trying to do."</p><p>-</p><p>"This is an unexpected visit." Tim says, holding his hand out to grasp Slade's as the man settles down next to him.</p><p>"I apologize for not giving prior warning." Slade replies, "You are well?"</p><p>"I am – are you? Is there something wrong? How is Rose?"</p><p>"All is well. I did not come to cause alarm." Slade waves his hand, "I come to ask something of you, blood-brother, son of my blood-sister." Tim blinks at the sudden formality. Tim straightens up as Slade sheds the illusion of his southern skin, his skin paling and the things around him getting covered in a light sheen of frost as his true form settles.</p><p>Tim shifts as well, allowing his true nature to push past the weakening bonds that really are only kept on for formalities sake.</p><p>"Speak, blood-of-my-flesh, blood-of-my-blood."</p><p>"I come to ask for your blessing to build a stead on my blood-sister's lands." Slade says, a flash of remorse, a flash of pain, lingering in his single eye. "The period of cleansing is almost over."</p><p>Tim's stomach churns at the thought – the memory. Tim will be eighteen soon. And the tradition is that no land that has been struck by disaster may be reclaimed, rebuilt, or renamed until the youngest of the stead's line of inheritance reaches the age of majority.</p><p>"Many believe me dead. You need not ask for what is not mine to give." Tim replies, making a cutting motion with his hands.</p><p>"I know you are alive. Rose knows you are alive. Many who hear the rumors of the Immortal King's pale-skinned commander from the North believe." Slade shakes his head. "No. I will not assume. The land is yours, the sister-<em>hulgr</em> mourn you, the earth weeps for your loss. I ask."</p><p>"Blood-brother of my mother, blood-brother of mine, you do not need to ask." Tim says, reaching out to tug at one of Slade's horns, knocking their foreheads together and holding him there. "I cannot leave this land, and you are the only one of my blood-kin alive. The land is yours, you know I would not contest it, blood-brother, blood-father, blood-of-my-blood. Go with my blessings. Build a great and powerful stead worthy of your name. Bring honor to the land, respect to the <em>hulgrfolke</em> and the welcome of the <em>domovyk</em>."</p><p>Tim releases Slade's horns and goes to call for wine.</p><p>"Let us celebrate blood-of-my-blood," Tim says as he stands, "For my mother and father's name will rise from the frost and snow, and our blood-kin will be feared once more."</p><p>-</p><p>"You used to complain so much when people touched you." Ra's says as Tim runs his palm over the smooth skin of his back.</p><p>"That is different." Tim says, and he knows Ra's' body like the back of his own hand. He has been around the royal family for years, caught in a strange situation of distance and familiarity by his connection to Jason and Selina's fondness of him. He has trained with the King in hand to hand combat, and he has learned pressure points on this back, he has memorized the scars that should be here with all of his being.</p><p>Tim knows every callous, every scar, every muscle of Ra's' body.</p><p>"It is all gone." Tim whispers, and even now – so far away from the Imperial City and t he court and the world that Tim has accepted as his own, he cannot wrap his mind around this.</p><p>There is no scar on Tim's belly from the blow that should have killed him. And there are no scars on Ra's' skin.</p><p>Tim takes one of Ra's' long-fingered hands between his own, and the small scars on his fingers from the nick of blades and magic tools are gone. The fine lines that should cross over Ra's' forearms from long practice with bladework are absent, leaving his skin smooth and strangely empty.</p><p>Even the thicker, heavier scars of older injuries, who's histories Tim had never truly learned are gone. Absent.</p><p>"Lazarus burns time away." Ra's says, patient as Tim runs his fingertips over his skin. Ra's has always been patient with him. "It erases and renews. It gives and it takes. Such is the nature of fire."</p><p>It makes Tim think of water, and how it comes and goes, changes and remains the same. It is adaptable, filling crevices and covering surfaces, spreading and receding, changing and somehow always <em>present</em>.</p><p>Change.</p><p>In time, Tim thinks as he releases Ra's' hands, he will grow to accept this Ra's, too. This younger, fresher, Ra's who is whole and hale. In time.</p><p>But for now, Tim reaches for Ra's' shoulder and turns him to examine the blank canvas of his back.</p><p>-</p><p>After the earth is finished pushing and cleansing his magic and his <em>seithr</em> resettles, Tim is exhausted. The fever is still there, but the poison is gone, and Tim's body is weakened and drained. Tim almost falls, but Ra's is there in an instant to pull him back to shore.</p><p>The days and weeks afterwards find Tim tired and unable to concentrate. For once, Tim feels as if the fight has been taken from him. He has no interest in finding out who did this to him, or what fate they meet. He has no inclination to search, to turn the city upside down and raze everything until he has the one behind this scheme by the balls and his fingers in their eye socket.</p><p>His blood-kin are concerned. Slade and Rose even drop by -</p><p>"This is unlike you." Rose says, watching Tim's hands shake as he tries to thread a needle. "You should be out there – you should be doing something. Be <em>angry</em> for fuck's sake. Be afraid. Be nervous. Be apprehensive. Be <em>something</em>. The people of the city are more upset than you are. <em>I</em> am more upset than you are."</p><p>"They did not succeed." Tim shrugs. "And I am tired."</p><p>Rose takes the needle and thread from his unsteady hands, "<em>Tim</em>."</p><p>"No, Rose." Tim says, "No."</p><p>-</p><p>Tim's hands are not used to such fine work – even the ladders and chords and knots he rarely makes for <em>seithr</em> are not as involved as this. It is frustrating but Tim refuses to give up. He pours <em>seithr</em> into it, and hum-sing-chants his will into the fabric and thread. He sings of winter frosts and summer storms, he sings about the brilliant purple and pink flowers in the courtyards and the jewel-colored tiles in the bathing rooms.</p><p>He calls forth the image of the clumsy hatchlings, with their small dotted hind legs and the fluffy down of their little breasts. Tim tells the fabric about the hot, wet heat of summer and the flash storms that rumble and crackle one moment and disappear the next. He presses the scent of opium and perfume into the thread, and ties the sound of soldiers at their drills into every knot.</p><p>It is hard, demanding work to do this. For it is the work of two – and Tim. Tim does not feel quite confident enough to bring the topic up with Ra's'.</p><p>He is <em>the King</em> and he has more – more important things to do than this. It is a silly tradition, and nothing more. The man is busy enough as it is and Tim will not bother him with such trivial matters.</p><p>Tim sews the sensation of Lazarus'<em> seithr </em>with gold thread onto deep black and red fabric Tim hum-chants his surprise and shock under his breath as he sews in the dawning light. Dawn and dusk are the best times to do a working. The <em>seithr</em> changes and everything is in flux, in transition. The air itself is charged and it is easier to manipulate the magic to do as he wills it. The magic is eager, the <em>seithr</em> malleable and easy to capture.</p><p>Tradition says that he does this by the light of the moon, or by dragon's flame. But Tim has not learned this art or mastered it, and he is working alone. He thinks Mac-<em>amme</em> will forgive him for not doing this the proper way.</p><p>And Tim needs all the help he could get.</p><p>"So this is what you have been hiding from me." Ra's' voice startles him, and Tim pricks his finger on the needle. Ra's takes Tim's finger into his mouth, humming as he presses against Tim's back, arms curling around Tim's waist. "What is this?"</p><p>"Nothing." Tim says, moving to fold the fabric and put it away with the rest, but Ra's is quick and has the advantage of size – he tugs the fabric from Tim's hands – "Give it!"</p><p>"No." Ra's replies, and Tim's ears and neck burn with embarrassment as Ra's looks over his poor handiwork. "This is what you have been working on. You surprised Talia when you asked her to teach you. She has been curious ever since."</p><p>"And unlike the rest of you, she has the manners to keep it to herself." Tim snaps, turning away.</p><p>"Will you not tell me what it is? Am I not supposed to know? You work on this constantly, but you tell no one what it is."</p><p>"It is – it is silly." Tim curls in on himself, "It is an old tradition and busy work and nothing more."</p><p>"You say that, and yet you flush. I do not think that I have ever seen you flush so, not even when we lie together. It is – strangely attractive." He can feel Ra's' silent laughter – and Tim snarls -</p><p>"It is a <em>tradition couples do in the north</em>." Tim says, twisting around to grab at the fabric, "Bound couples sew a banner that tells the story of how they chose one another and present it to the guardian of the land and ask for that guardian to look over them. It is part of the textiles and cloths that are usually presented before the binding ceremony."</p><p>There are a great many things involved in the process of courtship in the north. And while Tim has never exactly looked forward to any of them, he had always assumed he would eventually do them.</p><p>"The couple works on the various clothes for their new household together." Tim mutters, "They make bedding for their first year, wall hangings, cloaks, rugs, and offerings for the guardians of the land and any givers of <em>seithr</em>. And they do it by hand because – because it is supposed to mean something. It is supposed to take a long time. Because they are physically building a home, a bond. One part is supposed to be done in the beginning, and as the couple grows closer they add more until they are ready to complete the bond."</p><p>Tim had been planning on sending the banner to Mac-<em>amme</em> through Slade or Rose when he had completed it. It would take a long time, doing it all by himself – learning the craft, deciding which images to show, gathering the materials, and gathering the magic and charging the <em>seithr</em> and pressing it into the finished piece. But it has been driving him crazy – now that things have settled and he has time to <em>think</em>. It drives him crazy that he did not do this, any of this, <em>before</em> receiving the title of Consort.</p><p>And while it is true that Tim has not – Tim has not broached the topic of being blood bound, or even really considered it -</p><p>It still feels <em>wrong</em>.</p><p>"And you were doing it all yourself?" Ra's says, "And keeping it hidden from me?"</p><p>"Yes." Tim answers, waits for Ra's' response. A jest, perhaps. Or maybe dismissal. Tim bites the inside of his cheek. It is foolish, and there is – it is just symbolism and tradition and Tim has never really been fond of either before, there is no reason for him to be so affected now -</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Why did you hide this from me?" Ra's asks, chin resting on Tim's shoulder as he reaches for the basket where Tim has been hiding the pieces he has already started for the banner, "We are supposed to do this together, are we not? For is it not a relationship between the two of <em>us</em>? Am I a blameless party here?"</p><p>Tim sputters, staring as Ra's pulls one of Tim's needles out and threads it -</p><p>"You are the <em>King</em>. You do – you do not have <em>time</em> for these things – "</p><p>"I am your husband, most beloved one." Ra's says, "I have time for <em>you</em>."</p><p>Tim closes his mouth with a click, leaning against Ra's' chest.</p><p>"And being the King has never stopped you from making me do things <em>before</em>." Ra's adds on, "Now, tell me what to do so as to least offend these guardians of yours."</p><p>Tim does not know if Ra's is capable of making a working as he is, and he does not know if Ra's is able to manipulate the <em>seithr</em> in the way it is meant to be when the man cannot see-taste-smell-feel it as Tim can.</p><p>But something in Tim's chest eases up as he watches the man create perfect stitch after stitch in the calm early morning.</p><p>("Do not presume that I do not know things, barbarian."</p><p>"Fine, I apologize for not realizing that needlework was on your long, long list of talents and skills."</p><p>"Apology accepted.")</p><p>Tim leans back and breathes in the smell of <em>seithr</em>, magic, and Ra's.</p><p>It feels as if a great burden has been lifted from his shoulders, and that every tangle and every snarl will work itself out.</p><p>(Tim thinks that Mac-<em>amme</em> and the ruby-scale will be proud to receive the first workings of their house.)</p>

</p><p>Tim's first official act as the King's Blade and Commander of the Imperial armies to to purge their ranks. There are too many noble and merchant sons and daughters who have been put here for rank, fame, or for other unsavory reasons. Tim's mouth twists as he holds back the words he wants to use to describe the dozens upon dozens of men and women who are among them as spies, deviants, or because their houses are too shamed to put them anywhere else.</p><p>"The army is not a <em>dumping ground</em>." Tim says when Ra's raises a single eyebrow at him. "Sign the order."</p><p>If Tim could, he would have done it without Ra's knowing, but something on this scale would require the King's approval or the nobles would get ansty.</p><p>Tim is only four hours into his new post and he would rather extinguish the plots already in motion against him than incur new ones so soon.</p><p>"This is not the north." Ra's reminds him, as if Tim needed it. And Tim snorts, pushes the order towards Ra's. "You cannot demand perfection."</p><p>"Says who?" Tim raises an eyebrow, "You demand it of me."</p><p>"You are my hand, my blade. My shield. You are part of my being, of course I can demand perfection of you." Ra's replies, dripping wax onto the parchment, "Are you not my most loyal soldier?"</p><p>"I would not go so far as to say <em>most</em> loyal." Tim replies, folding his arms behind his back, "And you should be lucky that I do not have command over your useless court as well."</p><p>"They believe that they are not, at it is always good to let them believe that they have some measure of control over their short lives." Ra's replies, humming. "Like dragonflies."</p><p>"Dragonflies are actually useful. They make ink." Tim replies, "Fireworks. Loud, annoying, and dangerous."</p><p>"Beautiful, though."</p><p>"Frivolous." Tim says, smile pulling over his face as Ra's applies his seal. Ra's gives him a narrowed eyed look and sighs -</p><p>"Do not raze my city to the ground. I would rather not have to move the capital of my empire just because you wanted to go on a hunt."</p><p>"Do not be ridiculous. You southerners always solve things with <em>fire</em>." Tim says, taking the order back, examining the drying ink and seal before rolling it up, "There are easier ways to silence the opposition. Cleaner ways."</p><p>"I do not want to know." Ra's says, waving Tim out of his office, "Just be thorough about it. Do not drag it out. And do not <em>drag anyone out of the city either</em>."</p><p>Tim waves a hand over his shoulder and shoots a grin at the guards exchanging panicked looks outside Ra's' door.</p><p>-</p><p>He does not like Shiva. He respects her, fears her, and accepts her as part of the royal family. But he does not <em>like her</em>.</p><p>She trained him, and she was a fair teacher – her style of teaching more like the way he learned to fight in the north than any of the others. But she is needlessly cruel, unaffected by the suffering of those around her in ways that make Tim's skin crawl and his chest burn uncomfortably.</p><p>Cassandra does not truly see the woman as her mother, and sees her more as a mentor and trainer than anything.</p><p>"It is the way she is." Cassandra says, digging her toes into the dirt as they rest from one of their spars. "Something happened to her when she was young. She was not always like this, I am told. She used to smile. And laugh. And cry. She used to lose – she was not always traveling."</p><p>"By <em>who</em>? What was she like?" Tim cannot imagine a Shiva who was not always restless, always aiming for the next challenge and searching out new and dangerous opponents. He cannot imagine her ever losing.</p><p>Her face is always blank in is mind, or otherwise twisted in a sneer or a fierce smile of blood and teeth mid-battle. It is an expression he only ever sees her see when she fights Talia or Bruce. The two of them are the only people who <em>will</em> fight with Shiva without being antagonized or ordered to. Cassandra says that Shiva had fought the King once.</p><p><em>Once</em>.</p><p>Tim assumes that he is one of the people she has lost to.</p><p>Talia, Tim thinks, has never won against Shiva. Tied against her, perhaps, but never won.</p><p>"The King." Cassandra says, turning her face to the blinding blue of the sky, shading her eyes. "He said that he knew her before. She was a performer, like how Dick's family was. But for play-fights. But something happened, and she did not do it anymore. And she became the way she is now."</p><p>They both close their eyes, turning away as a hot gust of wind blows in their direction, turning into each other.</p><p>Shiva is cold and callous, pain is nothing to her. There is no honor in the way she treats her opponents, as if they were not people, not living creatures, but tools for her own personal growth. She leaves her enemies broken and shamed, and stops seeing them. It is as if those she has defeated do not exist in her world.</p><p>Even Cassandra is treated like a shadow. Sometimes a sparring partner, sometimes a tool to train on, sometimes an amusing plaything. Rarely as a dam would her child.</p><p>Tim wonders why Shiva even <em>had</em> a daughter in the first place.</p><p>"Shiva used to have a sister." Cassandra says when the wind stops blowing, her hand tangles with Tim's. "Used to."</p><p>Tim squeezes her hand back.</p><p>"They fought together. Trained together." Cass continues. "They were everything together. And then she became like this. And then she had me. I do not think she sees <em>me</em>."</p><p>Tim leans against her – leaning his head against hers as she bows her face towards her knees.</p><p>"I have you." Cassandra says after a long pause. "I have you, and Jason."</p><p>"You are not her." Tim replies, "Because you are <em>my</em> sister. I see you." Tim wraps his arms around her shoulders and tucks his face into her neck. "I see you."</p><p>-</p><p>The magic and <em>seithr</em> behind workings – ladders and knots – is much different from that of the things he must make for the <em>hulgrfolke</em> and for his house. Tim remembers Rose teaching him the basic knots when they were small.</p><p>Knots and ladders were easy.</p><p>All you needed was rope, and bits of whatever you wanted – feather, bone, beads, wood, metal, stone, as long as you could tie the rope around it you could use it.</p><p>Manipulating the <em>seithr</em> was easy, too, and then charging it with magic was simple.</p><p>It was just knots.</p><p>But this – this crafting is hard. The <em>seithr</em> must be molded in just the right way for the magic to work, and the energy must be just so. The image in Tim's head must be perfectly matched to the <em>seithr</em> he presses into the fabric and string, and that <em>seithr</em> must not interfere with that which he has already sewn down.</p><p>It is hard, but it is – it is satisfying. With every stitch, with every thought Tim places down, it feels like it becomes more real. There is something relieving about it. It is as if all the thoughts Tim could not have, did not have time to think, or the awareness to form, are being shaped now. It is a series of realizations that strike Tim, coloring his memories, and making Tim re-examine his life.</p><p>There are no strict rules for the cloths that must be made, and Tim is fairly sure that there has never been any bonded couple like himself and Ra's before.</p><p>It is fascinating, to see his work unfurling before his eyes. It is neither Northern nor Southern in nature. It is both – it is a strange mix of the two that makes Tim think that perhaps they belong that way. He wonders if their people were ever one before.</p><p>It feels as if the curves and spirals and circles of Ra's' thread fit perfectly against the sharp corners of his own. Each circle seems to be perfect, all encompassing and blending one into the other.</p><p>Ra's' <em>seithr</em> is warm underneath Tim's fingertips as he runs his hands over the banner, and where it mixes with his own the <em>seithr</em> changes into something not hot. Not cold. Some strange sensation of raw <em>power</em> and <em>feeling</em> in between.</p><p>"Mac-<em>amme</em> will love it." Rose says when she sees it, careful not to touch it as she examines the small flowers Ra's had embroidered around Tim's interwoven knots. "I have never seen any like this. It is – it is beautiful."</p><p>There is no word for <em>beautiful</em> in their language. There are words for <em>use</em> and <em>harsh </em>and <em>dangerous</em>. There are words for <em>silent</em> and words for <em>peace</em>. But there is no word for beautiful. There is the strong, there is the blessed, there is the intelligent. But there is no word for <em>beauty</em>.</p><p>"Thank you." Tim says, smiling as he carefully folds the banner and wraps it in cotton. "Please deliver it with care."</p><p>"Mac-<em>amme</em> will be pleased." Rose says, touching the side of his neck with her fingers, "You have done so well for yourself, blood-of-my-blood."</p><p>-</p><p>As far as Tim understands it, the spirits of the south are not tied to the land, but to the flesh. And they are few and far in between, most of them are neutral or dangerous in nature. Few are guardians.</p><p>There are household flames, spirits of fire that protect and serve their houses. But those, too, are very few. Most of them are only of noble houses, and those without title or land, those without wealth or name, pray to gods instead of spirits.</p><p>It is much like the practice of <em>domovyk, </em>but for an entire flesh-line instead of one child. It is not a practice Tim knows very well, for paper is rare in the north. But Tim remembers sending paper dolls to the get of his mother and father's blood-kin when they were born.</p><p>They cut paper in the shape of people, two boys and two girls. And then they are decorated in ink with the runes for protection, health, and whatever else the dam and sire may have requested. Then the dolls are sent to the family's stead to be burned along with the other dolls from other steads. One is made by the parents, that is neither male nor female, and that one is made of special, thick paper made of blessed bark and done with expensive ink made from blood and berries collected by <em>Ymir's</em> well.</p><p>This doll is kept by the child at all times, given life and will and spirit – a new spirit born for the child. Intrinsically tied to the child's wellbeing. They live for the child. They die with the child.</p><p>It is similar, here. Not entirely the same, but similar enough that Tim can wrap his mind around it.</p><p>The household flame of the house al Ghul is the Lazarus. Tim has only heard about this flame in rumors and hushed whispers among his fellow trainees. No one has ever seen the flame, it is not kept within the ceremonial halls or in any of the rooms dedicated to artifacts and heirlooms of the line.</p><p>Tim wonders what these household flames look like. If they speak and have a will, if they are sexed or not. Tim wonders and does not ask.</p><p>When Damian is born he is taken before the household flame.</p><p>That night Jason and Cassandra slip into Tim's narrow cot, eyes bright and hands shaking as they whisper him awake.</p><p>"It is – it is terrifying. And powerful." Jason whispers, squeezing one of Tim's hands. "I have never felt anything like it."</p><p>"It was so <em>powerful</em>, Tim. I could not even think. I could not <em>speak</em>. I could not move, or look away even if I wanted to." Cassandra says, face against Tim's shoulder, hands clinging to the back of his tunic. "My heart was racing – it still is – I. My hands shake."</p><p>"As do mine." Jason replies, smile spreading across his face, "I do not know how to describe this feeling. It feels like – "</p><p>"Standing on the edge of the earth."</p><p>Tim is mostly asleep, tired from the day's training and still not yet fully versed in the ways of the south. So he yawns, nods, and dozes.</p><p>(Years later, when Tim sees the Lazarus for the first time, he will remember this half-dreaming conversation.)</p><p>-</p><p>Tim is half-dozing, propped up on several pillows on rugs and blankets that have been set out by the windows on the balcony of the Consort's Garden. His fever had finally broken, and <em>stayed</em> broken, last night and it was perhaps the first time he could truly sleep the night through. It was also the first night that Tim could convince Ra's to sleep at his side without fretting over him like a mother hen.</p><p>But eating is still a trial and chances of any food staying down are half at best. Thus far Tim has only been able to stomach a little broth and some bread.</p><p>"High Consort," Tim turns his head, brought back from his doze when he hears Bruce's voice from the doorway. "Am I disturbing you?"</p><p>"No." Tim says, smiling a little as Bruce comes in, sitting down next to him. "What brings you here, Bruce?"</p><p>"Concern." Bruce replies, checking Tim's temperature with the back of his hand.</p><p>"The fever broke – "</p><p>"I know." Bruce says, turning to cut one of the apples left on the breakfast tray, "I am still concerned. You are not yourself."</p><p>Tim raises an eyebrow. Bruce shakes his head as he begins to peel the fruit.</p><p>"Do you know why the Immortal King offered you a pardon?" Bruce says, and Tim senses that this is going to be a lecture. Perhaps a long one, even. Tim bites the inside of his cheek.</p><p>"Jason said it was because you asked him to."</p><p>Sometimes, when Tim thinks back to the haze of pain and rage and sorrow, Tim thinks he can remember someone Bruce's size and build in the masses of faces. But he can never be sure if the memory is real or if it is something his mind is creating to fit Jason's story.</p><p>"Yes. I came forward as a supplicant and asked for your life as a boon." Bruce says, the deep red of the apple peel falling in a perfect spiral onto his lap, "Do you know why?"</p><p>"Pity? Sympathy? Curiosity? A whim?"</p><p>Bruce raises a single unimpressed eyebrow, slicing into the apple's flesh and holding a slice out to Tim.</p><p>"No. It was because you did not deserve to die." Bruce replies. "Slaves are normal in this city. In other countries they may be called other things. Things like serfs, and indentured servants. But they are everywhere and normal. I do not agree with the practice. But I have seen many in my travels. I have seen slaves who resent their fate, who struggle tooth and nail to escape. I have seen others resigned to it, slaves who were born into servitude. As their parents were before them. So on and so forth. I have seen boys younger than you were being bought and sold by the dozen, crammed into cages like fruit at a vendor's stall. Covered in their own filth and blood and dirt."</p><p>Tim's gut twists at the image.</p><p>"But you were the first child I had ever seen branded both slave and murderer. You were so young – and already to be sent to the gallows. So far from home, estranged from everything you knew." Bruce continues, "To be honest, I thought death would be a mercy for you." Bruce looks straight into Tim's eyes, "Death would have been the kindest thing this country could have given you, Tim. For you – " Bruce shakes his head, "You know what they do to children from the north."</p><p>They fuck them. They breed them. They throw them into battle like wild dogs. They display them like exotic pets. They chain them for work and they cut the meat from their bones to eat as <em>delicacies</em> and snap the horns of their heads for decorations. Tim knows.</p><p>He knows how lucky he is.</p><p>"Do you remember what happened?" Bruce says as Tim's fists curl into his bedding. "You spat in the slaver's face. And you smiled."</p><p>Tim does not remember that. But he does remember getting beaten some more for some reason or other.</p><p>"In the face of death you were not accepting. You were not resigned. You did not fight for your freedom, nor did you welcome it. You took your fate and turned it into a tool for spite. It was not – it was neither a cool detachment, or a fiery passion. It was something in between that I have never seen on a child. It is neither martyrdom nor suicide." Bruce's eyes are hard as he looks at him. "And I remember thinking that it would be such a waste to see you die. To see someone as strong willed and independent as you brought to your death in a land that could offer you more. That could use someone like you to become great."</p><p>It should all feel like compliments, but Tim can feel a rebuttal coming -</p><p>"So I went to the King to plead your case. He expected nothing of you, Tim. No one expected <em>anything</em> of you. Just another slave, another foreign-born child, just another murderer conscripted into joining the army. Even I was satisfied with that. I did not expect anything from you. I half-thought that you would run away. That you would turn on us."</p><p>Tim opens his mouth to protest, <em>he is no oath-breaker</em> -</p><p>Bruce holds up a hand.</p><p>"Despite every expectation you climbed up the ranks. First you made a circle of your own. You created a coterie. Not only did you unify the outcasts, the former slaves and the foreign born. But you also brought together the children of the peasants, the soldiers and novices, the teachers and scholars who were not born to wealth and nobility. And then you made the slums, the black market, the bazars your playground. Your territory." Bruce pauses, raises an eyebrow as Tim colors. "Did you think that I did not know it was <em>you, </em>Tim? A pale foreign boy killing raiders who enter the Imperial city and freeing slaves with the training of a soldier?"</p><p>Tim ducks his head in embarrassment and Bruce goes on.</p><p>"You climbed to the very top, Tim. Through your own strength of will and power of mind. You drew so many people together, creating a network of intelligence and spies unseen by any before you. And you never settled, never accepted anything. Not once in all my years of watching over you have I ever seen you <em>accept</em> anything that came your way. You challenged and scrutinized and tested everything, good and bad alike. You resist everything, Tim. It is, perhaps, one of the things that makes you strongest. It is, I believe, the reason why I can trust you with my family. With my children and with my self. I believe, with my entire being, that if the entire face of the earth were to be razed by fire you would still stand. You endure, Tim. You refuse to change unless you, yourself will it. And gods and goddesses help anyone or anything that tries to bend you to their will."</p><p>Tim tangles his fingers together as Bruce frowns.</p><p>"So why, <em>why</em> – I ask myself, is the boy who I have – who I have <em>raised</em> for the past eleven years suddenly so <em>passive</em>? You sit here and you stare out the window.  You do not ask about court affairs, or pay attention to the reports from your spies. Messages and questions sent to you through your network go unanswered. You stare and shrug and make your mind elsewhere whenever we ask you your opinion of a matter of state. It is unlike you. For you have always taken the matters of the throne and state and people into your hands, whether anyone approved or not. In fact, ever since you have taken the official title of High Consort you have been especially aggressive in your actions to manipulate the court."</p><p>Tim swallows and closes his eyes as Bruce leans forward, hands open in supplication.</p><p>"Tim – I have seen you bleeding out, delirious with pain and spirit, half-unconscious and not-aware of the world. And still you would snarl and rage and fight against the healers demanding the blood of they who brought harm upon you. I have seen you, shivering and shaking like a newborn foal, unable to stand or even see straight, and you would still demand perfection of your soldiers. I have seen you unable to speak for pain and unable to eat, and still you would attend every council meeting. I have seen you retching nothing but bile, unable to even drink a sip of water, and even then you would stand and force your way to the King's side. It would be one thing if you were still sick and fevered, another thing still if you were injured – but you are hale, Tim. You are hale and growing stronger by the day. <em>Why </em>do you lay here without a single word of question?"</p><p>"What do you want from me?" Tim says, lowering his gaze. "Is this not what everyone has always wanted? Am I not quiet? Am I not obedient? Am I not the perfect Consort to my King? Have you all not shaken your heads and sighed, and wished I were to be more docile? Can you not simply be happy that I am well and that the assassin did not kill me as they intended? Must every word upon my lips be some sharp barb of displeasure or some demand for something greater? Is that the only way to please you, Bruce?" Tim waves his hand, a sharp cutting motion through the air before letting it fall back onto his lap.</p><p>"Perhaps I am simply <em>tired</em>. Is it that unacceptable for me to take a break? A moment of respite? Must I always be so malcontent with my lot in life, must I be forever doomed to be unhappy and hungering for more? What sort of glutton must I be to you? Can I not be content with my station? I am at the highest rank I could ever achieve. Higher, even, than if my dam and sire had lived and I stayed in the lands of my birth. I have the wealth of an entire <em>empire</em> at my fingertips. I share a bed with the Immortal King. I am surrounded in luxury and splendor. <em>Can I not rest and be content with this?</em>"</p><p>Bruce's mouth is a hard line, and his eyes are angry and disappointed at once when he stands.</p><p>"<em>No</em>." Tim recoils, as if physically struck, when Bruce speaks. His voice is angry, filled with burning <em>seithr</em>. Disgust and anger, he turns on his heel an leaves the room, shoulders stiff, head held high.</p><p>Tim looks at his hands and wonders why they shake.</p><p>What is wrong with everyone?</p>

</p><p>"Slade is going to be staying with us for a while." Mother says, picking Tim up and holding him at her hip, "Rose just turned ten." She gently tugs his fingers out of his mouth, "You understand?"</p><p>Tim nods, resting his head on her shoulder, rubbing his horns against the soft wolf fur of her mantle.</p><p>"Can I light a candle for her?" Tim asks, Mother's mouth twists and she kisses his head between his horns.</p><p>"Have faith in her."</p><p>Rose is ten, and old enough to seek out <em>Ymir's </em>well. Tim has lost many blood-of-his-kin to that quest. Slade has lost two sons to <em>Ymir's</em> well already, as well as a flesh-brother and two of his mates. Tim never met any of them, but he remembers that when Lilian died, Slade sent a raven and Mother and Father lit a candle for her.</p><p>Tim has lit many candles for kin who have lost their lives seeking <em>Ymir's</em> favor.</p><p>He does not want to lose Rose, also. She is the only one of his parent's blood-kin around his age, and she has never gotten bothered by him when he wanted to play with her. Rose taught him how to tie knots and how to hide in snowdrifts and how to suck sap from trees. Tim curls his fingers into Mother's mantle.</p><p>He knows that Rose has been looking forward to this. It was all she could talk about on her name-day last year. Tim fell asleep on her lap as she was talking about it.</p><p>Tim rubs his horns against Mother's shoulder – they itch terribly and Father has taken to binding them in cloth every morning to make sure Tim does not scratch at them. Tim's horns came late, for a boy. Mother had begun to worry that he would be one of the rare frost-born without the gift of dragon's horns.</p><p>It is the opposite entirely.</p><p>He is <em>Ymir-</em>blessed, given the gift of the horn-crown and the <em>hulgr-</em>touch. It would be easy for him to make his way to <em>Ymir's</em> side. In fact, Tim will probably be sent to <em>Ymir's</em> well to serve as one <em>Ymir's</em> chosen when he is old enough.</p><p>The horns itch as they break through his skin, and sometimes they ache and sometimes they tingle, but mostly they <em>itch</em> terribly.</p><p>Tim wishes Rose would stay, he wishes that she will stay because Rose knows how to make his horns not itch, and she knows how to keep his mind off them.</p><p>That night Tim bows his head against his windowsill and whispers pleas to <em>Ymir</em>.</p><p>Do not let Rose die. Do not let Rose die.</p><p>-</p><p>"I do not care what lies in your hearts or in your beds. I do not care if men or women arouse you or if they do not. I do not <em>care</em> about your sex." Tim says, arms behind his back as he addresses the members of the army that he has chosen to be removed from their ranks. "The King does not care. The army does not care. Any enemies that attack this country will not care. What matters is your dedication to your country and to your people. I do not want, or need, you here if the only reason you wear the insignia of a King's man is because your sire or dam put you here. That sort of false-loyalty is unnecessary and a hindrance." Tim's lips twist in disgust. "The army is not a depository. If you wish to stay, you will stay because you wish to. Because you see the honor of serving your people as just that, an honor. Not a punishment, not a last resort. Not some sort of fate you must resign yourself to."</p><p>Tim pauses, sneers, "And if you are here of your own free will – to watch. To observe. To report. To manipulate. Then know this. <em>I am always watching</em>." Tim bares his teeth and longs for his horns, "And I have many more eyes than <em>you</em>."</p><p>Many of the assembled soldiers in front of him grumble, waves of murmurs among them as they turn to look at each other and shift their weights under his gaze. Tim turns to Jason and Z, lowering his voice to address them, "Give them one day to decide. If possible, give the ones who leave jobs they would actually want. You two know these soldiers best, you have been here longer than I have and know the life here better. If there are any who refuse to leave and you think may be a threat or danger to our ranks, have Prudence or Owens challenge them to trial by combat and get them out of here."</p><p>"And where are you going, sir?" Z asks, Tim smirks.</p><p>"I am going to have a <em>talk</em> with the elite guard." Jason cackles as Z turns to hide his smile. Tim cracks his knuckles and rolls his shoulders, pauses - "If you hear the sounds of someone getting beat into the floor, don't worry. The King made me promise not to permanently maim anyone."</p><p>-</p><p>The first thing Tim must do, he thinks, as he has Jason and Prudence and Z break Tim's chosen up into groups, is teach them how to <em>fight</em>.</p><p>"You are all master combatants." Tim begins, "But you are only at your best against your brothers and sisters in the army. When you are out there, among the people, among the enemies and among the hostile, the fancy footwork and the precise techniques you have learned will mean nothing." Tim walks between their even rows, making eye contact with each of them as he passes. Several of them are older than him, and they most likely understand what he means. It is the younger ones, the ones who were not in his peer group that he is concerned with.</p><p>"There will be times when you cannot engage an opponent using the Imperial style of fighting you have been taught to master." Tim continues, "Times when you are at a disadvantage, or when the Imperial style just does not work. The Imperial style has many weaknesses." Tim stops, "What do you do when your opponent is already past your guards? What do you do when you are on the ground, or if your arms are locked? If your enemy has you by the hair?"</p><p>Tim looks into their faces, "This is where the Imperial style and the teachings of our mentors fail you. And this is where I am going to remind you of what to do. For those of you who have seen me fight, for those of you who have trained with me, you already know what I speak of. <em>Grappling</em>."</p><p>He catches a brief look of shock, some derision, and some disbelief across many faces. Understandable.</p><p>"You have been trained to believe that grappling is unrefined. That brawling is for the peasants and uneducated." Tim says, moving to the front of the lines of soldiers. "That it is dishonorable and low. Like pulling hair and using sand to blind an opponent. But that is wrong." Tim stands on top of a crate to look over their heads. "When it comes down to it, there is one thing you must all remember. Survive."</p><p>Tim makes eye contact with each of them.</p><p>"The reason why you are all here is because I am going to teach you to grapple. I am going to remind you of every single instinct that you have been told is <em>wrong </em>and <em>incorrect</em>. I am going to teach you, because I believe that you will learn this quickly. And you, in turn, will teach your squads and your disciples. Today you are going to learn to fight with everything you have. Any questions?"</p><p>"Is grappling not dishonorable, Commander?" One of the soldiers in front asks, and Tim turns to him.</p><p>"No." Tim answers, "Though I am sure you all think that. But let me tell you something, soldier. There is no such thing as <em>dishonor</em> in survival. You are <em>soldiers</em> in the King's army. If we are ever sent out to go to war, to fight for our people, then it does not matter what we do. Your goal, soldier, is to survive. And in order to do that you will do <em>whatever it takes</em>. I do not care, <em>no one will care</em>, if you had to crush a man's balls, spit in his face, pull his hair, or fucking point and shout <em>look over there</em> and run. Because you will have survived and come back to regroup and prepare to <em>win</em>." Tim raises his chin. "I am saying this now, as Commander of the King's armies and as the King's blade."</p><p>The training field is quiet as Tim raises his voice -</p><p>"It does not matter what you do or how you do it, no one will judge the way you fight in a life or death situation. As long as you <em>come home</em>. Do you understand? <em>Do whatever you have to do to come home</em>."</p><p>-</p><p>With the title of the King's Blade, Tim also inherits control over the several whisperers throughout the empire.</p><p>"They are uncoordinated and their codes are too complex for such simple messages." Tim complains to Ubu, who has been the master of the whisperers before him. Ubu, Tim knows, is Ra's' only surviving son. But what his name was before he became one of the Ubu, Tim does not know. No one speaks of his birth-name, and the only other thing Tim has ever heard him be referred to is "the albino".</p><p>The Ubu all wear complete face masks, and so Tim cannot read the man's expression, but he has the distinct feeling he is being laughed at.</p><p>Like father like son, apparently.</p><p>"Apologies, King's blade." Ubu says, "How would you like to correct this oversight?"</p><p>"Quickly." Tim mutters, pinching the bridge of his nose. There are many things he must do in order to get the empire's forces up to his standards. "For one thing, we need to teach them more languages than just the Imperial standard and the dialects. How many of the whisperers know the language of the west? Or the languages of Edas?"</p><p>"A few, here and there. The whisperers are few and far in between, King's blade." Ubu replies, reaching out to mark the map, "Not many complete their training and join the ranks properly. The whisperers teach many apprentices who never gain their marks. Either through lack of ambition, unwillingness to commit to the order, or lack of skill."</p><p>Tim clicks his tongue – "The order of whispers is currently open to only men, is it not?"</p><p>"Yes." Ubu replies, "Unmarried men of any rank."</p><p>"Expand it to include married men and women. Change the age of acceptance up to thirteen years of age instead of ten." Tim sighs. In between bringing the army up to standard, adjusting the ranks, and altering lesson plans, Tim had hoped that reorganizing the whispers would be relaxing. It is clear that it is not. "How this country even functions is beyond my understanding. And the ranks of the Ubu, how fare they?"</p><p>"Well, King's blade." Ubu replies, "But I cannot tell you more, and you know this already."</p><p>"It was worth a shot." Tim sighs, resting his chin on his hand. The Ubu are the King's and the King's alone to control. Tim does not think he has ever even seen an Ubu's face before. Their signature white garb is always such a surprise to see. When Tim was younger it always made him anxious. "But you would tell me if something was wrong, yes?"</p><p>He has a feeling that Ubu is laughing at him, again.</p><p>"If the King wishes you to know, Commander, you would know." Ubu tilts his head, "And if something were truly wrong among our ranks, I do think you would notice it indeed."</p><p>-</p><p>"I worry for you, most beloved." Ra's says, touching his knuckles to Tim's forehead. "You do not wear your true form."</p><p>"I am tired, and it is not worth the effort of working around the bindings." Tim replies, and he is. Truly, he does feel tired. Bruce has not spoken to him since that argument four days ago, and Cassandra has been giving him frustrated looks ever since. The only other person he has seen is Jason, who is running himself ragged with his duties as the commander of the Consort's Guard and Tim's temporary stand in. Ra's has been scarce, playing catch up on work he has put off and trying to keep the growing pile from continuing to build upon itself. "What is this, you are normally so upset with me when I do wear my true skin when I can frighten the servants, and now you are upset that I am not?"</p><p>Bruce's words ring in the back of Tim's mind, and Ra's does not answer.</p><p>"Where are you going?" Tim asks, as Ra's stands again. He has not seen Ra's in days, which he does not normally mind – but he is tired and it feels like so long since he last spoken to his lord-husband. "Stay."</p><p>Ra's gives him a blank look that makes Tim feel small and weak and <em>wrong</em>.</p><p>"You are – " Ra's shakes his head, "I must go. I have work that must be completed."</p><p>"Will you come back?" Tim asks, reaching for him, "Have dinner with me."</p><p>Ra's evades Tim's hands, "I am busy, consort. I apologize. Perhaps tomorrow. Rest."</p><p>Ra's leaves and Tim is alone.</p><p>Tim falls back upon his bedding and bites his cheek.</p><p>-</p><p>"I do not ask for perfection." Tim says, standing toe to toe with the so-called elite of the King's guard as he stares into their helmeted faces. "I will not ask that of you. Nor will I ask for your loyalty. I know many of you hate me. It should be <em>you</em> who is the Commander of the King's armies, the King's blade. Many of you hate me and my pale skin and my blue eyes. You hate the brands on my back and you hate the horns you cannot see upon my brow. I know that. I <em>do not care</em>. I am not here to ask for your loyalty. I am not here to ask for your respect. I am not here to ask for you to <em>trust</em> me or for you to <em>understand me</em>."</p><p>Tim assumes his stance at the head of them, many of them look at him with apprehension and anger in their faces. He has just finished beating them all into the ground, after all. He thinks it would be odd if they did <em>not</em> resent him for showing them just how easily he can win. It is only right that their pride sings.</p><p>"I am not going to ask you to fear me. I am not going to ask for you to like me. We are not going to become <em>friends</em>." Tim's lips curl around the word, and he sees his expression matched on many faces. "I am here to ask one thing of you, and one thing only. This is the one creed you will hold above all others. Forget everything you have been told and taught, and remember this one thing only."</p><p>Tim makes sure he has their attention before speaking.</p><p>"<em>Protect</em>." Tim says, and pauses to make sure it has settled in. "Protect. You are the elite guard. You represent the best of your people. You represent the <em>King</em>. And a country is only as good as its people. In and out of uniform, in and out of the palace walls – as long as you draw breath <em>protect</em>. Protect the innocent. Protect men. Protect women. Protect children. Protect the sick. Protect the poor. Protect the rich. Protect those who have traveled to these lands in peace. But <em>protect them</em>. Think of the one thing you must not lose. It can be your family.  Your mother. Your father. Your brother. Your sister. Your lover. Your son. Your daughter. Your horse. Your sword. Your pride. Your friend. Your King. I do not care who. But think of that thing which you must not lose. And imagine that on the line every time. Because it is." Tim hits the tip of his scabbard against the ground. "At every single moment of every single day, you are the face of the King. To shame him by failing to protect your people, to protect your land, you put harm to that thing which you cannot lose."</p><p>Tim breathes, hands curling over the pommel of his blade as he continues.</p><p>"I do not care what you do or how you do it. I have told you this before. I have told everyone who bears the crest of the royal house upon their breast these words. <em>It does not matter</em>. And now I tell it to you. Have conviction in your actions. And allow your love of that thing you cannot lose drive you. If you should ever turn your blade against King and country, I want you to make sure it is worth it. That it has purpose. And remember that every time you cross blades with another, that enemy is also fighting for that thing which they cannot lose. This is not a game, this is not a competition. And I will not have any of you treat it as such. These are the true risks, and these are the things you <em>will</em> lose if you fail. Am I understood?"</p><p>-</p><p>Adulthood, unlike his horns, comes early to Tim. His voice crackles and changes pitch with almost every breath. For weeks many of his acquaintances think he has gone mute. Several of his tutors are struck dumb with the fear that he has returned to his original stubbornness and that they will be brought before the King to be punished for teaching him poorly like his original tutors.</p><p>(Many of his friends had congratulated him on getting their most hated teachers released. He was not, after all, the only student written off as daft because he was not born to wealth.)</p><p>Jason teases him for ages until Tim reminds the older boy of <em>his</em> changes and how poorly that went, and Jason shuts up very quickly. Cassandra, for all that she is normally a reprieve and very gentle teases them <em>both</em> about it endlessly. Womanhood has been kind to her, and aside from her monthly bleeding and the gradual swell of her breasts, she remains mostly unchanged. She is just as graceful now as she was when Tim first met her, though she draws more stares whenever she strips to her breast bindings now.</p><p>He does not grow very much, to his dismay. But Jason points out that it is better than growing too fast. Tim vividly remembers nights when Jason would groan and collapse on top of him, hot and heavy and reeking of sweat and unwilling to move because his bones hurt. Tim is glad he does not have to go through with that, but he absolutely despises how much his peers tower above him now.</p><p>The only upside is that many of his peers are unused to their new height and do not know how to fight against a smaller opponent. Tim's change in height is not nearly enough to make him stumble or to make him trip over himself. His balance is still the same and his reach has not changed as much. Spars are much more amusing, now. Especially when he goes up against the other trainees who have not yet realized it is unwise to look down on him as a foreigner.</p><p>If there is anything that frustrates him more than the crack of his voice and his lack of growth, however, it is – it is the <em>talk of sex</em>. It flies around the barracks and the training field whenever the girls are not present.</p><p>"It is just as bad with the girls, you know. Probably worse because we talk about our monthly bleeding." Prudence says when they get paired up for stretches. Tim is not the shortest of the boys, but he is around the right size and weight to be sparring with the older girls, now. Prudence weighs less than he does, but she is slightly taller and she has always made their teachers sigh with her outright violence. Most other girls refuse to train with her just because of how quick she is to turn crass and resort to scratching and biting.</p><p>Tim does not mind, mostly because he bites back. Much to their teacher's consternation.</p><p>"I do not understand what the fuss is about." Tim mutters. "It is just <em>sex</em>. Everyone does it. Why are they so – <em>so</em>." Tim makes a frustrated noise. "You find someone you like and you have sex and it is over. Why is it treated like such a <em>secret</em>?"</p><p>"Is it open in the north?" Prudence asks, "If so, sign me up for a one way trip."</p><p>"It is not exactly open, but it is not a secret." Tim replies. He was very young when he was taken from the north. He does not remember everything. But he does know that he already knew what sex was and that it was a common thing between bonded and un-bonded couples alike. "Where do they <em>think</em> babes come from?"</p><p>"Magic." Prudence wiggles her fingers, stops, wrinkles her nose instead. "Ugh. I sound like a child. But yes. Let me tell you the story of the stork and the cabbage patch, ignorant one – "</p><p>Tim is almost completely certain that Prudence is leading him on, but gets ready to listen anyway.</p><p>He would rather talk about this than who put what into who's something.</p><p>-</p>

</p><p>"Ah, little one," Tim laughs, picking Helena up around the waist and tossing her into the air, "You are quite a few years too late to think that you could escape me using the secret passage ways."</p><p>Helena shrieks, cheeks flushing red as she spreads her small hands into the air, her laughter seems to echo around them as he catches her and tosses her again.</p><p>"No <em>fair</em>." Helena squeals, small arms curling around his neck when he catches her again. "How do you always catch me?"</p><p>He was once the Commander of the King's army, and that would be a suitable answer -</p><p>"Did you think that Jason and Cassandra did not drag me through those passages when I was younger?" Tim replies, setting Helena down on the tile, "What are you doing here? Normally you run <em>away</em> from baths, even when you need them."</p><p>Helena whines, twisting around to press her face into his side. Tim hums, resting his hand on the back of her head.</p><p>"Shall I guess?" Tim asks, feels her giggles against his skin as he pretends to think, "Perhaps you are running from a large monster? A dragon? Is there a dragon chasing after you, little sister?" Helena laughs in the way only children can laugh, like they think they are being quiet and secretive, but truly they are just as brilliant as little stars. "<em>Goddess!</em> We must go the the King and ask him for help if that is so! We have to alert the guards!"</p><p>Out of the corner of his eye, Tim sees the flash of black and gold that means that Cassandra has gone to tell Bruce or whoever is Helena's keeper today that the little girl is found and in safe hands.</p><p>"No." Helena whines, crawling into his lap when he attempts to stand. One of her strong little arms hits against his stomach, and Tim falls back, wincing as Helena squirms. "No! No! Not <em>grandpa</em>."</p><p>Tim does not think he will ever get over hearing Helena call Ra's <em>grandpa</em>. And he does not think that Ra's will ever get tired of hearing it, either. Though the two do not share any flesh, Tim thinks that he has never seen Ra's be so <em>doting</em>.</p><p>(While it is true that Ra's sometimes <em>dotes</em> on Tim, Tim is fairly certain that most of the time it is in jest and it is never as purely affectionate as it is with Helena.)</p><p>"But what about the dragon, Helena?" Tim mock-whispers, "I would be afraid to face a dragon alone."</p><p>"<em>No</em>." Helena says, looking up at him through her mess of brown curls – she has clearly escaped being properly groomed for at least two days, and Tim feels bad for whoever is going to get a tongue-lashing for letting the daughter of the consorts run around like a wildling – "That is not true! Damian says you killed one before!" She reaches up to touch her hands to the sides of his face, "Damian says that you have dragon horns! And dragon breath and if I get you mad you will be all <em>roar! Arrrrgh!</em> And that you are super strong!"</p><p>Tim wonders what kind of stories, exactly, Jason has been telling Damian, and in turn how much Damian is editing them for his little sister.</p><p>"Oh, <em>no!</em> I could <em>never</em> kill a dragon." Tim says, picking Helena up again as he goes towards the water. Perhaps if he distracts her enough she will not notice. "Dragons are my <em>friends</em>, Helena. That would be <em>mean</em>. Are you <em>sure</em> you are running from a dragon?"</p><p>Helena covers her face with her hands, "Maybe!"</p><p>Chances are Helena was running from her attendants, judging from her state of dress – they were trying to get her into a bath again. Tim wonders how he did not hear any commotion, the baths for the other consorts is only just down the hall from this one, and Helena is loud enough on her own without yelling attendants coming after her.</p><p>"Hm, if it was not a dragon," Tim keeps his grip steady around her, for all that she is a three year old babe with absolutely no training, she can be as slippery as an eel when she wants to be and as spry as a cat. "Then what could it be, I wonder? Was it fierce some? Was it <em>angry</em>?"</p><p>While Helena is distracted, pondering over how to best spin her tale in her favor, Tim crouches down and slips into the water, startling Helena into shrieking. Tim flinches, but keeps his hold on her as she wails -</p><p>"<em>No! Tim!</em>" Helena moans, and to hear her weep and sob one would think that he was bringing her to her death.</p><p>"Come on, Helena. It is just water." Tim says, one arm around her as he reaches for one of the washcloths. He almost wishes that he did not dismiss the attendants, bathing Helena with two hands is a trying task already. Bathing her while in the water yourself, with only one arm to spare is going to be a trial. "When has water ever hurt you?"</p><p>"I don't want to." Helena whines, before going limp against Tim's shoulder. He is relieved that this is the sort of tantrums she has taken to having with him rather than the kinds she throws against Dick and Cassandra. He would rather not get one of her fists or feet to the face and accidentally drop her. "I do not like taking a bath."</p><p>"Bear with it, for me and perhaps I will tell you about the dragons of my birthplace." Tim says. He has been careful about not showing Helena his true face or speaking overly much about his home around her. To be honest, he is not sure how to handle the questions that will come, or how he will handle the inevitable inability for him to explain things in the languages she knows.</p><p>The culture and language gap is just to large to satisfy the girl.</p><p>And Tim is -</p><p>He is -</p><p>Afraid. Afraid of what she might react to – how she might react to his face. It is silly, he knows. But he thinks that this is part of the territory of becoming a big brother.</p><p>(It is different with Damian. Tim was only ten when the little <em>da'mi</em> was born, and he did not spend much time around the boy as he was growing. Tim was much closer to the royal family when Helena was born, and he was the Commander, then High Consort as she was learning to speak and walk. He loves them both as his siblings, but it is Helena he babies.)</p><p>Tim is not unaware of the fact that his culture is more – more violent than theirs. It is colder and harsher, though to him it does not seem that way. He does not think Helena is ready to hear those sort of stories.</p><p>(Stories of <em>Ymir's</em> gift gone wrong. Those who were unable to complete their <em>hammasks</em> or suitably plead favor from those who came during the first <em>hammrammr</em>. Stories of the hunts and stories of battles for neither blood nor glory. Stories of the ancient ones who roam the nights when <em>Ymir's</em> eye closes and they arm themselves with frost and lightning, and set loose their hounds and other bonded creatures.)</p><p>Helena quiets, but her face is set into a firm pout that makes Tim think of Damian. Tim smiles as he sets about to scrubbing dirt and sticky-sweet-residue off her hands. She will speak when she wishes to, and Tim can outwait a little girl.</p><p>True enough, by the time Tim has her sitting on the tile and is washing her hair, Helena is firing off questions about mother-dragons and what the babies look like and how heavy they are and what they eat and their names and if their mothers tuck them into bed and if they get bed time stories.</p><p>"You are a miracle worker, consort." Tim looks up to smile at Selina, leaning against one of the open archways. Helena reaches out for her mother, and Tim releases her. He is certain that Selina can finish the job, and leave Tim to his own bathing. "Helena, you naughty girl, you ran from your attendants again."</p><p>"Helena, I thought it was a dragon!" Tim fake-gasps, slipping back into the bath and reaching for a new washcloth. "I feel terribly mislead."</p><p>Helena cups her hands and whispers – as much as a three year old is capable of whispering – into Selina's ear – "Tim thought I was being chased by a dragon, but I was not, mama, and he told me that mama dragons do not tell bedtime stories to their babies. Do you think that is true?"</p><p>"I would not know." Selina says, taking Tim's place on the low stool and setting Helena down between her legs to rinse her hair. She looks at Tim out of the corner of her eye before turning back to Helena, deftly tilting her head back as she washes soap out of the girl's hair, "I would not know, darling. I think Tim is right, though. Because Tim is of the dragon-born."</p><p>"Dragon-born? Tim is a dragon?" Helena gasps, small hands flailing out, "Tim! You did not tell me you were a dragon! Can you fly? Do you have scales? Tim! <em>Can you breathe fire?</em>"</p><p>Tim throws a glare at Selina's way as the woman smirks. Tim resigns himself to weeks, if not months, of Helena trying to startle him into something like breathing fire.</p><p>-</p><p>It strikes him dumb, and it strikes him in the middle of the day. It has been weeks since he has last seen Ra's' for anything longer than a few minutes at a time, and he has been visited by many of his friends who all leave after looking at him like he is a stranger.</p><p>It strikes him like a hot brand. This realization.</p><p>Over the past few weeks Tim has slowly been regaining his strength, to walk and move. Jason and Cassandra have been urging him to exercise, to work through katas and spar with them. But he has been – he has been unwilling and tired. Today is the first time he has ventured into his gardens. He has been reluctant to do so, until now. But he is bored and there is no one to talk to.</p><p>He could not get any work done on any of the bond-cloths he was supposed to be working on. He cannot focus enough to read or write, or to even sleep.</p><p>There is something inside of him that is <em>restless</em>. His clothes feel heavy and his limbs itch with a need to move. To do something. To do <em>what</em> is the question.</p><p>Tim stands on the cool marble, looking out into the garden and listening for the sounds of the animals he knows have been returned here after Ra's released his seals. The seals are closed once again, but it would not take much effort at all to work around them. Tim breathes, and the air tastes flat.</p><p>Something is wrong, and he knows – he knows that everyone is concerned for him. Upset and concerned. But Tim cannot understand what it is.</p><p>The sun hurts his eyes, and Tim raises an arm to shield himself from the light. Something worries the back of his mind, a strange nagging feeling that he should not be doing this. That it would be better for him to just go back inside and take a nap, or perhaps call for one of the other Consorts and force them to speak to him. Or maybe a nice bath would be nice.</p><p>Tim shakes his head, stepping forward into the light. It irritates his skin, and with every step that feeling of apprehension, that nagging tug on his mind gets stronger. Louder. It is – it is odd. The feeling is wrong. Why is it wrong – what <em>is</em> it, exactly, Tim cannot say.</p><p>Tim is almost where the tiles give way to grass, and the feeling of wrongness is fairly screaming at him – Tim's knees buckle without warning, and Tim yelps in pain when his knees strike the floor. Tim falls forward, hands colliding against the grass and it feels like something has set him on <em>fire</em>.</p><p>Tim screams, and his vision whites out.</p><p>It is a cacophony of sound, rushing into his ears – birds? Falcons? Some sort of high shriek, a roar. Something heavy, so very heavy and low that it thunders through Tim's veins. A cat? There is a cat. The sound of water, something breaking – something like metal on stone, friction. More sounds, breaking branches, leaves, birds taking flight, the roar of wind and the depths. Roaring. Bellowing. <em>Raging</em>. Something ancient – something that reaches into him and <em>pulls</em>. Not just pulls but rips and tears and yanks at something un-speakable and un-knowable within him. Something nameless and eternal that Tim has never needed to speak of.</p><p><em>Ymir</em>.</p><p>Tim is not inside himself, and he cannot – Tim is not within his own body, or perhaps he is and the pain is too much.</p><p>Tim sees his bones, his veins – the lines of energy that connect all things, magic and the <em>seithr</em> that runs through everything that ever was. Tim's vision is a changing, shifting mass of color – heat, bone, flesh, <em>seithr</em>, energy, blood, something <em>other</em>, and something green. Something green and powerful that makes him feel like he is standing at the edge of the world -</p><p>It is a familiar feeling, that Tim belatedly realizes is something he has only experienced when standing before the Lazarus flame of the royal house. His house. It is his flame. Lazarus' flame.</p><p>The flame pushes into him, from where his hands touch the earth, the raw earth and how could Tim ever forget that – forget <em>this</em>? The feeling of a primal one's <em>seithr</em> pushing through his own and Tim – Tim realizes that this is wrong.</p><p>A voice that is not his own, that is foreign and <em>wrong</em>, screams for him to cut it off. To push the Lazarus away, to run, to retreat into the marble and tile walls of the Consort's Gallery.</p><p>But the Lazarus flame bellows through his veins, jade and emerald greens that threaten to burn the world white as they reach into Tim to drag <em>Ymir</em> out.</p><p>Tim feels it, in the core of himself. <em>Ymir</em>. The gift he was given at birth, the gift denoted by the curl of his horns and the strength of his frost. Tim feels it – <em>Ymir</em> and Mac-<em>amme</em>, mother and father and mother-dragon. Lazarus. <em>Ymir</em>. The flame reaches into the core of him, and with something that tastes like horror and disgust, Tim realizes that it is all trapped. Wrapped up inside of him with sick <em>seithr</em>. Foreign <em>seithr</em>.</p><p>It is not his, and how it survived the purge he experienced earlier is beyond him -</p><p>More than that Tim feels <em>rage</em>.</p><p>This – this is familiar. It has only come upon him once before.</p><p>When Tim was eight, and the world was red and white and burning.</p><p>Tim's fingers curl into the earth and Tim opens himself to Lazarus.</p><p>Come, Tim thinks. I will take your flame. I will take your fire.</p><p>Tim digs his fingers into the grass and earth, and feels the world's <em>seithr</em>, the world's magic flowing into him. It is overpowering and it crests and crashes on him like waves on stone. Tim takes it, and he turns himself inward and follows the power. The <em>seithr</em>.</p><p>The foreign <em>seithr</em> is slippery, like oil, and insidious – gray and cloying. Tim can feel his <em>self</em> behind it. His own <em>seithr</em>. Frost and thunder, the breath of dragons and the heart of <em>hulgr</em>. <em>Ymir</em>. It fights against the foreign <em>seithr</em>, but it is weakened and small. Dying.</p><p>Lazarus flames and rages, eating and ravaging the poisonous <em>seithr</em>, this corrupting magic, and Tim bites his lips so hard he tastes blood.</p><p>Burn, Tim thinks. Burn it all.</p><p>I will not fall. I will not melt, I will not fade.</p><p>I am <em>Tim</em>, Tim thinks, snarling.</p><p>"I am Tim, flesh of Janet, flesh of Jack." Tim hisses as he drags himself forward onto the grass, away from the marble and tile and gold of the Gallery. "I am the son of <em>dragons</em>. I am the chosen of <em>Ymir</em>. I am <em>hulgr-</em>touched and blessed by <em>hammrammr</em>."</p><p>Tim draws himself up and tears his robes from his body, feet like lead and so <em>painful</em> – his bones, it feels like his bones are breaking and twisting within his <em>flesh</em> – as he staggers up and towards the water. The Lazarus burns, seeking out his flesh and pouring itself into him like molten metal, heavy and angry, with every step.</p><p>The voice rages inside his skull, and it feels like something is dragging its nails across his bones. Tim feels the skin at his temples breaking, the crest of his horns hurting like never before. Blood. There is blood and Tim feels <em>angrier</em>.</p><p>"I am the King's <em>blade</em>." Tim hisses as the voice yells at him to go back, to cut Lazarus off, "I am the master of whispers, the Commander of the King's armies. I am blood to <em>legends</em>. I have the empire of the Immortal King on its <em>knees</em>. I will not <em>bow</em> to this."</p><p>The touch of water against his skin is like acid. It eats at his skin, and through the shifting world in front of him, Tim can see the <em>seithr</em> rushing at him, angry and churning, chaotic.</p><p>"I am the voice of <em>Ymir</em>, and I have survived worse than <em>you</em>." Tim scratches against his chest, digging his nails in until he can feel flesh part. The water crawls up his body and seeps into his wounds, burning him all the way. Tim watches his pale skin pinken and bubble. The <em>seithr</em> of the Lazarus turns the water around him green, and summons vapors that smell like sulfur and burning flesh – Tim's burning flesh. "Burn me."</p><p>He knows what the Lazarus flame is capable of. How strong it truly is. It is holding back, and that is the reason for which the <em>thing</em> inside of him continues to exist. To keep Tim's <em>soul</em>, to keep Tim's <em>seithr</em> from him. The Lazarus must burn it completely, it must burn <em>through</em> him.</p><p>If he had the strength for it, Tim would laugh. For the Lazarus is many things, but kind is not one of them. Perhaps it holds back out of concern for its master, or perhaps because it does not trust Tim's abilities. There is no need for such hesitation.</p><p>He would never allow the Lazarus' flames to hurt him. To slay him.</p><p>(Tim did not fall before the raiders. He did not fall before any of the hundreds of opponents set before him. If he did not fall to the traps of the court life, to the tests set before him by his trainers and tutors and fellow soldiers – if Tim did not fall to the ruby-scale, and if he did not fall to the original fever, Tim will not fall <em>here</em>.)</p><p>Tim throws his arms open for the Lazarus flame, "Burn me. Burn it out of me, <em>Lazarus</em>."</p><p>He closes his eyes, curls his hands into fists and bites his cheek. God does it burn. It hurts like nothing else. It hurts worse than the brands, than the beatings at the hands of raiders. It hurts more than accepting the mother-dragon's <em>seithr</em>. It hurts more than when he was poisoned and when Ra's took him into the water those weeks ago.</p><p>"I will endure." Tim snarls, "I am <em>the North</em>. And <em>I will not forgive</em>."</p>

</p><p>Tim <em>hates</em> horseback riding. He hates it, and he's pretty sure the poor animal he has to ride hates it as much as <em>he</em> does.</p><p>"What kind of soldier <em>doesn't</em> know how to ride a horse? Or any kind of mount, for that matter?" Owens teases as Tim nervously stares at the horse. It is large and brown and stares at him with one of its liquid black eyes. "You are a northern savage, come on, show us that bravery."</p><p>"Animals are for fighting and hunting, not <em>riding</em>." Tim protests as Z patiently waits for him to come into the stables properly. "I have my own feet. I can walk and run."</p><p>"Not as fast as a <em>horse</em>." Z says, "Everyone else has already learned except you."</p><p>"Yeah, you really wanna be dead last?" Owens replies, pushing Tim's shoulder. Tim keeps his feet firmly planted on the dirt outside the stable door. "Seriously, Tim. It is not that hard nor as terrible as you seem to think it is."</p><p>"I do not trust you." Tim replies, "You said that about hot-flakes, too, and I could not taste anything for two weeks. <em>Two weeks</em>, Owens. I could not even taste the sweets Jason and Cassandra gave me for my name-day."</p><p>"I said I was sorry, you baby." Owens complains, "Come on, Tim. Daylight is burning."</p><p>Tim sighs and steps into the stables.</p><p>"You truly do not have horses in the north?" Z asks, handing Tim some apple halves.</p><p>"No. We do not use mounts in the north." Tim replies, "The things big enough to ride are predators and will most likely kill you if you try. I suppose one could try riding an <em>aruels</em> or one of the larger stags, but they would most likely gore you first. It is harder to fight and hunt on a mount, is it not?"</p><p>How do you hide, for one thing, how do you dodge, another.</p><p>"Well. Welcome to the south, land of the nonsensical and odd." Owens says, as Tim approaches the horse, apple held out between them as a peace offering. "Do not worry, Pierha is very gentle. We are not so mean as to start you off on a warhorse or one of the meaner ones."</p><p>Z's lips twitch upwards, "No, we save those for later. I, personally, am looking forward to when you are deemed ready enough to try riding one of the chimeras."</p><p>Tim will probably end up flat on his back and seeing triple.</p><p>Pierha clicks her teeth at him when he runs out of apple.</p><p>"This is going to go so <em>badly</em>."</p><p>-</p><p>"You must eat." Slade says, forcing Tim's hands to curl around a cup of milk and honey. "Blood-of-my-blood, son-of-my-blood, brother-of-my-blood. You are so thin, and you shrink in on yourself before my eyes. You <em>must</em> eat or you will soon join the wanderers on the nights when <em>Ymir's</em> eye closes. And I fear no flame and no spirit may guide you home."</p><p>Tim shakes his head, "I am not hungry. I know not of which you speak, Slade. You are overreacting. I am full."</p><p>And he is, his stomach feels full and he has no desire to eat or drink. Tim thinks that the purging of his <em>seithr</em> has left him with excess energy. He feels stronger, now. Better. Full – almost <em>too</em> full.</p><p>Slade frowns, touching Tim's brow where his horns would be cresting, "Please."</p><p>Tim blinks, surprised – there is no word for <em>please</em> in their tongue, and it is odd to hear Slade say it.</p><p>Tim reluctantly brings the warm cup to his lips, and sips at the liquid. His stomach churns, and he feels the urge to throw up. His throat closes and Tim forces himself to swallow.</p><p>"It is good." Tim says, blinking away water from his eyes, "But I am full. I will drink it later, perhaps."</p><p>Slade sighs. They both know Tim has no intention of drinking it later.</p><p>"You are dying before my eyes, my-blood." Slade says, "Your dam and sire would have my horns."</p><p>"You have done me no wrong. I am simply <em>not hungry</em>." Tim says for what feels the hundredth time – and considering how many people have been by to try and get him to eat, he thinks that he might not be wrong. "I ate some fruit earlier."</p><p>A few slices of apple, a couple of grapes, and half of a strawberry tart.</p><p>They were good, but Tim's stomach rebels at the thought of them. In time, Tim thinks, the energy gained by the purification will lessen and he will eat more. But for now, he is full to the point of bursting and he does not look forward to vomiting on himself.</p><p>-</p><p>He is no stranger to sex. Tim has had lovers, though few and far in between. Being a soldier, and then the King's Commander and the King's Blade, has not given him much time for such things.</p><p>Though he is willing to admit he probably made it harder on himself. After all, he refused to go to any pleasure house, which would probably have been pretty easy to do. But Tim has been going to the slums and pleasure houses since he was ten. He has made good friends of the men and women who deal in the ways of physical pleasure, bartering with information and using their buildings to move slaves in and out of the cities. His network of whispers is built on their backs, and it would be strange to see any of them for sex.</p><p>They practically helped make him who he is today, after all. Tim does not think he would be able to have sex with the women who he held bread baskets for at the market or learned how to pickpocket from.</p><p>Tim has had lovers of both sexes – and he finds that they are both fine. Tim does not mind either, but in the end it is simpler to just be by himself.</p><p>He did not have the time for lovers, to give them the attention they deserve, and he did not think that he could ever give all of himself to a single person, completely.</p><p>But as Tim traces his fingers over Ra's' skin, Tim thinks that it is different, now.</p><p>He is no longer the Commander. And he thinks that being the King's blade is hardly any different from simply being himself.</p><p>Tim looks into Ra's' eyes, and shifts. Tim breathes, and the air between them mists for a moment as the temperature drops. Tim feels Ra's' skin heat underneath his palm as the man's temperature rises.</p><p>They are well suited, Tim thinks. Ra's, a master of the primeval power of the Lazarus. Tim, frost-born and blessed by <em>Ymir</em>. Ra's touches his horns, tracing their curve and their fluted texture. Tim cannot feel it, except as the barest pressure and the heavy friction-heat of their opposing magics.</p><p>"Are you afraid?" Tim asks, settling himself over Ra's' thighs as the man traces his features with his palms. "I might freeze it off, you know."</p><p>Ra's quirks an eyebrow, "I would say that you might try, but I would rather not encourage you."</p><p>This is what Tim does not give, Tim thinks as he leans forward. He can taste the heat of Ra's' magic, the intensity and purity of his <em>seithr</em> in the air. Ra's' hands are hot, like suns, where they rest on his hips.</p><p>"I am not afraid." Tim whispers, ducking his head down to press his teeth against the skin of Ra's' throat. "And you have made me wait far too long."</p><p>-</p><p>Two nights before Tim is to be made High Consort of the realm, Rose sits with him underneath the sky and throws knucklebones onto the grass.</p><p>"Are you throwing the bones for my future?"</p><p>"No." Rose says, "It is for the calm of my mind. The Twin-Ravens sent me a vision."</p><p>Tim stills as Rose reaches up to flip back the eye patch that covers the hole left by her gift to <em>Ymir</em>. Tim stares into the darkness of the socket, and feels the essence of <em>Ymir</em> within him, the frost and thunder locked behind his seals and trapped inside his bones, respond.</p><p>"I am not here to tell you not to wed the Immortal King. For that is not the way of the north." Rose says, looking into him with the power of the ancient ones. "But I am here to caution you. If you wed the Immortal King you will be tried and enslaved, you will be beaten down and fire will ravage you. You will burn and you will not emerge unscathed. You will be brought low and weakened until your are naught but air. You will turn into nothing but a puppet."</p><p>Tim's nails dig into his palms, "I refuse that future. Can you tell me more?"</p><p>Rose's eye falls closed as she replaces the eye patch. "I can tell you that I love you, and that you are closer to me than even my own sire. And I can tell you that you will meet your end in this land of flames. I can tell you that you will bring this country to its knees and that you will never again see the lands of your birth. But I cannot tell you anything that you do not already know."</p><p>"So you tell me that wedding the King will be my end?"</p><p>"It will be the end of you as you know it." Rose replies, "Whether that is the end or not, I cannot and will not say. The Twin-Ravens keep many secrets from me, for all that I am their favorite."</p><p>Tim digs his thumb into the dirt, "I will not call it off."</p><p>"I do not ask you to." Rose replies. "Only that you be sure of what your actions will bring to your doorstep. You are <em>Ymir-blessed</em>, tell me what the winter in your bones tells you."</p><p>He thinks of not having Ra's at his side. He thinks about not being the King's blade, and he thinks about not spending his days and nights with his found-family. Tim thinks about Helena's round face and her unsteady steps. He tastes the sweets Dick brings back from all the corners of the world and the bright, contagious joy that spreads over Dick's entire <em>body</em> when he comes back. He pictures the look of peace on Cassandra's face whenever she sees them all together and laughing. Tim thinks about Jason's hand on his head and the fond look in his eyes whenever he calls Tim his blood-brother.</p><p>Tim's memory brings forward the feeling of steam and tile, and when Selina – a stranger to him – held him as he wept over his losses. That first time, that last time, all those years ago when he knew nothing of this realm and nothing of its people. He thinks about how Bruce held him close and apologized for his failures when Tim never blamed him to start with.</p><p>He thinks about Prudence and Z and Owens and how they have taught him so much, and stayed at his side and laughed and defended him from the taunts and cruelty of their peers.</p><p>Tim thinks about Harper and Cullen and all of the people he has met and come to know in the city.</p><p>He thinks about the way Ra's' eyes glowed as he threw open the large doors underneath the castle to bathe Tim in the power of the Lazarus flame of his house.</p><p>Tim thinks about the pain that Rose foretells, and he thinks about the disaster he will bring to these people. And he thinks about leaving – for he knows, Tim knows without a doubt, that if he were to request it, the King would grant him his freedom. Tim would once again know his frost-skin and would taste the <em>seithr</em> of dragons on his tongue. He would know <em>Ymir's</em> touch and he would see Mac-<em>amme</em> and her kin. He would know the frost and stone of  his lands as he knows the twisting and living maze that is the Imperial Palace.</p><p>He would track thunderbirds and he would stalk <em>aurels</em> in the night. Tim would make paper dolls for <em>domovyk</em> and he would sing-speak-show with his people.</p><p>But they are not longer <em>his</em> people, anymore.</p><p>Tim slaps a hand against his chest, "You tell me of dangers, and yes, I am afraid. I do not take your warning lightly, blood-sister, favorite of the Twins. But when I think about turning back from this my heart tells me that it is just as wrong. The Ravens may tell you that disaster will fall upon my horns, but <em>Ymir</em> within me tells me that to turn back here is a worse fate."</p><p>Rose's eyes are sad, soft and a little wet when he looks up at her. He wonders how terrible the things she saw were. If he can avoid it, or if he will recognize this disaster when it strikes. Tim laughs, shaky and soft -</p><p>"Perhaps I have spent too long here, Rose. I do not think I was nearly this stubborn or ambitious when I was younger."</p><p>"No, you thick-headed fool." Rose sighs, "No, you were not."</p><p>Tim reaches for her, and she grasps his forearm, the frost of her skin making his southern-flesh raise with goose bumps.</p><p>"Blood-sister, whatever fate may befall me, will you stand with  me – until the end?"</p><p>"And beyond, blood-brother." Rose says, cupping the back of his neck and kissing his forehead. "Always, my-blood. Always."</p><p>-</p><p>The Lazarus pulls him under, and Tim falls below the surface of the burning water without a protest. He is too tired to protest – the weeks of inactivity and eating only slivers of food and drinking sips of milk have left him emaciated and a pathetic remnant of the warrior he once was. Tim sneers at himself, the part of himself that is capable of thought sneers, at least. The rest of him is in pain and <em>angry</em>.</p><p>It was that thing inside of him, Tim's mind screams at him, that thing inside of him. The water forces itself into his mouth until he has no choice but to let it in. To let it drown him.</p><p>The water is burning him, inside out, and there is nothing Tim can see but the bright <em>seithr</em> of the Lazarus flame, nothing Tim can <em>feel</em> but Lazarus' rage and might.</p><p>It pushes into him, burning his insides and churning in his lungs and stomach. He can feel it burning his skin away. It is a fight.</p><p>The sick-thing, <em>Ymir</em>, and Lazarus. A fight for Tim's body.</p><p>The sick-thing scream-howl-snarls, firmly holding onto him and sinking its sickly tendrils into his core. <em>Ymir</em> hardens and freezes inside of him, his own <em>seithr</em> ripping and tearing at the sick-thing, while Lazarus burns everything away.</p><p>In flashes Tim sees the flesh over his bones melting and rebuilding – melting away the southern guise, rebuilding as his true frost, then melting away again and again and again. The sick-thing is tenacious, and propagates just as fast as the frost cuts it off and the Lazarus destroys it.</p><p>He can feel the Lazarus closing around his brands, and Tim turns his attention to that.</p><p><em>No</em>, Tim thinks. <em>Those are mine</em>.</p><p>Tim won those brands. He <em>earned</em> them. He said no to Ra's once before, and he is saying no <em>now</em>.</p><p>Those brands are his prizes, the proof of his survival. Proof that he survived the Obeah man, the slaughter of his mother's stead, and the so-called justice of this imperfect land. It is proof, a physical reminder to all who see it that Tim is not, and never will be, the tame creature they wish to see.</p><p>It is a <em>reminder</em>. It should have served as his reminder.</p><p>The Lazarus roars in Tim's ears, but it does not sear away his scars.</p><p><em>Ymir</em> screams in his bones, and the sick-thing is slowly, but surely being eaten and beaten back.</p><p>Tim does not know how long he has been under the water. He does not know how long the Lazarus has been burning him.</p><p>But he knows that it is not yet over when he breaches the surface of the water, body jackknifing and curling into itself as his stomach <em>heaves</em>.</p><p>Tim vomits water, the bile stinging his raw throat – raw from screaming or from Lazarus or from the <em>seithr</em>, Tim does not know – and there is something making its way up. It should be impossible, for Tim has consumed next to nothing over these past few weeks. But there is something hard and hot and heavy forcing its way up his throat and spilling into his mouth.</p><p>His hands react on instinct, rising to catch whatever it is that is falling out of his mouth and onto his raw palms. Tim's vision is blurry and refuses to focus, but whatever it is – Tim does not remember ever putting something like it to his lips.</p><p>It is gray and round, like a river stone. And it is coated in a thick, sticky film of – of <em>bile</em> and slowly moving liquid. A membrane of some sort. Tim can see it moving, slowly and sluggishly moving, the membrane creating small little – little hooks that grasp at the air. This thing was latched to the inside of him.</p><p>Tim hisses, soundless and does not know what to do with it.</p><p>The Lazarus pushes him, pushing at his mind <em>drop it, drop it, burn it, devour it, destroy it</em> – And <em>Ymir</em> thunders through his bones, <em>make it hurt, hunt down its master, flay the skin from their bones, vendetta, vendetta, vendetta, blood repays blood - </em></p><p>Lightning cracks off his skin, burning his flesh and bursting through scabbing wounds – white and hot and beautiful. Familiar and comforting.</p><p>Tim's mind is a haze and he cannot <em>think</em>. Tim cannot put his thoughts into words but only into <em>seithr</em>. And the dragon's breath within him responds in kind. Tim snarls and heats the thing in his hands, watches as lightning explodes and bursts from his skin and burns the thing. Slowly. He watches it writhe and bubble and burst and evaporate and smoke and smolder until it is nothing.</p><p>Thunder and lightning crack overhead, and the steam and smoke of the Lazarus burns his raw flesh. But Tim does not have the strength to move.</p><p>He is too <em>angry</em> to move.</p><p>The world is a haze of magic and <em>seithr</em> and heat around him, and he can see no shapes or faces. It is all a rush of sensations that just makes Tim <em>angrier</em>.</p><p>Who was the one who did this, <em>why</em> did they do this, and how will Tim <em>break them</em> -</p><p>The Lazarus whispers, its flame retreating back into the water, into the earth, presumably back to its ancient chamber beneath the palace. And with it, it takes the last of its <em>seithr</em> – but it gives him a name.</p><p>Hate and anger rage through Tim like winter storms, and Tim watches as the <em>seithr</em> around him freezes as the Lazarus retreats. The world changes from a mass of reds and oranges to blues and violets. Out of the corner of Tim's eye, Tim sees the brilliant flare of <em>Ra's</em>. Ra's.</p><p>Tim turns, and it is not his bones or his flesh that turns him, but the sheer, raw anger of his <em>seithr</em> that makes him move. It is dangerous, a small part of Tim's brain whispers, it is dangerous to be so far deep into the <em>hammask</em>. To allow himself to be so far gone.</p><p>But Tim is angry. And he does not care.</p><p>Tim turns on his King, and cannot think of the other <em>seithr-shapes</em> that surround him. He can only focus on the jade-green-gold that makes him think of the Lazarus, and the name that echoes within his skull.</p><p>He turns onto his King and <em>howls</em>.</p>

</p><p>Tim is, at once, the most powerful he has ever been before and the weakest he has ever been. His power is out of control. <em>Ymir</em>'s rage is frigid within him, but it refuses to rise to the surface. The gift of dragon's-breath arcs and crackles along his skin, flaying the regenerating flesh off as fast as it returns. Water condenses in his hands and in between his fingers, small clouds that hiss and roar with electricity.</p><p>It storms through him, forcing him to stand and keeping him up. Tim's mind flashes back to the north, the laugh of the Obeah man, his mother's horns, his father's skin, blood on the snow. Tim screams and his heart rages.</p><p>Mac-<em>amme's</em> face flashes in the corner of his eye along with her <em>huldr-</em>kin, and Tim tastes ice and blood.</p><p>He screams and sorrow burns through his veins, even as everything he is curls and flexes around the name he has been given.</p><p>The Lazarus is just as angry as he is, and Tim wonders if this is why so few of Ra's' progeny have survived their trials by fire. It is <em>madness</em>. The Lazarus gives but it takes and takes and devours and is never satisfied. It is like <em>Ymir</em>, in that sense. But <em>Ymir</em> does not corrupt and destroy with pain, but with knowledge.</p><p>Tim bellows his rage as lightning cracks in the sky and thunder shakes his bones, and the world around him is a blizzard of color and <em>seithr</em>.</p><p>This is dangerous, Tim knows. Every frost-kin knows this.</p><p>They are children of <em>dragons</em>. They are the get of <em>Ymir</em>. They are gifted with the love of the land and with the ability to see and touch and feel as <em>Ymir's</em> favored ones. But they are vulnerable. Tim's rage is <em>Ymir's</em> rage is the Earth's rage. All <em>seithr</em> is one, and he is them and they are him. Tim has been <em>wronged</em>, he has been <em>violated</em>, he has been <em>broken</em>.</p><p>This will not stand.</p><p>The Earth pushes him and <em>Ymir</em> guides him as Tim walks towards shore, towards the jade-green that is Ra's, and the other <em>seithr</em>-shapes, Tim knows them. He knows them but he is so <em>angry</em>. There is much to do and he has no time – no time – no patience, no thought -</p><p><em>Seithr-</em>shapes that taste like kin draw closer and it is nothing but a thought, a flicker of the beginning of a feeling that makes him freeze them in place. His skin burns, his body is burning, and he does not think he will ever truly be free of the Lazarus flame's rage, but <em>Ymir's</em> hate is comforting once more.</p><p>How could Tim forget the frost in his veins and the thunder in his bones? How could Tim have ever forgotten the soft, clear, crisp <em>seithr</em> gifted to him by his<em> huldr-</em>kin in spirit-dreams? How could Tim have forgotten the heart-beat of his mother-dragon, his ruby-scale, pulsing just behind his own? How could Tim have ever forgotten the smell-taste-feel-sight of <em>seithr</em> and the many, many colors the world takes on?</p><p>The Lazarus' voice is a poisonous whisper that makes Tim's vision white.</p><p>Tim snarls as he lunges forward, energy seeping from him as Ra's' <em>seithr</em> and magic flares up to contain his winter in a large, glimmering shield -</p><p>"You." Tim snarls, and it takes so much effort to find words the man can understand. But he <em>must</em> understand them because Tim has things to do and he has no patience for Ra's to be floundering blind in the wake of the vendetta he will unleash. "<em>You</em>."</p><p>Ra's speaks, others-speak, but Tim focuses on clearing his vision enough to see the sharp lines of Ra's' face and the color of his skin -</p><p>"You incompetent, blind, arrogant, <em>ass</em>." Tim snarls, reaching back and punching Ra's as hard as he can, one hand fisted in the man's robes, ignoring the burning sensation of Ra's' shield. Tim focuses all the magic he has left into breaking it, into holding on – "You never told me your daughter was an insane, murderous, blood-thirsty, <em>bitch</em>."</p><p>Ra's' shield drains the last of his magic, and as the world washes out into whites and blues and greens and reds and yellows, Tim spits blood and closes his eyes. He feels himself falling, and arms catching him, and a cacophony of noises slowly fading away.</p><p>The last thing Tim makes sure he sees is Ra's' look of complete shock.</p><p>Tim smiles.</p><p>The world is black.</p><p>-</p><p>There are many words Tim has learned from various languages living in the palace and interacting with the royal family and other foreign-born soldiers. Many of them are hard for him to understand because there is no equivalent in his own tongue. But there are many he is growing to appreciate.</p><p>"You <em>jest</em>." Tim says, eyes wide as Owens shakes his head, "You must have gotten your head bounced off the floor more times than I remember from when you and Jason last sparred. We should take you to the healer's – "</p><p>Owens bats Tim's hands away, "I am not joking with you. Why would I joke with you? Mercer spat at the Princess' feet and called her <em>quim</em> to her <em>face</em>."</p><p>"What part of the Princess' reputation as the woman who launched a thousand wars does he not understand?" Tim whispers, feeling a little faint. The Princess is intimidating at the best of times, downright terrifying at the worst. He has only talked to her twice, and both times were short yes and no conversations that lasted only a few moments, each. She could give any <em>jarl</em> in the north a run for their money. (That is one of the phrases Tim has learned here, and he is rather fond of using it.)</p><p>"Yeah, well." Owens shifts uncomfortably, "I do not know if this is true, an perhaps you can verify it with Jason or Cassandra – " Owens leans forward to whisper in Tim's ear, "I heard that he suggested the things she could do with her sharp tongue before leaving. And the King told her she had to wait until he was out of the Imperial City."</p><p>"Fuck." Tim whispers.</p><p>(If it does not happen within the walls of the Imperial City, it cannot be said that the King gave direct sanction for it. And knowing the Princess, she will strike the moment Mercer's feet leave the city's boundaries. From the city's outer walls there is nothing but jungle for leagues. No one will ever find the body.)</p><p>"Yeah." Owens says. "<em>Fuck</em>."</p><p>-</p><p>"Rest. You are greatly weakened, from the poison and the fever, and now because of this." Rose says, pushing Tim back down, "There will be time for vendetta later. We must focus on putting flesh on you again. You are nothing but bone and skin."</p><p>"I will replenish myself with her <em>blood</em>." Tim snaps, angry at himself when he cannot rise again. He is so <em>weak</em>. <em>Ymir's</em> voice in him is disturbed, unsettled, and he is so restless. "My horns itch."</p><p>"I can tell." Rose says, smacking his hand away when he reaches up to scratch. She pulls out long strips of cloth to wrap them with, "You are like a child. Look at you pout, so. But – I am glad. This is the you I love and respect. It is much more preferable to the weak, passive, bag of bone from before."</p><p>Tim clicks his tongue, hissing as Slade tightens the bandages on his arm.</p><p>"You are a fool." Slade snaps, eye narrowed. "You are a fool, a thick-headed, stubborn <em>fool</em>. What were you thinking? Allowing yourself to get so lost in the <em>seithr</em> and your <em>hammrammr</em> that you lost control like that? Do you even know how badly your flesh has been cut? You are in no condition to be entering the <em>hammask</em>. Of all the <em>idiotic</em>- "</p><p>Rose and Tim flinch as Slade bursts into hand motions, racing through signs and sounds too fast for them to catch. Rose sighs, resting her hand on the side of his face.</p><p>For now, everyone else has been banned from this room except the three of them. Tim expects that he has probably done much damage to the courtyard, and he hopes that he did not kill anything.</p><p>"You scared us all." Rose says, "A page had come running – he said that you were having a fit. That you burst into flame."</p><p>"I am the north." Tim says, neck flushing with embarrassment as Slade raises a cup of water to his lips. Like he is an invalid. "You could not have thought I would truly burn."</p><p>Slade and Roses' expressions turn dark.</p><p>Tim flinches at their gaze.</p><p>"We thought you were at death's door." Rose says, "Roy and Bruce have been looking up – looking up whatever it was for weeks. We thought you were cursed."</p><p>"What was it?" Tim asks, "I did not – I was unable to truly see what it was at the time. The thing I spat up. It looked like a <em>geas</em>. But wrong."</p><p>"You spat what up?" Slade asks, concern and fear flickering over his features as he lowers the cup. "When?</p><p>"Did you not see that part?" Tim blinks, licking water from his lips, "I do not – time felt different in the fire. It was alive – like a small stone, but covered in some sort of – slime? It moved and it writhed in my hands."</p><p>"We were too far away – and we could not see past the storm of <em>seithr</em> and magic you had gathered." Slade says, stroking his chin, "We shall tell the others. Perhaps they are familiar with this sort of magic."</p><p>"What else happened?" Tim asks.</p><p>"You summoned lightning and thunder. It struck you repeatedly." Rose says, "You froze the water around you, but the green flame kept melting it – and the air smelt of burning flesh and sulfur. There was a trail of blood through the</p><p>"The combined power of your frost and the flame were so loud we could not hear you. You were screaming, your mouth was open. You bled so much, blood-kin." Slade says, pinching the bridge of his nose. "If my hair were not already white, I swear to <em>Ymir</em> – "</p><p>"You destroyed so much." Rose says, "It was in chaos. Complete and utter chaos. We thought you would be consumed by it. I do not think I have ever felt <em>seithr</em> so angry. Or seen so much of it in one place, aside from <em>Ymir's</em> well."</p><p>Tim runs his tongue over his teeth, "I was angry. I <em>am</em> angry."</p><p>"And then you came at the <em>King</em>." Slade says, "You ripped through all the shields everyone threw up, the shields the King threw up, and you <em>punched him in the face</em>."</p><p>"And <em>fainted</em>."</p><p>"I did not <em>faint</em>. I lost consciousness." Tim protests. "And it was not <em>that</em> hard of a punch. He still has his head."</p><p>Rose's lips twitch upwards, "At least you are talking like yourself again. Small mercies, I suppose."</p><p>-</p><p>It takes Tim two days to track his wayward sister down, and when he finally does pin her down she's sitting on top of one of the wall's watchtowers dressed in the clothes of a washer-woman.</p><p>She gives him a look of amusement before returning to watching the sunset over the lush green canopy of the surrounding jungles. It is a beautiful sight, but Tim wishes that he could show her the rainbow cast by the sun's rise over the ice of his home. He thinks she would love that.</p><p>"You wanted to ask me something." Cassandra says, "And I am dressed as a washer woman because it's one of the few disguises I have not used yet, and the guards have not been told to watch out for."</p><p>"Ah." Tim nods, "Should you be telling <em>me</em> that, though? I am the Commander of the guard, now."</p><p>"I trust you not to abuse that power." Cass replies, smiling, "Or I'll kick your ass."</p><p>"Speaking of ass kickings – " Tim wonders how best to phrase this, and turns to face her fully. She raises an eyebrow and matches the movement. He crosses his legs, hands resting on his knees. "Could you defeat Shiva in a fight?"</p><p>Cassandra's lips turn downwards and she cracks her scarred knuckles, "Watch your words, Commander."</p><p>"It is because I must watch my words that I ask you directly." Tim breathes, "And it is because I am now the Commander that I must ask you this question."</p><p>Cassandra's eyes are hard and her mouth is a sharp line before she jerks her head downward. "I could perhaps fight Shiva to a draw in a duel."</p><p>"But in a fight – a full out fight, if I asked you to, could you take her down?" Tim presses on. Do you <em>trust</em> her?</p><p>"I think that if it were to come down to it, brother, I would need more than your word to make me face her." Cassandra shakes her head. "You are my brother, my blood. But it would take more than just your word to make me face her in what would most likely end in one of our deaths."</p><p>Tim knows that it is not because Shiva is her mother. Cassandra feels no true ties to the woman who bore her, and is more likely to refer to Selina as a mother than Shiva.</p><p>"I hope that day never comes." Tim says, standing – frowning at the stiffness of his new armor. "Thank you for your time, sister. I will not bother you about this any longer."</p><p>-</p><p>"What do you think of Damian?" Ra's asks him, seemingly out of nowhere. But Tim is used to his King's strange moods, and does not do much  more than twitch when the man speaks up for the first time in hours.</p><p>"He is a good addition to the royal family." Tim replies. He does not see Damian often, but he is fond of the boy. Or as fond as he can be. The boy is being raised to be the future lord of Gotham, and interim King of the empire. He will be a good fighter. A strong one.</p><p>"And? What do you think of his progress, his education?"</p><p>"The boy is barely ten." Tim replies, "I do not think I can say much on the topic."</p><p>"You have known him since he was born, my blade. I would have your council. Do not censor yourself in this, when there is no need." Ra's says, "You have never censored yourself before. Do not start now."</p><p>Tim bites the inside of his cheek, gripping his wrist behind his back -</p><p>"He is a biased, prideful, arrogant, twit. But he is not at fault for this and he is a good brother." Tim says. "And his tutors need to get their noses out of their books and take a look at the real world."</p><p>They feed him biased drivel and tell him that he is great and amazing and destined for great things. Damian is <em>destined</em> for nothing. No one is <em>destined</em> for anything except that which they work to take for their own with their blood and flesh and bone.</p><p>"I see." Ra's replies, setting down his quill. "I was concerned that would be the case. It was the same for you, was it not?"</p><p>"And every other soldier, scholar, and student in the capital." Tim replies. He…<em>corrected</em> many of his peers as he grew older. And the combined efforts of Cassandra, Jason, Dick, and his fellow foreign-born students got many of the more problematic tutors sacked. "It is the right of conquerors, I suppose."</p><p>"If Damian is to rule he should know his people." Ra's sighs, "I believe that we will have to do something about the education system sometime soon, my blade."</p><p>"Are you asking me to look into it? Do I <em>look</em> like one of your council members?" Tim raises an eyebrow. When the hell does the man think Tim's going to find the time to do it when he is attached to Ra's' side for every single moment of the day and night? Tim sighs. "But if my King demands it, I suppose it shall be done."</p><p>Ra's' lips twitch upwards and he resumes writing.</p><p>"It is for the good of our people, my blade. Do not pout so."</p><p>"I do not <em>pout</em>." Tim mutters, "And this could be easily resolved by just firing the tutors."</p><p>"You would need to train new ones to replace them." Ra's says, "And you would still need a new curriculum."</p><p>Tim clicks his tongue, glaring at the man's head.</p><p>"For the good of your little brother, Commander." Ra's reminds him. "So that he no longer remains a biased, prideful, arrogant twit."</p><p>"I am beginning to think that the prideful, arrogant, twit part was in the flesh to start with."</p><p>-</p><p>When Jason is fifteen he joins the guard-proper, passing his exams with flying colors, and is placed in a patrol group around the city. Tim does not want to say that he <em>frets</em>, exactly, but he is <em>worried</em>.</p><p>"I told all my contacts to try not to give you trouble." Tim says, rocking back on his heels as he watches Jason dress in his new uniform. With his promotion from trainee to actual soldier, Jason has moved into his own room. Of course, Jason could have rooms within the palace-proper as the ward of the First Consort. But Tim thinks that Jason feels just odd as he does whenever servants come up to help him, or whenever anyone looks at him with reverence. "Also if any of my contacts <em>do</em> give you trouble I will laugh because you are supposed to be part of the Imperial guard, how could you have trouble?"</p><p>"Go to sleep." Jason says, "You have time left before you need to be up for training."</p><p>"But I want to see you off." Tim says, "And wish you luck."</p><p>"As if I need it." Jason replies, flicking Tim's forehead, "Thanks, kid. I'll be fine. Nothing ever happens in the Imperial city."</p><p>Jason is mostly right.</p><p>-</p>

</p><p>As soon as Tim has his strength back and has seen that no one is dead or dying from his uncontrolled power, Tim orders the Consort's Garden closed.</p><p>"No one comes in the Garden or leaves it without my permission." Tim says, leaning heavily on Cassandra's arm, "I do not want anyone who is not one of our own coming or going. None of the royal family may enter. And by that I mean Ra's. <em>Especially Ra's</em>."</p><p>Jason raises an eyebrow, opens his mouth to speak and Tim cuts him off with a glare -</p><p>"I have things to do and I do not need interference." Tim winces, coughs, "I would kick the other consorts out, but that would hardly be fair to them. Close off my quarters. Only you two and myself will be allowed in. Call Roy and Dick here. I will speak to them of the nature of this – not-<em>geas</em>." Tim sighs. He turns to the his guards stationed by the door, "You heard me. Inform the others."</p><p>The black-armored sentries hold their fists over their chests and bow, "Yes, High Consort."</p><p>Tim waits until they are gone to turn to Jason – "While I was <em>subdued</em> what did I miss? Is the country falling about our ears as we speak?"</p><p>"Not quite." Jason says, moving to Tim's desk to unfurl maps and missives that are – an alarming pile that threaten to teeter and spill to the floor.</p><p>"That is not very reassuring." Tim says, grunting when he collapses onto his seat, "I meant that as exaggeration, Jason. You were supposed to say <em>of course not</em>."</p><p>"Yeah, well. Shit happens. A <em>lot of shit happens</em>. Especially when the King's blade, head of the whispers, and general leader and controller of various underground organizations stops responding to official business."</p><p>Cassandra reaches over Tim's shoulder to point at marks on the map, "The whisperers are frantic. People claiming to be Imperial guards or men of the King's Blade have been going through cities. They have been enforcing laws that definitely are not of our making, and have been assuming control of the city's people and supplies. The whisperers know better, of course – you would never be so bold or overt – but it is not as if they could <em>tell</em> anyone."</p><p>"In some cases these guards are <em>actual</em> Imperial guards." Jason says, "But in most cases it is doubtful. But they all have Imperial training. Or at least, enough of it to use the basic fighting forms. None of the ones claiming to be ours are actually ours, though." Jason taps the southern border, "It happened most rapidly in the southern outposts, near the Bone Yard. But it is also rapidly spreading from the East. Only the west and north have remained unaffected so far. But the whisperers are nervous and do not know what action to take."</p><p>"So are we safe on those borders, and does the King know about it?"</p><p>"It is slow and you know how long it takes for the King to learn anything without the aide of the whisperers and our network." Cassandra replies, "He does not know yet, but it is only a matter of time. And we are not quite <em>safe</em> on those borders either. Fever has taken them."</p><p>"<em>Fever</em>?" Tim says, "What <em>kind</em> of fever?"</p><p>"Sudden. Like poisoning. They vomit and vomit for days, though." Jason replies, "Most die. Those that survive – they are."</p><p>Cassandra and Jason exchange glances, Tim narrows his eyes.</p><p>"Placid." Tim answers for them, "They become <em>placid</em>." Like I did.</p><p>"Yes," Jason says, "When Slade and Rose were coming in from the North they said it was like watching people walk in their sleep. They were dazed, relaxed, they could trip and fall and would only laugh about it. No one was angry. No one ate. Food was rotting in their stalls and cattle went untended. But it was only a few cities at the time. It has been weeks."</p><p>"Slade and Rose have been coming and going since you first fell ill." Cassandra says, "Every time they return it seems like more villages have been struck. It is only villages thus far. And it does not seem to be spreading by air or by touch."</p><p>Tim clicks his tongue – "It is poison. But what, I do not know. And the fever – <em>agh</em>. Is there anything else?"</p><p>His siblings look at each other, Jason jerks his chin at Cassandra who makes an abortive move forward, as if she was going to punch him. Tim looks between them, dread slowly building up -</p><p>"Someone is going to have to tell me at some point."</p><p>"Nobles – " Cassandra starts -</p><p>"That aren't <em>ours</em>. Of course." Jason adds on.</p><p>"Nobles who haven't – ah. Who have <em>resisted</em> our reforms – " Cassandra says. "Well. They have called to have you removed from the al Ghul family register."</p><p>"They've <em>what</em>?"</p><p>"They have put it to vote to declare you unfit and reduce your title from High Consort to First Consort." Cassandra says. "You have not left the Consort's Gallery, and only a handful of people have seen your face recently. They believe that you are no longer fit. That your fever has left you addled. Or that perhaps you are shirking your duties and responsibilities as the King's Blade."</p><p>Tim blinks, "They <em>what</em>?"</p><p>Cassandra and Jason exchange glances, "Well. Uh. You know how normally they're all – <em>consorts should be quiet and weak and know their place?</em> And how they usually get on your case for being improper and leaving the Garden and generally making yourself a political and economic presence among the people?"</p><p>"<em>Yes</em>."</p><p>"It looks like they have reversed that stance." Jason says, "By a lot."</p><p>"To the point where they want me <em>off the throne</em>?" Tim hisses. "What – do they have someone else to take my place as High Consort?"</p><p>The two exchange another set of glances and wince when Tim exhales frost onto the table.</p><p>"Please tell me that my <em>husband</em> has not been so <em>stupid</em> as to actually <em>tolerate this</em>. Do they forget that I am the <em>King's Blade</em>? I cannot be <em>unseated unless I die</em>."</p><p>"Well. <em>About that</em>. Some people – and by people I mean nobles and merchants were are. Shall we say <em>pissed</em>?"</p><p>"I think <em>pissed</em> is an accurate term." Cassandra says. "Some <em>pissed</em> merchants and nobles are <em>upset</em> at the things you have done as the Commander and King's blade. They accuse you of treason to the throne, heresy, and among other things adultery."</p><p>Tim hears something crack.</p><p>"<em>Adultery</em>." Tim hisses, voice cracking, "Of all the stupid things to attack me with <em>adultery</em>. At what point in between my ascent to High Consort and <em>now</em> would I have had the <em>time</em> to find a lover of all things? It has been barely <em>three months</em>."</p><p>"You might not want to know. Some things are best left a vague mystery." Jason says.</p><p>"They accuse you of adultery with a rather long list of people. Jason at the top of that list. Myself somewhere towards the middle. Bruce, Selina, Dick, Z, Prudence, and…various others among other names as well." Cassandra says. "The more stressing accusation is that of treason because those are almost correct."</p><p>"They finally caught on to who has been controlling and regulating black market trade across the country and through most of the illegal channels for the past six or so years. They do not have evidence, but rumor is enough at this stage." Jason says. "At the rate they are digging to find things to throw against you, they may even find you guilty for murder. Again."</p><p>"I have not personally killed anyone in <em>ages</em>." Tim mutters. "Are they going to blame me for the slums?"</p><p>"They <em>want</em> to. But they have no proof that <em>Robin</em> is you. Thankfully they are idiots and are too daft to use the obvious." Cassandra says, "What would you have us do, brother?"</p><p>"Well. For one thing," Tim says, rubbing his temples, "I would have you help me get dressed so that I may put in an appearance around the city. I want to go to the lower districts. We have time before noon, yes? We will go to the market and buy fruit. And cloth. Let them see my face, and we shall put an end to the rumors among the people. The people are our first priority. If we have them behind us, as we always have, the rest shall fall into place."</p><p>"Keep the Garden closed in the mean time?"</p><p>"Locked down. Cassandra, follow us with a five minutes grace from the rooftops. Jason will be on the ground with me. Let us see how many spies they have brought into our city."</p><p>-</p><p>"What that?" Tim points to a strange, small creature covered in fur. Tim pulls on Jason's tunic, fingers curling into the soft fabric as he points at the thing. It has four, short legs, and eerie green eyes. It is <em>beautiful</em> and Tim wonders if it is some sort of familiar-being or a guardian. Jason turns, blinks, looks around.</p><p>"What is what?"</p><p>"That!" Tim points again, "<em>Oh!"</em> Tim gasps as it looks at him before darting away. "It gone."</p><p>"It <em>is</em> gone." Jason corrects him, laughing and taking Tim's hand in his. It is odd, that Jason holds his hand, but Tim is starting to not mind so much. Though he does feel a little nervous that his hand is too sweaty. Jason's hands are much larger than his and have callouses. He wonders if his hands will be as big as Jason's some day. Neither his dam nor sire were very large. "And it is a cat. Do you not know what a cat is?"</p><p>"Cat." Tim repeats, rolling and tasting the word on his tongue. "A <em>cat</em>. Strong? Is cat strong? Magic? Talk? Speak? Tongue? Eat! What eat? Good eat? Eat good? Cat fast! Is cat strong? Cat gold always? The cat eye green! Green, Jason! Green! Wow!"</p><p>Jason smiles at him, and Tim blinks, points at Jason's eyes, "Like Jason's! Green!"</p><p>"Do they not have them in the north? What catches mice, then?"</p><p>"Mice?" Tim blinks, frowns. Jason releases his hands to make a small circle with his fingers.</p><p>"Like this. With a long tail. They get into your kitchen and eat things. Cats and foxes and hawks eat them. They make squeaking sounds? Ah! They have long whiskers and their nails click on the stone at night, when everything is quiet. They are brown or black and sometimes they are white. But usually they are brown or black."</p><p>"Mice." Tim repeats, twisting his lips, bites his cheek before tilting his head. "Rats?"</p><p>"Uh. Smaller."</p><p>"Cat eat mice?"</p><p>"Cat<em>s</em> eat mice." Jason corrects.</p><p>"There is <em>more than one cat</em>?" Tim gasps, eyes widening as he turns back to where the cat was. "All have eyes green?"</p><p>"No." Jason shakes his head, taking Tim's hand again and pulling him through the halls. "Some are yellow. Some are blue. Some are brown. And cats come in all sorts of colors – oh! I know. One of the consorts loves cats. I will introduce you to her."</p><p>"Consort? What consort?" Tim blinks, excitement building at the thought of possibly seeing more of these cats. They look like they would be nice to touch. He wonders what their <em>seithr</em> look-tastes like. The thought is followed by a soft pang of regret – he has been sealed and can no longer see-taste-touch-feel-smell <em>seithr</em> and magic. The thought is cut off from growing when Jason laughs and bursts out into a run, yanking Tim along behind him -</p><p>"<em>Ah</em> – I think I shall have to have her explain that to you, too."</p><p>-</p><p>"My hips do what?" Tim asks, turns to glare at Dick who is lying on some pillows in the shade. Dick covers his mouth, eyes crinkling shut in laughter, waving Tim off with the other hand. "Stop laughing at me. This is <em>peculiar</em>. This was not part of my training and I did not sign up for this."</p><p>"You are to be the High Consort. You signed up for <em>everything</em>." Selina points out, "Nothing is off the table, as it were."</p><p>"Are you sure about that?" Tim sighs, when Selina just raises an eyebrow. He gets back into starting position. "I do not think I was meant to be a dancer, can it not just be assumed that I competent if Ra's chose me?"</p><p>"One, it is tradition. Two, consorts are not traditionally former soldiers and barbarians of the north and learn this as children. Three, are you telling me you are giving up, Tim? Highly unlike you."</p><p>Tim makes a face, turns around to glare again when Dick starts laughing.</p><p>"Do not mind him." Selina says, "Once more, from the beginning. The lotus cradles the heart." She says, nudging his limbs into place before stepping back. "The lotus cradles the heart, then what?"</p><p>"Then the heart blooms into the sky." Tim says, and he thinks that this could be something like fighting or swordsmanship. Perhaps even the weave-chant-song of his people, if <em>there were not so many damned scarves</em>. Tim gets as far as <em>the birds of paradise bless the sun</em> before he feels one of the scarves start to tangle with his feet and he falls backwards – "<em>Ow</em>."</p><p>Dick bursts out into new peals of laughter, and Tim hears him yelp when Selina tosses a pebble at his head.</p><p>"This is <em>hard</em>." Tim whines, staring at the blue sky, "I can sword dance. Can I do that instead?"</p><p>"Sword dancing is for <em>one</em>. This is for <em>two</em>." Selina says, "You are making this harder than it is, little one."</p><p>"I am not little." Tim sits up and reaches down to untangle the multitude of scarves from his legs, "And why is Dick even <em>here</em>?"</p><p>"Because I miss you and we do not spend nearly enough time together." Dick replies, "And this is the only free time you have. I am not about to go following after you as you go about scaring people into doing your bidding. This is not a face meant for intimidation, little brother. And Selina is right, it is not nearly as hard as you are making it seem, would you like me to help you?"</p><p>"Yes." Tim sighs, shoulders dropping as Dick rolls to his feet with all the grace of the performer he is. Dick finishes untangling the scarves and effortlessly lifts Tim up. "You were born doing this, we do not dance in the north."</p><p>"Everyone dances, Tim." Dick says, "You dance when you fight, you dance when you dodge Jason's fists. You dance when you run and you dance when you are excited and without words. Everyone dances. You just do not think of it as dancing."</p><p>-</p><p>"There are rumors of – a how should I put this – an outlaw."  Z says as he leads the horse around the corral. Tim is still unused to this, but he has not fallen off so far today and that is a marked improvement from yesterday.</p><p>"Is that so?"</p><p>"Yes. He has been causing the city guard much trouble. Thus far he has killed one raider and set free dozens of slaves. Who have all mysteriously disappeared." Z says, glancing up at him, "And he has also done some…other things, as well."</p><p>"Really?"</p><p>"Scaring corrupt merchants. Targeting the rather violent and unsavory types that roam the streets."</p><p>"Sounds like he is doing the guards' work for them." Tim says, focusing on <em>not</em> slipping to the side and falling face-first into the dirt. "What else do they say about this strange person?"</p><p>"That he is an ally of the poor, a foreigner, and of <em>northern bearing</em>." Z says, "That he is soft spoken, educated, and extremely intelligent." Z's lips quirk up. "He sounds like you."</p><p>Tim clicks his tongue, "Now, Z, what about me is even close to soft spoken, educated, or intelligent? Our tutors absolutely despair at having me recite, you know that. The only thing that matches is that I am of the north. What an odd fellow, you would think that the guard would have found him by now."</p><p>Z hums, clicking his tongue and sending the horse into a slow trot, "Perhaps you are right. He does wear a red cloak after all. How hard could he be to find? And what sort of name is <em>Robin</em>?"</p><p>Tim wore the damn thing <em>once</em>. Once. Tim sighs.</p><p>"You are never going to let me live this down, are you?" Tim asks, narrowing his eyes at the back of the older boy's head.</p><p>"Live what down, bird-boy?"</p><p>-</p><p>They do not tell Tim about him. It stings – for he is Jason's blood, but he knows it is not the same here. Flesh is valued above blood. And while Jason is not flesh of any of the royal family, Jason is bought by wealth, in a sense. Someday, Tim thinks that he will <em>make</em> them understand that he is blood and that is higher than womb or flesh or money or anything else.</p><p>But for now, Tim waits in the barracks and hopes that <em>Ymir</em> is kind and does not take away Tim's only blood in this land of fire and sun.</p><p>Jason was not supposed to ever get hurt. He is too <em>strong</em> to get hurt. He is too good to be hurt. But he was and it happened so far away. So far away from where Tim can reach him.</p><p>Tim has contacts and his power and reputation as Robin, the boy wonder, stretch far and wide across the empire. But that is only within the boundaries of the Immortal King's realm, and Jason was injured in Gotham.</p><p>Tim loves and hates this strange place he has never seen, that has both given and taken Jason away from him.</p><p>Gotham has her own dangers, and they often keep Bruce away from the Imperial city. Tim knows that these dangers often trouble the man, but he does not understand what they are, not really.</p><p>He did not care to ask, and he feels foolish, now. For not asking. At the time Tim had reasoned that Gotham would never hurt him. Her dangers were too far away and irrelevant to him, when he was already surrounded by so many unknown and unnamed pitfalls <em>here</em>. There had been no point in trying to learn what would not be of use to him.</p><p>Now, leagues and mountains and deserts away from his blood-brother, Tim feels incredibly foolish.</p><p>Slade would be shaking his head and father would be lecturing him.</p><p>Tim bites his cheek and <em>hopes</em>.</p><p>He whisper-chants to <em>Ymir</em>. And his magic is still bound, and as he is now, Tim cannot see or direct the <em>seithr</em> to send his will and messages. But he thinks that it does not matter if he cannot see. <em>Ymir</em> must hear him. <em>Ymir</em> must grant him this boon.</p><p>Tim has lost so much already. He cannot lose his brother, too.</p><p>(It is hard for Tim to say he <em>hates</em> things. Tim is capable of rage and pain. And Tim knows dislike and he knows the feeling of betrayal. But <em>hate</em> is harder. It is a strong word, a word of <em>passion</em>. A word that speaks of great wrongs, of great injustices.</p><p>Tim did not <em>hate</em> the Obeah man and his raiders. There had been no time for <em>hate</em> to settle in. There was fear, then there was rage, and then there was satisfaction. Hiding. Fighting. Victory.</p><p>Tim did not hate the raiders who brought him here and branded him. He loathed them, yes. But he did not hate them. Hate is for equals.</p><p>But Tim <em>hates</em> the Joker.)</p><p>-</p>

</p><p>"Only this once," Dick tells them as he hands Jason the pipe, "And it is children's smoke. I will not have either of you becoming addicts just because you want to feel <em>grown up</em>."</p><p>"If you do not like smoke so much why do you have a set to start with?" Jason asks. Dick rolls his eyes -</p><p>"Because I am expected to entertain, little brother." Dick cuffs Jason over the back of the head when Jason tries to sneak more powder into the pipe's bowl. "This is why I said yes to you. Because if I said <em>no</em>, you would have gone off somewhere and gotten someone else to say yes and you would end up missing your shoes and pants and without a single coin to bring you home."</p><p>"I would <em>not</em>."</p><p>"Tim agrees with me."</p><p>Tim has nothing to say on the matter, he is just here because he wants to try this curious flavored-smoke, too. Tim is not exactly sure what can be pleasurable about inhaling smoke, but the colors are very pretty and he wants to find out how this contraption of glass and metal works.</p><p>"No, I'm Tim's favorite. He agrees with <em>me</em>." Jason protests.</p><p>"He only says that because he is stuck with you daily. He has to make his life tolerable somehow." Dick says, eyes crinkling at the corners in a way Tim associates with laughter simmering to the surface. "Go on. Try the smoke. And <em>do not</em> tell Bruce or Selina I was the one who let you try. I do not look forward to the lecture that would get me from either of them, or from Alfred back in Gotham."</p><p>Tim has heard many stories from the others about Alfred. He is something like the Ubu to the King, or perhaps the Blade to the members of the royal family. But <em>better</em>. Tim shivers. He does not think he will ever meet the man, but from the stories he has been told the weight of the man's word and disapproval makes him want to sit up straight.</p><p>He thinks that Alfred would have gotten along <em>wonderfully</em> with Mac-<em>amme</em>. He has been trying to see if Alfred was one of the <em>hulgr-</em>folke, but Jason has no idea what those are and assures him that Alfred is human.</p><p>Jason breathes in the smoke – purple and gray in color, like the dusk – and breathes out the plume in a perfect circle.</p><p>"Woah." Jason says, blinking, turning to Tim. "It tastes a little like the sugared drinks on feast-days. But warm and a little bitter."</p><p>Tim tilts his head, takes the pipe in his own hands – the shape is unfamiliar and he holds it clumsily until Dick corrects him with gentle fingers.</p><p>"Just breathe, slowly." Dick says, and Tim looks between his brothers and the pipe before raising it to his lips.</p><p>It is hot, is what Tim first thinks. And it makes him think of home – like cider. The warm cider on name-days and gift-days. It tastes too sweet and it makes Tim cough – but it makes him think of home.</p><p>"It is good." Tim says, coughing, "It tastes like cider. But sweeter and – duller. I suppose."</p><p>Tim's eyes water a little as he coughs, Jason claps him on the back between his shoulders.</p><p>"Can we try another flavor?"</p><p>"What? <em>No</em>." Dick reaches over to smack Jason over the back of the head, then cups Tim's shoulder. "You alright, little brother?"</p><p>Tim waves a hand in front of his face, coughing, "Yes."</p><p>It tasted like home.</p><p>(Tim wonders if Dick would let him have another taste when he is older. And if he did not bring Jason with him.)</p><p>-</p><p>"You will be recognized on <em>sight</em>. This is not going to be helping your case." Jason says, as Tim throws his signature red cloak over his shoulders.</p><p>"I am not shifting back any time soon." Tim replies. The skin around his horns is sore and sensitive, and his eyes blur every time he tries to block out his vision until it is only light and shape. The frost in him has yet to settle. And to be honest – Tim is frightened of returning to his southern skin. He is frightened of what will happen to him, of what has happened to him. He is not yet ready to give up the comfort of the weight of his horns or the taste-sight-smell of <em>seithr</em> on his tongue. "Besides, I need to reassure my people."</p><p>Jason sighs, pulling down his face mask, "I know. I know. But you are weakened and you have a list of charges against you. I do not want to give them more ammunition."</p><p>"Our people are loyal to us. We have to return that, Jason." Tim did not think he would ever become a <em>jarl</em>. Not even if he stayed in the North. But Tim knows what being a <em>jarl</em> means, and that is <em>protecting</em> and <em>serving</em> the people who have placed their lives in your hands. "I do not tolerate raiders in my city."</p><p>He understands that he cannot eradicate the existence of raiders. They will crop up, always. But Tim does not have to allow them in his <em>city</em>. Tim's lip curls as he pulls his hood up.</p><p>"I know. I am sorry I was not able to keep things under control while you were – unwell."</p><p>"It is not your fault. You had more things on your mind than just controlling the black market." Tim replies. "Let us go. My people have seen me in the day. They must see me in the night, as well."</p><p>-</p><p>The palace is empty of everyone Tim calls his own. They have all fled to Gotham to see after Jason. Bruce and Selina, even Talia have left, taking baby Damian with them. Cassandra and Dick following close after on their heels.</p><p>Tim is alone and there is no one to ask about what happened to Jason.</p><p>There are many rumors – that he was set aflame. That he was burned alive. That he was poisoned.</p><p>Tim whispers to the spirit of <em>Ymir</em> that is in all frost-children – He asks for <em>Ymir</em> to bring Jason home to him. He asks for <em>Ymir</em> to protect Jason. <em>Ymir</em> must do so – for Tim has been born in the summer, at high noon. But he was born <em>Ymir-blessed</em> and <em>hulgr-touched</em>. He was born with the latent gift of <em>hammrammr</em> from the mother-dragon and sister-<em>hulgr</em>.</p><p>He was born under a lucky sign.</p><p>(Children born in during the summer, during the day are supposed to be weaker than their kin. But Tim is <em>blessed</em>. He is <em>loved</em>.)</p><p>Jason does not know the ways of the frost and thunder, he was born in the West and half his flesh belongs to the spirits of the Western lands. But Jason is also half frost, half of <em>Ymir</em>.</p><p>Tim whispers to <em>Ymir</em> and on his name-day he asks only this boon of <em>Ymir</em>.</p><p>He thinks that this is the first time he truly understands that he is never going home. For all of his name-days prior, Tim has asked for freedom and escape and the power to return to who he once was. But this year, Tim asks for Jason to return.</p><p>The thirteenth name-day is an important one. <em>Ymir</em>'s number is thirteen – for thirteen dragons came out of <em>Ymir's</em> heart (and it was the thirteenth that became the father-mother of the first frost-born).</p><p>It is on the thirteenth name-day that children are sent for their first ceremonial rights, and it is on the thirteenth name-day that children leave the stead to find their mother-and-father-kin on their land. It is on the thirteenth name-day that <em>Ymir</em> sends all children their visions.</p><p>Tim clasps his hands together in the sign of the waking dragon, and holds his hands to his lips. He whispers for Jason to live, for Jason to return to his side.</p><p>The frost and thunder in him listens. And <em>Ymir</em> answers.</p><p>Jason comes home that winter under heavy curtains of rainfall that almost drown the streets.</p><p>-</p><p>"Do not even <em>think</em> about it." Tim snaps, trying to lock his thighs around Ra's' torso as the man pulls away – "What – <em>where are you going</em>- "</p><p>"Important matters of state are calling." Ra's replies, reaching to the side to drag one of the sheets around his waist, "Or do you not hear the page at the door?"</p><p>"I <em>hear</em> him. And I reckon that he can hear that we are <em>occupied</em>." Tim gapes, sitting up on his elbows as Ra's secures the sheet and walks towards their door – "Are you <em>serious? Do you expect me to just finish this by myself? </em>If I had known that becoming your consort would involve you repeatedly leaving in the middle of our joinings I would <em>have never said yes</em>."</p><p>"You are overly dramatic and for all you know this could be an emergency." Ra's replies – Tim groans, reaches over to grab a pillow and smothers a scream in it. If it <em>was</em> an emergency Jason or Cassandra or any one of his personal guards or spies would have come in through the window. The Ubu would have come in through the secret passages in droves and had them clothed and spelled and in the underground chambers by now. It is not an emergency and the man knows it. "Patience, my blade. It is a virtue that I think would look quite lovely on you."</p><p>"You are an <em>useless</em>, old, perverted, <em>goat</em>." Tim snaps, folding his arms and glaring at the ceiling. "Who starts things he does not finish and – "</p><p>Underneath his general ranting, in which he has broken off into his native tongue for a nicer variety of insults, Tim hears the page stammering from the doorway about a council meeting in ten minutes, and Ra's' assurances that Tim's ire is not directed at the page directly, and that he will be there shortly.</p><p>Tim hisses, glaring at Ra's' back as he closes the door again. "You are going to leave me like <em>this</em>," Tim gestures to his bare body, "After bothering me for almost an hour and dragging me away from <em>my</em> work to attend an assinine meeting that you can delegate to Z?"</p><p>"I never said that I was not going to finish." Ra's replies, dropping the sheet, "He said I had ten minutes."</p><p>"If you expect to rush through this I will just take care of this problem myself." Tim says, reaching up to twine his fingers through Ra's' hair as the man covers him again.</p><p>"I have ten minutes." Ra's repeats, raising an eyebrow, "We can finish in nine. And I never said I was going to rush. In all things, consort, you must be <em>thorough</em>."</p><p>"You would be late." Tim replies. "If you are to be as thorough as you would need to be to perform satisfactorily."</p><p>"A King is <em>never</em> late." Ra's says, "And if I have said it once, I have said it a hundred times, most beloved one. How can I possibly suitably rule a country, if I cannot attend to my own consort's needs? And when have I not satisfied you?"</p><p>Tim will only be capable of glaring for all of five seconds before he has to resort to hair pulling and biting to get his point across. And Ra's <em>knows it</em>.</p><p>"You are a smug <em>ass and I do not even know why I bother with you.</em>"</p><p>-</p><p>"Didn't the king give you work to study?" Jason asks when Tim flops face-forward onto the pile of pillows and blankets that make up Jason's bed. Cassandra and Jason have taken to sharing quarters now that they are both members of his elite guard and his coterie. Mostly for efficiency as whenever Jason goes to sleep or takes a break, Cassandra takes over for him. Tim squirms into the nest, sighing in contentment as he is fairly buried alive in bedding.</p><p>"You can teach me later." Tim replies, he is in need of a good nap. He had been up all night working on improving the code the whispers use. He is fairly sure that Ubu – the Ubu who was Ra's' son before taking on the name of Ubu – was fairly entertained by the limitations of the southerner's – and apparently western, eastern, and <em>everywhere but the north's</em> – lack of ability to see <em>seithr</em>.</p><p>"I am not your tutor." Jason says, Tim rolls in time to avoid Jason's weight landing on top of him. "Besides, it is actually <em>useful</em>."</p><p>"Your southern magic is backwards, wrong, and boring." Tim says. "It is also – "</p><p>"Inefficient. Yeah. But you don't have an equivalent for the spells he's trying to teach you in the north." Jason points out. "And you know he is just going to make you sit there and do them the entire time."</p><p>"I am the <em>High Consort</em>." Tim whines, "I thought the time for lectures is over. I thought my lessons were done."</p><p>"You married the <em>King</em>. The lectures <em>will never end</em>."</p><p>-</p><p>"Just a little." Tim needles, Z is the only one Tim can ask. Selina likes his hair as it is because she can play with it. Cassandra is not in the country, and Jason is more than likely to ruin it just for fun. Prudence would laugh at him and taunt him for ages before doing it, then she would taunt him some more and extract promises and favors from him mid-way through. Tim trusts Owens with nothing except the fact that the man is always at the wrong place at the right time. Tim does not trust Dick's concentration, and Bruce is a disaster when it comes to anything aesthetically relevant. "It is too long."</p><p>Ever since stepping down as the Commander of the King's armies, Tim has been growing his hair out. His hair has never been very long, but he is used to having it at a military shortness that all the pages keep it at. Even when he advanced in rank he kept it short. It is best for fights and easy to maintain. No fuss.</p><p>But it is <em>too long</em>, now. It curls around his ears and itches and bothers him terribly. It gets into his eyes and people – <em>Dick</em>, <em>Jason</em> – keep pulling at it to bother him or get his attention.</p><p>Tim does not mind it when Ra's runs his hands through it, or when Ra's pulls at it – but it is bothersome and it makes him look even more feminine than the numerous baubles and scarves he must now wear do. There is only so much of this Tim is willing to tolerate.</p><p>He was a <em>soldier</em> for <em>Ymir's</em> sake. It should not be so easy for people to forget that, but apparently a few months' worth of new hair combined with some pretty silks can do that.</p><p>"I do not think that I should be doing this." Z replies, "High Consort, I have to speak with – "</p><p>"I know who you have to speak with. I am the High Consort. I know <em>everything</em>. And I was your predecessor, I know your schedule. You do not have a meeting until two hours from now. That is <em>plenty</em> of time to trim my hair." Tim whines, "<em>Please</em>."</p><p>"The King likes your hair as it is." Z says, "As does the Second Consort of the Princess. And the wards of the First Consort. And – "</p><p>Tim groans, "They <em>got  to you</em>."</p><p>Z smiles, "It does not look so bad."</p><p>"It is <em>annoying</em> and I would take sheers to it myself if I trusted my ability." Tim mutters, putting his face into his hands. "You traitor."</p><p>"I apologize, High Consort. But a happy King is a King who is not breathing down my neck for faster results and making courtiers want to soil themselves." Z says, not sounding sorry at all. "And if it makes you feel any better, the less soiled garments at meetings means better results."</p><p>-</p><p>"You southerners and your <em>gods</em>." Tim sighs, sprawling his upper body over Ra's' desk as he watches the man read through plans for the upcoming festival for rain. "You have so many of them and they are all so <em>finicky</em>."</p><p>"They are gods, beloved one. It is their right to be." Ra's replies, neatly crossing out plans for a parade and writing <em>if it is raining the streets will not be suitable for such walking, keep in mind that it is a rain. festival. Rain. As in everything will be wet.</em> Tim really questions the intelligence of Ra's' court at times like these. "Surely even you barbarians understand what that means."</p><p>"You would be surprised." Tim laughs, "Do you not know what we did to our god?"</p><p>There are spirits in all places, and guardians, and there are primeval ones. But in the north there is only <em>one</em> god. Or at least – there <em>was</em> only one god.</p><p>"No. What did you do?" Ra's says, and Tim reaches over to tilt Ra's' head to meet his. "I thought the north was a godless land, as it were."</p><p>"Well. It is <em>now</em>." Tim makes the sign for the <em>Blood Titan</em> with one hand before laughing. "The bards tell us that it was not always so, though."</p><p>(It is from the Blood Titan's flesh that <em>Ymir</em> was born and scattered. His spine becoming the mountains of the land, his eye the moon in the sky, his belly the great chasm known as <em>Ymir's </em>well. And from his spine came the first thirteen. From the Blood Titan came <em>Ymir</em> and <em>Boer</em>. <em>Frejya</em> and <em>Freihr</em>. Who fought and fought and fought until <em>Ymir</em>'s body was torn to pieces and <em>Boer</em> collapsed into the sea. <em>Frejha</em> and <em>Freihr</em> became the brother-sister-king-queen over the waste of the war. And <em>Ymir's</em> first thirteen set fire to <em>Frejya</em> and <em>Freihr</em> in revenge for their father-mother.)</p><p>"And what did you do, beloved blade, to make it that way?"</p><p>"We burn our gods, husband. And we kill our kings."</p>

</p><p>"My son is – <em>touched</em>." Talia says, sitting before him. It is unusual, and it makes Tim incredibly uncomfortable. Talia has never been – <em>nice</em>. The woman is stern and distant. Regal in ways that Tim has not exactly seen Ra's in since he was a child and a regular soldier. "He sets fires. It is – it is considered to be unlucky."</p><p>Tim has heard of this from Z and Dick. Children who are born and set fires, bring rain, cause the earth the shake, make plants dry up or make them grow. Children who have not yet learned the ways of magic or control. They are rare, and they are <em>powerful</em>. But they are uncontrollable and cause disasters. They are outcasts, they are killed.</p><p>Personally, Tim thinks it is ridiculous and barbaric. But he holds his tongue.</p><p>For the crown prince, the first boy born to the line of the al Ghul's in years to be one of these children is truly tragic, indeed.</p><p>"Yes, Princess." Tim says, dipping his head, "I – am sorry for such misfortune to fall on him."</p><p>He is not sure why the Princess has called him to her private rooms. Or why she is being so – open with personal information with him. It is not because he is the Commander-to-be. Someone else could always gain that favor over him, and Talia has never been one to show her favor for anyone, or to hold one above the rest.</p><p>"Yes." Talia's hands curl into fists, "I have delayed in telling my father. But it is inevitable that he will find out. The fires grow by the day. I fear he will hurt himself."</p><p>Tim mentally rolls his eyes. A fire-starter who hurts himself with his own <em>flame</em>. How ridiculous.</p><p>"But I have – Jason and Dick have told me stories. Rumors. Myths." Talia's eyes meet his, "My beloved First Consort has told me similar ones. I would have you tell me if they are true or not. If they are merely feeble attempts at pacifying my mind."</p><p>"As the Princess wishes it." Tim says. "What sort of rumors do you wish me to confirm?"</p><p>"That in the north none of your magic is done with words. That your kind bend the elements to your will, that you are <em>one</em> with the ice and frost of your wasteland." Talia says, eyes flashing as she leans forward. Tim bites back the words that spring to his mind – <em>my home is not a wasteland, and nothing is bent to our will, it is foolish to think you could bend the world to your whim</em>- "That all your babes are masters of magic before they can walk."</p><p>He twists his fingers into the hem of his tunic. "Well. You are not <em>wrong</em>."</p><p>Talia's hands clench and Tim is quick to add on – "But you are not <em>right</em>, either. Princess."</p><p>"Explain it to me. Tell me." Talia demands, and <em>this</em> is more like the Talia Tim knows.</p><p>Tim calls to mind Talia's lessons to him in Southern magic, of which there were only a handful. Tim thought she would understand – he <em>thought</em> she <em>did</em> understand.</p><p>"You once called my magic <em>wild</em>." Tim says, "I had thought you understood at that point."</p><p>Talia's eyebrows dip in confusion and Tim holds up a hand.</p><p>"I think we have misunderstood each other, once more, Princess. I cannot show you, bound as I am, but I will try to explain it in your tongue. As limited as your language is." Tim closes his eyes and tries to remember – "That which you call magic can be divided into two things. <em>Seithr</em> – soul, intent, emotion, desire – and <em>energy</em> – power, nature, and potential. You cannot have one without the other, and both are innate in all things."</p><p>Tim dips a finger into his tea and draws a circle on the table.</p><p>"This is the world. The world is the source of all energy. And it is from the world that we gain energy. We use that energy and it returns to the world. It is a constant and perfect cycle. <em>Seithr</em> is different. It is innate in all things – in me, in you, in the stone beneath our feet, in this cup of tea."</p><p>"Soul, you say." Talia asks, frown crossing her features, "To you, all things have a soul?"</p><p>"It is not <em>a</em> soul. It is – " Tim tries not to be impatient. It is not fair to her, "You cannot <em>see</em> as I used to. As I could if I were in my own skin, Princess. For us it is not a <em>thought</em> or a <em>belief</em>. It is fact. <em>Seithr</em>, like energy and heat, for us of the frost-born, is visible. It is – it is tangible. You can taste it in the air, you can feel it as you move, you can see it, and you can smell it with every breath. It is not something we are taught, it is something we know. We do not speak of it, as we do not speak of why we breathe or why we eat. It is part of us. It is <em>truth</em>. For is this cup not made of glass? And from where is glass from? It is made of sand, which is of the Earth. And what else has made this cup? Heat. Flame. And where has that flame started? From flint casting sparks upon wood or coal. And you can follow this chain forever and ever back until you return to the Earth."</p><p>Tim looks at his hands, and imagines his <em>seithr</em>.</p><p>"<em>Seithr</em> is the soul. It is the spirit in all things. It is alive, it is part of you. That which you call wordless magic – to us we do not know it. For no magic in the north needs words. It just needs <em>seithr</em>. If you will something to happen, all that you must do is move the <em>seithr</em>." Tim waves his hand over the tea on the table, imagining the flow of <em>seithr</em>, and gathering the tea into a small sphere. "In some cases you do not even need to see. It is easy to remember. To feel that innate knowledge. You do not need to consult a trainer or a scroll every time you draw your blade, and you do not need to check a recipe every time you brew a cup of tea."</p><p>"But <em>how</em> does it work?" Talia presses. "Can this work for Damian? Can Damian learn to control his power? Could you teach him?"</p><p>It is like trying to explain color to a blind man, Tim thinks, or the sky to a worm, or the bottom of the ocean to a bird.</p><p>"I do not know." Tim replies. "I do not know, because your people do not posses the ability to sense <em>seithr</em>. I do not know if this is what Damian is doing. For I cannot see-taste-feel, and I would not guess blindly. But it is most likely that it is what he is doing. Perhaps his <em>seithr</em> is strong. Perhaps it is reacting poorly to the the <em>seithr</em> around him. I do not know, Princess. Truly, I do not, and I apologize for that."</p><p>-</p><p>On Tim's ninth name-day, Jason and Cassandra sneak sweets out of the kitchens and the royal quarters for him. They share them with Z, Owens, and Prudence, and spend the evening huddled up in one of the many hide-aways trainees use when hiding from their superiors.</p><p>On this day Tim would have gained another notch on his horns. But Tim no longer has his horns. But he has these people, and they all sit close and stare at the stars together.</p><p>Jason is a warm line at his side as they point out constellations and tell stories about them. Tim knows some of them, but not all of them. Owens' hand is warm on his skin when he tugs on Tim's wrist and points towards a cluster of three stars and tells him about the rabbit, the fox, and the wolf.</p><p>Prudence interrupts him, saying that those three are not the rabbit, the fox, and the wolf, but the stars of the three gray-sisters. The two bicker, until Z separates them, handing them each a sugary-sweet pastry and telling them that they are both wrong, because it is the eye of the spider.</p><p>Tim feels his eyes droop as they lie there on the sun-baked tiles of the barrack's roof. Their voices wash over him, and the stars are beautiful. The sky is not like this in the north. It infinite black of the night sky is somehow warmer. Kinder.</p><p>Or perhaps it is the people. Tim does not know.</p><p>Tim thinks about his name-days in his mothers stead. The honey cakes and the taste of syrup cooled on fresh snow. Smoked meat and the sips of mead they would allow him before sending him to bed with warm milk. The feeling of new notches on his horns, the new weight-feel of the decorative rings that Tim would wear but only for a little because they are for special occasions.</p><p>He does not have that, here. But this – what he does have. It is good.</p><p>Jason kisses Tim's forehead as they all climb down and go back into their cots. Cassandra kisses his cheek before she leaves to return to her quarters in the palace-proper.</p><p>"Happy name-day." Z says as they split up to head towards their respective barracks, dragging a half-asleep Owens behind him.</p><p>"We will be in your care for another year." Prudence says, punching his shoulder before darting in to touch her cheek to his.</p><p>Jason's hand curls around the back of Tim's neck, "I am glad you are with us, little brother."</p><p>-</p><p>Tim curls his fingers into Slade's cloak, pulling on it as the man walks into the snow. "Me too." Tim calls out, the <em>seithr</em> in between his hands turning pale pink. "Me <em>too</em>."</p><p>"It is too cold." Slade replies, stopping to look down at him. "And it is dangerous. Stay here. I will be out all day."</p><p>"I want to wait for Rose, too." Tim says, pulling at Slade's cloak as hard as he can. "I want to wait for her."</p><p>"Tim, leave him be." Father calls, and Tim whines when hands pick him up from behind. He curls his fingers into the soft fur of Slade's cloak. "Tim, let him go. You are too small – you would get in the way if Slade got in a fight."</p><p>"I can <em>hide</em>." Tim whines, squirming against Father's hold. "I am the best at hiding. Everyone says so. No one can ever find me unless they ask help from Mac-<em>amme</em>."</p><p>"This is true." Slade sighs, holding his arms out, "You are a stubborn boy. You take after your dam too much."</p><p>Father laughs, turns Tim around to face him – "Listen to Slade. Do not bother him. Do not cause him trouble, understand?"</p><p>"Yes." Tim says, releasing Slade's cloak as Father hands him over. "I will be good."</p><p>"You do not know the meaning of the word." Slade snorts, holding Tim against his body with one arm and signing his farewell to Father with the other. "Come, flesh-of-my-blood."</p><p>Tim curls his fingers into Slade's mantle and tucks his face into the soft fur as they make their way into the woods. Tim's horns itch, and Tim nuzzles his forehead against Slade's shoulder. He can hear the <em>huldr</em>-kin whispering to each other, and Tim wants to go say hello. But he is going to be a good boy and stay quiet.</p><p>He can feel-taste the heartbeats of rabbits in the snow, and the tingle of air parting over feathers in the sky.</p><p>Slade walks until they are at a clearing near the border of Mother's stead, facing <em>Ymir's</em> spine. Slade sits down on a rock, setting Tim down.</p><p>"Go play." Slade says, drawing his sword and pulling out his wet stone. "And do not get into a fight with anything larger than you."</p><p>Tim nods and goes off towards some trees to see if he can convince any of the <em>hulgr</em> to play.</p><p>Eventually Tim ends up trying to make snow fall from the branches, coaxing it with <em>seithr</em> until it slowly falls in little clumps. Tim laughs as he stands under it. It is like standing under fresh snowfall, and he catches the snow in his hands. Tim calls ice over his skin, and makes a little bowl to catch the snow in.</p><p>"Mind yourself, blood-son." Slade calls out.</p><p>"Yes, blood-father." Tim calls back, touching his fingers to the <em>hulgr</em>-tree. This <em>hulgr</em> is not any of Mac-<em>amme</em>'s kin that he knows of. But he is nice – his <em>seithr</em> is pale gold and sparkles, a soft, warm feeling like sun on Tim's face in the early morning - all the same and opens his bark to let Tim have a taste of his sap.</p><p>He knows he is not supposed to ask when Rose will come back. If she comes back. But it has been two months, and the season of heavy storms will start soon. The dragons have taken to hunting the forests and stalking the skies before they retreat to <em>Ymir's</em> spine. It will not be safe to wait for her in the open anymore. Tim wonders if Rose is one of the wanderers on the nights when <em>Ymir's</em> eye closes.</p><p>But he cannot imagine Rose <em>not</em> surviving. <em>Ymir</em> is not that cruel. Tim does not think.</p><p>"Stop that." Slade says, and Tim guiltily lowers his hand from where he was about to scratch at his horns. His blood-father is very impressive. He knows things without looking. "Come."</p><p>Tim returns to Slade's side, guilt dragging his every step – "I did not mean to. They just itch, blood-father."</p><p>Slade sighs, taking Tim's face into his hands and tilting his head up. He hums, "You have not scratched your skin open, at least. You must not scratch at them, blood-son. What would you do if you made them grow wrong? Such fine horns you are looking to have and you could ruin their growth like this."</p><p>"But they <em>itch</em>." Tim whines, "Did your itch when they grew?"</p><p>"Mine grew when I was younger than you." Slade replies, "I do not remember them itching. Rose's horns broke skin when she was but a babe, like most women frost-born do. She did not cry or whine as you do. Do they hurt?"</p><p>"No." Not anymore. When the bone first started to grow and pierce skin it did. But now that his horns have fully crested and are now just starting to curl back, it is just the skin that itches. With every new bit of growth and with every emergence of a new section of horn the skin at the base stretches and heals anew. It itches so fiercely that some nights Tim rubs his head against the stone of his walls, and some nights he calls ice to them.</p><p>Slade sighs, drawing linen from a pouch at his belt and starts wrapping Tim's horns. Slade's <em>seithr</em> is cold, like ice, against Tim's skin, and tastes like leather and dried apples on Tim's tongue. "What a trouble-some child you are."</p><p>Tim holds still as Slade binds the skin at the base of his horns – "I miss Rose."</p><p>"I know."</p><p>"She does them right." Tim says. Rose always binds his horns best. "I want her to bind my horns again. It looks nice when she does it."</p><p>"I know." Slade rests his hand on Tim's head. "I miss her, a well. But do not tell her I said that."</p><p>Tim smiles. Slade's lips twitch up before he nudges Tim back towards the trees. He stands, pulling his quiver over his shoulder and drawing his bow.</p><p>"I will catch us a rabbit, stay by the trees. See if that gift of yours cannot find us any berries."</p><p>-</p><p>Ra's' hands are warm over the seals on his wrists, "It is not permanent."</p><p>"I know." Tim replies.</p><p>"It is merely – "</p><p>"A concession." Tim says, "That I have not taken over the throne. I am used to it."</p><p>"You should not have to be, beautiful one." Ra's sighs as his magic seeps into the renewed seals. Tim has had these seals since he was eight winters old. He thinks that as much as he hates them, it would be odd not to have their constant presence. Not that he has not worked out ways to get around their power. Tim blinks.</p><p>"You have changed them."</p><p>"You are the High Consort." Ra's replies, raising an eyebrow, "And my blade. It would not do if you were as limited as before."</p><p>"Does your council know how much slack you have put on my leash?" Tim pulls his hands away,  opening and closing his hands, testing the new boundaries he has been given. It would not take much effort at all to slip these reigns. No, in fact – Tim breathes, shudders, and shifts. Tim opens his eyes, and it takes a moment for his vision to clear, for him to sort out and understand the mix of magic, <em>seithr</em>, color, and heat that paints the world for him. "Or perhaps they do know and could not fight you on it?"</p><p>Ra's' fingers are light on the side of Tim's jaw, "They only mandate that you carry the seals, beloved one. Not that the seals have to be especially strong or binding."</p><p>Tim laughs, frost crackling and creeping over the metal of his bangles and freezing over the bells around his ankle. Tim tastes <em>seithr</em> on his lips, and pulls away from Ra's. Tim gathers <em>seithr</em> and magic in between his fingers, revels in the sensation of drawing his hand through it, and clasps his hands together. As he pulls them apart he forms an intricate figure of ice and energy.</p><p>"I hope you realize that now that I have my powers once more, I will be rather cross with you if you were to try and take them back." Tim says, looking into Ra's' face – his heart stops, rabbits, fast and excited, when he sees the look of pride and anticipation in Ra's' eyes. Ra's summons his own blade, green-jade and amber <em>seithr</em> that is flame and not-flame -</p><p>"I would expect nothing less from you, my consort."</p><p>-</p>

</p><p>"Well, well, well. Is that shame and guilt I smell in the air? I do believe it is." Tim says, as soon as Ra's enters their rooms. To the man's credit, he does not look surprised or upset, just resigned to the teasing Tim is going to be throwing at him for the foreseeable future.</p><p>"You were watching." Ra's says, and there's only a miniscule drop in the proud line of his shoulders as he turns to Tim.</p><p>"From the secret panel? Yes. I was. Well. Jason, Cassandra, Dick, Rose, and I were." It was fun. It was a good bonding session for them all to be together. Normally Tim would suggest sparring, but he is not quite up to that yet. Perhaps in a week or so he will be recovered enough to return to his normal level of training. "Come here and let me smell you. She looked like the type of woman to use a floral scent – was it floral? Rose and Cassandra have fourteen gold pieces that her scent was spiced. I want to prove them wrong."</p><p>Ra's' expression shifts from resigned to mildly horrified. Tim sits up, reaching out to pull at the man's robes.</p><p>"I am not mad, if that is what you are thinking." Tim replies. "I can see the appeal. Those ample breasts, her quivering lower lip. Not to mention those shapely hips. I believe the term is <em>birthing</em> hips? You could get a few heirs out of her, yet. And so <em>young</em>, too. Younger than me, even. What is she – fourteen? Fifteen? Has she bled yet, do you think?"</p><p>"You are <em>cruel</em> to me, my blade." Ra's sighs, even as Tim bursts out into new laughter. Ra's folds himself down in front of him with all the dignity a man caught red-handed can. Tim reaches up to run a hand through Ra's' hair, pulling him closer -</p><p>"Ah, I was right. Flowers." Tim says, "And who was the other one? Jason had told me that there was only one that the court had put forward to try and replace me. But there were <em>three</em>. I think even Cassandra was shocked at the audacity. If you can hardly keep <em>me</em> satisfied, my King, I do wonder how they expect you to keep <em>three</em> Consorts at once."</p><p>"How can you say I do not satisfy you?" Ra's replies, raising an eyebrow.</p><p>"You have not been to my rooms lately. I have barely seen you at all." Tim replies, "I get <em>lonely</em>."</p><p>"Now you mock me." Ra's removes Tim's hand from his hair, standing to remove his dress robes. Tim rises to his feet to help, "I tolerate them, beloved one, but only just. It seems hardly fair of me to get mad at their unwilling puppets when the one who has truly drawn my ire is their puppeteer."</p><p>"You just like the attention." Tim prods, folding the heavy robes and setting them aside. "The second one was a boy. How old was that one? Has his voice cracked? <em>Oh</em>, perhaps that is why he does not speak. How <em>charming</em>. How young do you think they are going to go, do you think?"</p><p>"<em>Beloved</em>." Ra's warns – Tim waves a hand before reaching around to undo Ra's' sash.</p><p>"I know. I jest, I jest. This is just so <em>amusing</em>. And you must admit that after these past few weeks I could use some laughter. I know you would not <em>dare</em> lay with another. Even if I <em>were</em> to become a pathetic, mindless, drooling bag of bones." Tim says, running a hand over Ra's' shoulder to soothe him. "You are a man of your word, and nothing would make you break your vow of loyalty to me. I simply find entertainment in your attempts at keeping a cool head when children fling themselves at you left and right."</p><p>"Children." Ra's sighs. "The third – "</p><p>"You need not tell me of the third." Tim says, slipping behind Ra's to lift off his under-armor, "She has an ample figure and golden hair. Fair skin and sultry thighs. She came the closest to tempting you, I would think."</p><p>Tim hooks his chin over Ra's' shoulder, arms circling around Ra's' waist. He is enjoying this, it is not often that he can make this man uncomfortable and it is <em>fun</em>. Oh, how the tables have turned.</p><p>"I am very glad that you did not actually succumb to her wiles, my King. She would have done her level best to snap your neck. And she is a terrifying screamer."</p><p>Dick had told him that Barbara had grown concerned with Tim's lack of responses and with his condition. The woman's own network of spies rivals his own, and her favorite operative is deadlier than Jason and Cassandra combined when riled enough.</p><p>"The Black Canary." Ra's sighs, "You sent the Black Canary to tempt me."</p><p>"I did not. The Oracle of the west, did. She does like to keep you on your toes. And make sure you are a loyal and good husband to her favorite ally." Tim says, smiling as wide as he pleases when Ra's turns around to give him a sullen look. "Just because I fall for a little does not mean my allies will fall with me, my King. My network is a many-headed beast."</p><p>-</p><p>"Sister, do you remember the question I asked you all those years ago, when I first became the Commander of the King's armies?" Tim asks, turning to Cassandra. He cannot see her face behind her mask and the low cut of her hood, but he can see the way her hands fist at her sides.</p><p>"I remember."</p><p>"Is this proof enough?" Tim says, gesturing towards the bodies before them.</p><p>Cassandra is quiet for a moment before she raises her face, eyes glinting in the candlelight. "Yes, blood-brother. It is proof."</p><p>"Then I am afraid that I am going to have to ask you to do something that I should never have a need to ask you to do." Tim says, kneeling down to close the corpse's eyes. "I am sorry, for what it is worth, my sister. To make you do something you are not willing – "</p><p>"I am willing." Cassandra says, Tim raises his eyes to her. Heat curls in her words, hands trembling at her sides. "They were innocent."</p><p>"Yes." Merchants who peddled their wares from distant villages. They made a pittance but they were happy. Tim knows this, because he spoke with them often, and bought as much of their wool as he could. They were happy people. Tim wonders if their families are still alive. If they are alright. And how they will survive, now.</p><p>"They were our allies. <em>She</em> was supposed to be our ally. If not our friend, if not our family – then she should have been on our side. <em>She was duty bound to be on our side</em>."</p><p>"They were. She was."</p><p>"She threatened them. Then killed them for their silence. They only – they only wanted to survive." Cassandra's hands still. "She is a traitor – she – <em>she had always been a traitor</em>."</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"All these years – how much has she done? <em>How much of this is her doing</em>?"</p><p>"I do not know." Tim is afraid to look closer. He fears how he would react if he put together the dots that are lining themselves up, even as they speak. From the look on his sister's face, she has no such hesitations.</p><p>She snarls. "No more suffering. No more deaths. <em>Shiva dies</em>."</p><p>-</p><p>For a moment, just for a moment, Tim is back in the cage.</p><p>The air smells like piss and blood and feces and unwashed flesh. And Tim stares into the eyes of the animals in the cages, the hate and the fear and Tim's heart seizes.</p><p>Burning flesh. Crying. Whimpers. Muffled cries. The slap of skin on skin. Bruises blooming, cuts bursting open, skin turning black. Flies. Endless flies.</p><p>Cassandra touches Tim's shoulder and Tim jerks back to the present.</p><p>"Buy them." Tim says to one of his guards, "Buy all of them."</p><p>"Yes, High Consort."</p><p>They do not ask, because his guards all know. They are with him for every moment of every day. They have all seen the brands and heard him speak. He was the animal in the cage.</p><p>Cassandra squeezes his shoulder and Tim tears his eyes away. He knows that Ra's will tease him later – that there is no more room in any of the gardens for his acquisitions and that the jungles around the city are suspiciously dangerous. But he will not stop Tim from doing it again. And again. And again.</p><p>Tim runs his thumb over one of his seals, and he thinks it is a phantom pain – an imaginary feeling – that makes his brands feel like they are on fire again.</p><p>"You have a soft heart." Cassandra says.</p><p>"A heart of ice is a heart of water." Tim replies, pulling his hood and scarf higher over his features before climbing out of the palanquin. He reaches past the bars of one of the cages to run a hand over a sluggishly bleeding chimera. Many of these creatures will die. But he will give them a painless death. He will give them peace.</p><p>He will make sure that they die under open skies, surrounded in the <em>seithr</em> of happiness.</p><p>The chimera's eyes are glazed over and Tim's heart aches for the creature. It is not unusual for animals to be sold on the streets. And it is not unusual for them to be more and more hurt, beaten, the farther away from the main market centers you travel.</p><p>(The slaves, the flesh-market is below. Underground. Hidden from the light of day and away from the judgment of the open skies. Tim never visits <em>that</em> area. No. Not as High Consort. But as Robin. As the red-cloaked one who gives the sky back to the branded.)</p><p>"To be brought so low," Tim whispers to Cassandra, "Does it not hurt you? To see something so proud, so strong, brought to this?"</p><p>"It is the way of men." Cassandra replies, "Look around you, and you will see it everywhere, little brother."</p><p>She touches his arm, just before where his arm passes through the bars.</p><p>"Come. Do not dwell on this. Its suffering shall soon be over."</p><p>"Yes." Tim says, standing, "I just wish that it did not have to suffer so in the first place."</p><p>-</p><p>There is no feast for Rose's return. For they do not see her coming and there is nothing to prepare for her. It is the heart of deep winter, and they live off the stores from the gathering and what meager game they can find with the help of Mac-<em>amme's</em> kin.</p><p>Tim feels her coming – a whisper in his slowly growing horns that echoes into his ribs and through his hands. A message from <em>Ymir</em>.</p><p>Rose returns with one eye, and a new lean-ness to her face.</p><p>Slade pulls her close and knocks his horns against hers. Mother and the other women whisk her away for a bath and to be dressed in something clean.</p><p>Father clasps Slade's hand in his, "Your flesh is strong."</p><p>There is not much to be had, but there is good game left, and there is some honey in the store room. It is not a true feast. Not the kind someone who has survived <em>Ymir</em> should have.</p><p>They eat and they drink as winter batters the stone, and Tim rests his head on Rose's knee. She holds her hands out and the <em>seithr</em> is <em>Ymir-</em>touched. Like his. She weave-chants the <em>seithr</em> into something cold, something harsh. Something like staring into a pure black sky and tastes like drowning in deep-water. She sing-shows them her journey through <em>Ymir's</em> spine and how she unlocked her <em>hamask</em>. She tells them how the deep-dweller rose in her blood and swallowed her whole, but how it was the Twin-Raven's wings who swept her back into her own flesh.</p><p>She weaves to them the feeling of the deep-dweller's battle-growth.  How it made her flesh knit before her eyes and how it made her bones feel like they had turned to stone.</p><p>She speaks of how <em>Ymir</em>'s well gaped open before her, and how she felt her hand moving towards her eye without her permission. But she knew, she knew that this is what <em>Ymir</em> would ask of her. And she knew he would reward her gift with great power.</p><p>And the Twin-Ravens came to her. The sister-raven with her blind eyes came and pecked at her fingers, and the brother-raven with no tongue landed on her shoulder. And they gave her sight.</p><p>She weaves her journey home, and how she worried that she would not survive so far away when the true-winter drew so close.</p><p>Tim drinks her <em>seithr</em> in, and feels warm.</p><p><em>Ymir</em> is pleased.</p><p>-</p><p>"Get up, you lazy bones. There are things to do, and daylight is burning."</p><p>Tim groans, curling deeper into the covers, arm curling around a pillow as he rolls himself up in blankets. It has finally gotten cold enough that in his southern form, Tim can peacefully enjoy the heavy down blankets that now serve as his bedding. Though when he shifts back to his true skin he gets a little overheated. Shame.</p><p>The blankets are <em>so soft</em>.</p><p>"There is no daylight, it is winter. It is cloudy and wet and perfect for napping and sleeping in." Tim protests.</p><p>"<em>Lazy</em>." Jason says, grabbing Tim's exposed ankle before he can pull it back into the safety of his blankets. Jason pulls, Tim curls around a pillow, disappearing into his cocoon of bedding. "Come on. Up. You need a bath and a meal."</p><p>"I need <em>sleep</em>." Tim protests, "I was up all night in the rain tracking slave-movements with Cassandra. And then when I came back I went to check in on the King and my hips hurt and my eyes hurt and <em>I am so tired</em>. Jason, I only just came here when the sun started to come up."</p><p>"Then you should have gone to bed right away instead of going for a lay." His brother declares, merciless as he yanks, Tim yelps, scrambling for a handhold as Jason starts dragging him. The bedding works against him and Tim only gets one arm out in time to drag the rest of the bedding off the mattress with him as he hits the floor. "Off we go. Bath time for the lazy High Consort."</p><p>"I am the High Consort! I can sleep in if I want to!" Tim tries to unravel himself from the mess of blankets and only succeeds in tangling himself up further. Tim lets out a frustrated hiss, clawing at the carpet as Jason drags him towards the baths. "Let me go!"</p><p>"Nope." Jason sounds entirely too happy as he drags Tim through the halls. "Time for the little baby brother to have his bath."</p><p>"You treat me like a child!"</p><p>"You <em>are</em> a child." Jason laughs, "In my heart you will always be the round-faced little baby who cried the first time he ate a chili."</p><p>"I was <em>eight</em> and I did not know what a <em>chili was and you were mean and took advantage!</em>" Tim yells, "Let it <em>go</em> already!"</p><p>-</p><p>So far away from the eyes of the court, Tim is free to slip his seals as often and as much as he pleases.</p><p>Tim holds small chips of ice to Ra's' mouth as the man lies on the cool tile floor. "I did not think that the Lazarus flame would take so much from you."</p><p>"It burns all things away, my blade." Ra's replies, "Which is why I am so reluctant to use it. It will take me time to rebuild my strength to where it should be."</p><p>"You have no callouses. Which is frankly disturbing." Tim says, holding one hand over Ra's' forehead, and using the other to create more ice chips. "Is this why Jason was gone for so long?"</p><p>"In part." Ra's replies, "The Lazarus also causes a madness of sorts. I do not know the particulars of what occurred with Jason. Talia sent him away so quickly, afterwards."</p><p>Tim knows, he did not even get a chance to say goodbye. Or a <em>welcome home</em> for that matter. The only reason he knew Jason was alive, at the time, was because Cassandra had the grace to stop by in the middle of the night and help him sneak out to watch Jason leave.</p><p>"I did not know that the royal family had so many estates." Tim says. They have been here for a little under a week and Tim is still discovering new and fascinating things. The Palace of Feathered Suns is a two week ride from the Imperial city, and is surrounded by grassland. It is a beautiful place, rolling green as far as the eye can see, though Tim does know that about a day's ride from here towards the south is the beginning of sand and desert plains. "What are they for? You never vacation here."</p><p>Ra's opens his eyes, "They are for the Consorts. There used to be many of us, my blade. I had many children, and those children had children. And the consorts of those children were numerous. They could not all be held in the Consort's Garden."</p><p>Tim wonders what happened to them. Ra's' eyes slip closed again as he sighs.</p><p>"I have taken to using them for safe havens. Places where I can recover from the Lazarus flame. Where I can send my children when they clash too much with the court. Though I have had little use of any of them, as of late. Tell me, what news do you have of the rebellion?"</p><p>"It is gone, like a whisper on the wind. Not a trace of its source to be found, or any lingering remains of its members. My whisperers grow frustrated." Tim replies, "I apologize, my king. I have failed as both your Commander and your blade."</p><p>If Tim were in the Imperial city, he would be turning the entire goddamn country over to shake these traitors out. But Ra's has asked him to stay at his side, and to come with him, so Tim must be content with leaving things to the others in the capital.</p><p>"The fault does not lie with you. My foe must be truly devious and wily to slip through even your fine net." Ra's says, lightly brushing Tim's hand of his forehead as he sits up. "Spar with me."</p><p>"I always lose." Tim says, but gets up anyway. "And it is only worse now, that the years have burned off you and you can see again."</p><p>"Are you calling me blind?"</p><p>"Yes. And while we are at it, deaf, slow, and creaky." Tim replies, moving to pick up the training swords from where they had been abandoned earlier. "And now you are annoyingly sharp, even without your callouses or muscle. It vexes me greatly how I keep losing to you."</p><p>"Then your only solution is to keep attacking." Ra's replies, "And I have many lessons I have yet to teach you, my blade. Do not think that I have revealed everything to you."</p><p>"I expect nothing less of you. You are as old are dirt, I would hope that you would have at least <em>one</em> surprise left up your sleeve."</p><p>"The way you talk to your king," Ra's clicks his tongue as he takes the wooden sword from Tim's outstretched hand, "It is scandalous."</p><p>"If I did not talk to you like you were a normal person, no one would. Is that not my duty as your blade? To keep your head attached to your neck, and make sure it does not swell so large it falls clean off?" Tim snorts, "And you may be my king, but as far as I can tell it is just a word that means you are slightly wealthier than everyone else."</p><p>"Your words wound me."</p><p>"If only my strikes could do the same."</p>

</p><p>Tim flinches when Dick pierces his flesh with the needle, one hand dropping to Tim's shoulder to steady him.</p><p>"There we go. Not so bad." Dick says, "Be careful with it. We do not want that getting infected, do we?"</p><p>"No." Tim says, patiently waiting as Dick wipes away blood. It stings a little, and the weight of the new metal is odd. Tim turns his head, feeling the strange sensation. it is different than the rings he used to wear on his horns. He could not feel those. These he does feel, but perhaps in time, when the holes have healed some, he will not feel them either.</p><p>Dick hands him a mirror as he puts away the needle and cloth. The earrings are plain gold. Strange and warm looking on his pale skin. Two in each ear.</p><p>"You want anything else done, while I am at it?" Dick asks, and Tim wrinkles his nose.</p><p>"I think the two are enough." Tim answers. He has seen courtiers with metal on their chest and he has heard from Jason that some of them even have metal on their sexes. Some have metal on their tongues, their navels, on their noses, their lips and even their brows.</p><p>Tim thinks that he is content with his ears.</p><p>"What brought this on, if I may ask?" Dick reaches over to tuck some of Tim's hair behind his ear. Tim leans into the touch for a moment before straightening up.</p><p>"The clips itch." Tim hopes that now that he has the proper holes, Selina will not pester him with the earrings that pinch and squeeze and clasp on his skin. They are so <em>heavy</em> and make his ears hurt and itch. Tim wrinkles his nose, and they are so <em>big</em>. "I figured that it would just be easier this way."</p><p>"As long as you take care of them properly, yes." Dick says, "Cass used to have some but hers got infected and closed. It was very painful for her. But she was also very young at the time and not very keen on sitting still to wash them every morning. Shall I trim your hair while I am at it?"</p><p>Tim's mind flashes to last night – and he <em>does not flush</em>. He really doesn't. Dick raises an eyebrow, Tim bites his lip and looks down.</p><p>"Or is there a reason why you let it get so long, little brother? Ah. Perhaps I should not ask. I do not think I want to know about the – ah. Pleasures of the King."</p><p>Tim reaches out to punch Dick's shoulder, letting out a frustrated groan when Dick catches Tim's fist and pulls him into a hug.</p><p>"You know, when it was first announced that you were to be the High Consort I was <em>concerned</em>." Dick says into Tim's hair. Tim curls his arms around Dick's chest and rests his ear against Dick's chest. Dick's heart is steady and loud in Tim's ear, and Dick smells like the sun and fresh rain. "You have been a soldier, a tool to the empire almost your entire life, little brother. And for all that you are rebellious and stubborn, you have always taken orders well. You never ask for things. Not anything for yourself, at least."</p><p>Tim closes his eyes, and sinks into the feeling of Dick's hands slowly rubbing his shoulders.</p><p>"I was scared that you were only saying <em>yes</em> because you felt you had to." Tim starts to pull back, denial on the tip of his tongue when Dick tightens his hold. "But I can see that is not the case. And I am so relieved, little brother. I come home and I see you happy and you are thriving better than anyone could have ever expected you to, I think. I was not such a good brother to Jason, and I do not think I have done right by you, either. I am away too long to be. But I am glad that you have found happiness, Tim. Truly I am."</p><p>Dick's back is wide and trembling underneath Tim's fingertips, as Tim squeezes Dick back.</p><p>"You are not a poor brother." Tim says, "You have always done what was best for us when you could. And you have many responsibilities to many people all over the continent. We know this. We do not love you less because you cannot be with us, always. I am glad you are my brother, Dick. I am glad I came here, if only because I could have you and Jason and Cassandra at my side."</p><p>-</p><p>"Did you just go <em>here, kitty, kitty</em> at a <em>pyretera?" </em>Connor gapes as Tim clicks his tongue at the large, orange-eyed cat.</p><p>"Well, it worked, did it not? Why, what else was I supposed to do? Tackle it to the ground after chasing it around the garden?" Tim rolls his eyes, rubbing his hands underneath the large cat's chin when he comes close enough to touch. The cat's body is hot, but his fur is soft and the cat's eyes close in pleasure as Tim reaches for the good scratching spots. "And he is not so fierce. Look at him, he is a giant babe."</p><p>"Only <em>you</em>, my friend," Connor laughs, hand on his forehead, "Would call one of the fiercest predators known in the Land of the Eternal Edas a <em>giant babe</em>."</p><p>"But he is!" Tim protests, leaning back as the cat sprawls on his side, belly up, head twisting in Tim's lap. "Look at him. He is like a small dragon, perhaps. A yearling." Tim scratches the cat's belly, leaning away from his mouth to avoid the puff of smoke that comes out when he purrs. "Would you like to pet him?"</p><p>"I think I will pass." Connor replies, running a hand over one of the reaching out to keep one of the baby rabiflies from tripping over itself. "My hands are full with these little ones, I should think."</p><p>"They breed so fast." Tim says, "I do not know what to do with them."</p><p>"Sell them, perhaps." Connor says, "Their wings are quite lovely."</p><p>"Yes, I did not know they could be that color. I thought all the rabiflies were blue and green."</p><p>"No, there are quite a few near the southern coast of the empire that are red and orange." Connor says, shaking his head, petting one of the more aggressive ones. "I thought the pyrtera was coming to eat them."</p><p>"They are too fast to be caught." Tim laughs, "And he is a spoiled baby who likes to be pet. He reminds me of someone."</p><p>"If you say the King I will have to leave in order to get the image out of my mind." Connor warns him. "And I might never return because the images are so traumatizing."</p><p>"Get whatever it is out of your mind. I am starting to think that your brother and sister are a terrible influence on even <em>your</em> stalwart mind." Tim snorts, moving his hand in time to avoid the sparks that come out of the pyrtera's mouth when he snaps his jaws in a lazy yawn. "And the King <em>is a big whiny baby</em>."</p><p>-</p><p>"The poison," Roy says, fingers pressing against points on Tim's skin as he checks Tim's magic, "is very old. It is considered a dark art."</p><p>"Where from?" Dick asks, Jason's hand is warm between Tim's shoulders as he helps prop Tim up. "Do you know who would know it?"</p><p>"It originates in the land of the Edas." Roy says, "But it was perfected in the southern isles. It is the poison of the Lotus Eater. Are you familiar with the legend?"</p><p>"No." Tim replies.</p><p>"I am." Dick says, "An island of beautiful lotus blossoms. But any who ate their petals became sluggish and fell into eternal dreams, refusing to eat or move or even close their eyes."</p><p>"Yes. While there is no island of such flowers, a mixture of certain plants and magic can produce a similar effect." Roy says, reaching into his bag for a small wooden box. "Over time, the poison of the Lotus Eater has been refined and combined with many other spells and workings. I believe you are familiar with the <em>geas</em>?"</p><p>"It originates in the North. So yes. But it was not a <em>geas</em> that came out of me." Tim answers, watching as Roy pulls out small glass vials of twisting, glittering smoke and whispering powders. He feels <em>seithr</em> moving within them. Spirits, Tim thinks. Remnants of fire. Just what Tim needs. More flame. "It was dark, dull. And <em>wet</em>. Solid."</p><p>"Are you familiar with the variant, the <em>tynged</em>?"</p><p>"No." Tim says after a moment, "Perhaps Slade or Rose would know. But I cannot say that I am."</p><p>"It is a younger version of the <em>geas</em>." Roy explains, "And often done against someone's will. I believe that it is a mix of the <em>tynged</em> and the Lotus Eater poison that did this to you. The <em>tynged</em> would have fed off of your life energy while putting you under the control of whoever cast it upon you. And the poison kept you from noticing any manipulations. What I do not understand, however, is how it got to you. Dick said that all of your magic was purged. If the <em>gaea's </em>energies purified yours, the poison should have fled with it."</p><p>"Or perhaps the purging of my energy just removed the barriers between this dark magic and my magical core." Tim replies. "Is there any of it left within me?"</p><p>"I would say <em>no</em>, if it is true that the Lazarus flame and <em>Ymir</em> truly did what you say they did." Roy says, opening the vials and pouring them into his palm, "But at this point I think we all want to be better safe than sorry, eh? Breathe deep. And try not to vomit."</p><p>Tim is about to ask what Roy means, when the man shoves his palm at Tim's face, and Tim inhales the scent of death and rot. Tim gags, eyes watering, and Jason's hands turn firm as Tim curls in on himself.</p><p>Tim curls his toes and squeezes his eyes shut. His nose burns, and it feels like whatever it is that he inhaled is moving within him. Spreading.</p><p>"I would apologize, but. Yeah." Roy says, "Sorry, lil'mano."</p><p>"I hate you." Tim gasps out, eyes stinging. "I hope this is supposed to actually do something."</p><p>"If there is anything left in you, it should burn it out. Your magic seems normal, if depleted. I'm more concerned with how it builds up over the next few days."</p><p>"Can you explain more about the poison?" Jason asks, passing Tim off to Dick who holds a cloth to Tim's face. Tim sneezes into it, vision blurring as tears spill over. "How it works, exactly?"</p><p>"I am not sure." Roy says. Tim hears the sound of more vials. He swears that he's going to kick the man in the throat if he shoves more of this into Tim's face. Good friend or <em>no</em>. "But the <em>tynged</em> must have still been bound to the caster if Tim could still see it moving and growing. I think that it must have been using his own energy to power the spell and connection."</p><p>"Life energy?"</p><p>"No. Physical, which – combined with the effects of the Lotus Eater, is why Tim is so. Uh. Thin."</p><p>"Weak. You can say it. I am weak. I am skin and bones and look like I died." Tim says, sniffling as he blinks tears away. "But as soon as I get my strength back kicking you in the ass is somewhere on the top of my list for not giving me more of a warning about that, Harper."</p><p>Roy grins, unabashed and amused, "You can try, brat. But you're a few years too early and I will wipe the tile with your face any day."</p><p>"Can you guys wait with the taunting until we figure out who tried to assassinate and then control you?" Jason says, reaching over to smack Roy over the head. "Do you think we could trace it?"</p><p>"If we still had the stone, maybe. But we do not, and I think it is all the better for that." Roy says, scratching his chin, "The stone was, perhaps, a physical manifestation of the energy being taken from Tim. Destroying it probably gave enough of it back to you for you to punch the King in the face. Momentarily, of course."</p><p>"Of course."</p><p>"I still cannot believe you punched him in the <em>face</em>." Jason snorts. Tim turns on him, waving hand -</p><p>"Well where <em>else</em> was I supposed to punch him?"</p><p>"He is the King of the empire, and your <em>husband</em>, <em>don't punch him at all</em>."</p><p>"Can we please get back on topic of <em>what exactly poisoned my little brother and why</em>?" Dick cuts in. Tim ducks his head in embarrassment. His thoughts feel all over the place – he has so many things to do and all of it must be done <em>now</em>.</p><p>"I do not know who or the why." Roy says, mixing some powder and leaves together with some water in a bowl, "But the point of the thing was to: one, weaken Tim physically, mentally, and spiritually; two, make his mind malleable to an outside force; and three, remove him from power."</p><p>"This is just a small piece of the puzzle." Tim sighs, "Something big is coming, and I do not know what."</p><p>Roy dips his fingers into the paste, humming an incantation that makes his eyes spark gold before he marks Tim's forehead.</p><p>"There, this should help the burning." He says, "And, <em>gaea</em> willing, it will keep you safe, as well."</p><p>It smells cool, like mint, and feels pleasant on Tim's skin. Tim closes his eyes as Roy draws a line down his nose.</p><p>"Too many things are happening at once." Jason says, "I take it back, Tim. I am no longer bored."</p><p>"I would hope so." Dick snorts, "An assassination attempt to cover an assassination attempt that doubles as a mind-control attempt. And all of it as just a smaller component of a greater mystery. I do believe we have our work cut out for us."</p><p>"I do not know who or why someone did this to me." Tim says, "But I do know that they are not going to get away with it, and I will make them <em>bleed</em> for thinking that they could use me as part of their schemes."</p><p>"And that is the little brother we all know and love." Dick sighs, kissing Tim's hair, "Welcome back, Tim. Did I mention how much I have missed it when you are both adorable and mean? Because I truly have."</p><p>-</p><p>"My mother was of the north." Jason explains, and Tim has to focus very hard to understand his words. He speaks in a mix of this new southern tongue and an old western dialect that Tim has only heard in passing. "I do not know my father. But she told me of the stead she came from and that she was taken away to the west."</p><p><em>Like you</em>, goes unspoken.</p><p>"But it was nice. She was happy. She earned her freedom and there are many of us half-lings to keep each other safe." Jason says, "And there are many half-lings here, too. Just not from the north. Many slaves. Many servants. Many poor-folk. They come here because they are forced to. Because there is no other way to get food or shelter. Or because they hope to advance in the world."</p><p>Tim holds out his arms to help carry the baskets of laundry Jason is helping to move, and gets his hair ruffled. Tim stiffens for a moment, but relaxes into the touch. It is strange – how people touch each other so freely, here. Stranger to stranger. And for all that Jason is half-frost, he is still a stranger. Not for long, though. Tim thinks that he and Jason will be great friends.</p><p>In the mean time, Tim trails after him and repeats words that Jason points out and does his best to answer him in this new language. It is hard and there are so many names for everything, so many <em>words </em>that mean nothing but he must use anyway. It is dizzying, but Jason is a fair teacher, and Tim thinks he has caught on fairly quick.</p><p>Jason gives him a sweet that he snagged from one of the washer-women – they seem to like Jason a lot. They find him charming. – and nudges Tim towards the palace.</p><p>"Come on. It is cooler inside and we can find something to read." Jason says, "We do not have practice today and we have time until the afternoon meal."</p><p>Tim is busy licking sticky residue off his fingers, tasting the salt of his skin and the sweet-sour of the sticky dried fruit Jason had handed him. So he does not notice much until they enter the library. It is a large, beautiful room full of light and shelves and glittering blue tile.</p><p>He stares in awe, at all the books and scrolls and paper. It is a treasure trove, and Tim wonders how they take care of it in the rain season.</p><p>Jason pulls Tim over towards one of the shelves in the back and points out titles of books as he goes.</p><p>"This one is about the history of the royal family. That one is about magic. Oh! And this one is about a story of a legendary prince slaying a great and angry dragon." Tim bites his lip, "That one up there is about dragons. And the ones next to it are about serpents. Over there, that shelf is filled with books on birds. Ah! Here is the one – this section is all about cats."</p><p>Tim perks up, turning towards the shelves, raising his hands to his head to imitate the ears, "Meow?"</p><p>"Yeah! Meow! Those ones. You want to read?"</p><p>"I do not know how to read." Tim says. Not this language, anyway. Tim is fairly good at reading runes and dragon-scrawl.</p><p>"Good, then I can teach you." Jason says, pulling books from the shelves, "It is always best to learn to read on something you are interested in, yes?"</p>

</p><p>It is on one of those strange nights, where the night refuses to be the night, and is a mixture of bright pearlescent light from <em>Ymir's</em> eye – "The <em>moon</em>, Tim. It is called <em>the moon</em>."- and oddly bright <em>seithr </em>that casts a soft, warm glow on everything. Tim leans his cheek on his fist and watches the slow rise and fall of Ra's' sides as he sleeps. His back is not broad. Tim wonders if it is his imagination, or perhaps the fault of memory, that makes him think they should be broader.</p><p>Or perhaps, in time, they will continue to grow, as Ra's does. Tim wonders. He wonders about many things. The King most of all.</p><p>He is a man of many, many secrets. That is – it is alright. Tim has many secrets as well. He thinks that is a given for both of them.</p><p>Ra's is a man with <em>centuries</em> of experience, lifetime upon lifetime of power and knowledge from his mastery of the Lazarus flame. He has ruled over this nation since almost its conception. He has had many lovers, many enemies, many children, many deaths. There is much that he knows, and for all that he pretends to be a benevolent and patient King, Tim knows that there is power and cruelty in him. Tim can see it, sometimes.</p><p>And it only makes sense. How else could the empire have gotten so big and stayed so strong? For all that he constantly mocks his husband and teases him to the point of exasperation, Tim is well aware that the man lying next to him is perhaps the most dangerous man on the continent.</p><p>That is not to say that <em>Tim</em> cannot be dangerous if he does not want it.</p><p>"I would say, <em>a penny for your thoughts</em>." Ra's says, Tim frowns at the man's back.</p><p>"My thoughts are hardly worth a <em>penny</em>." Tim mutters, "I thought you were sleeping."</p><p>"I could feel you gazing so intently at me that I woke." Ra's replies, back still facing Tim. "And I said I <em>would</em> say that, not that I will. Your thoughts are my own and I hardly see why I should pay for them in pennies."</p><p>"I am hardly <em>yours</em>." Tim huffs, lying down, resting his forehead against the nape of Ra's' neck. No matter what time of the day, or what time of the year, the man always smells like heat. "It is nothing."</p><p>Ra's reaches around, waiting until Tim gives him his hand. The man draws Tim's arm over his side, fingers sliding between his own.</p><p>"Tell me. It must be something to keep you awake. You always complain when I keep you."</p><p>"Sleep is one of the most important things in life. Any soldier worth their blade knows it." Tim protests, "And you keep me up for <em>no reason</em> other than to annoy me."</p><p>"Is that what they call it these days?"</p><p>Ra's' grip around Tim's hand tightens when Tim tries to smack him.</p><p>"What troubles you, most beloved one?" Ra's repeats, thumb running over Tim's knuckles. "I spend my days listening to grievances from the poorest of paupers to the most pampered of nobles. I would have yours as well."</p><p>"You take too much onto yourself." Tim says to Ra's' back, closing his hand into a fist, knuckles brushing against Ra's' skin. Perhaps it is because of the Lazarus' influence, but the man always seems to run hot. But then again, Tim knows he is cold. Jason has complained about it dozens, if not hundreds of times. Except in the summer. "So arrogant. Thinking that you can shoulder all the problems in this country."</p><p>"I am nothing if I cannot bear the problems of my people. I am less than nothing if I cannot be trusted with my own consort's worries."</p><p>"Just leave it." Tim says, closing his eyes. "It is nothing."</p><p>Ra's is quiet for so long that Tim thinks the man has, <em>for once in his life</em>, let it go.</p><p>"Your thoughts are not nothing. To me your thoughts are, very much, everything. And you do realize that once I have set my sights on something I do not let it go until I have it, yes?"</p><p>Tim feels his eye twitch.</p><p>"Go to <em>sleep.</em> You hold court in the morning and you are not going to cancel because you feel like a nap. <em>Again</em>."</p><p>"As my blade wishes." Ra's pulls at Tim's arm, pulling Tim flush against his back. "This discussion is not over."</p><p>"A discussion requires two parties." Tim replies against Ra's' skin, "And I, for one, will not be the other party."</p><p>-</p><p>"Do you think the princess is going to have a boy-child or a girl-child?" Jason asks them, when he finds them stargazing on one of the gratings that cover the outdoor hallways. He lies down next to them. Tim turns on his side.</p><p>"I do not know. She is not showing yet." Tim replies.</p><p>"If the swell is high it will be a girl." Cassandra says. "I hope that the babe is a boy."</p><p>"Why?"</p><p>"Because if the babe is a boy that automatically means he has the most favor in the court as heir." Cass replies. "And since neither you, I, or even Dick, wish to be heir, it would be best for all of us. The court has wanted a boy-child for <em>ages</em>. There has not been one since the former White Ghost, I think."</p><p>"But what if the boy does not want to rule?" Tim replies.</p><p>"A girl-child would be nice. I would like a little sister." Jason says.</p><p>"That is true. I would like a little sister, too." Cassandra replies, frowning. "Do you think we could be lucky and she will have twins?"</p><p>"I think that is asking for a little much, sister." Jason snorts. "Besides, Bruce would hardly know what to do with <em>one</em> baby, let alone <em>two</em>."</p><p>The three of them snicker at the thought of Bruce with a baby in each arm, with the same frown he wears on his face whenever he is confronted with a poorly written paper by one of the scholars, or a trainee's bad footwork.</p><p>"But a boy-child would not be so bad, I think." Tim says when they have calmed down, "You are good with little brothers. Any child would be happy to have you as their elders. I would know."</p><p>Cass reaches over Jason to pinch Tim's nose. "Flatterer."</p><p>Jason crosses his arms behind his head. "Yeah. A boy-child would not be so bad. He would not be married off, for one thing."</p><p>"And it would be easier to sneak a boy-child out to play and fight with." Cass points out. "They would try to force the girl child into complacency. And they would try to parade their children in front of her. A boy child they would leave alone, for a little while at least."</p><p>"It will be easier to tease a boy child." Jason says, tilting his head, "Because everyone loves a girl-child. I envy you, that, Cass. Everyone is always suspicious of me."</p><p>"Women are, by default, innocent and blameless in all things." Cass waves her hand. "Which is useful. A boy child. I think I like that idea."</p><p>-</p><p>"But what <em>are</em> they?" Tim says as Prudence laughs, "Where do they come from? Why?"</p><p>"Calm. They are just <em>freckles</em>. You ridiculous – " Prudence starts, cuts herself off and rolls her eyes as she strips sheets off of beds. "Do you just not get freckles in the north?"</p><p>"Freckles? Is that what they are called? Are they dangerous?" Tim shifts his weight from foot to foot, "Am I going to die?"</p><p>Owens giggles. Tim shoots the boy a glare -</p><p>"You were quarantined before you joined the army." Z soothes, pushing a dust cloth into Owen's hands and nudging the older boy towards the shelves, "You are not sick, and you have been given immunization to our diseases. Freckles are not a disease, they are not contagious, they will not kill you, and they are not harmful in anyway."</p><p>"They look kind of cute, if you ignore the fact that you are a snot-nosed brat." Prudence says, sticking out her tongue when Tim glares at her. "Calm down. It is just something that happens when you are in the sun too long."</p><p>"Z does not have any." Tim points out. "And he spends more time outside than any of us combined."</p><p>"It is harder for people with darker skin to freckle. Some people freckle more than others." Owens says, "Some people get sun burn, some people freckle, some people get darker. Like Pru over there. She turns bright red, like a pomegranate or a parrot,  if she is in the sun for too long."</p><p>"Shut <em>up</em>. So do <em>you</em>." Prudence says, smacking Owens upside the head.</p><p>"Are you <em>sure</em> it is normal?" Tim presses, "No one else has them."</p><p>"You are from the north so you probably have not seen many with it." Z says, "Perhaps your kind does not freckle in your normal skin. Or perhaps it looks different – what happens when you are out in the sun for too long?"</p><p>"Nothing. The sun does not shine as fiercely nor as long as it does here." Tim replies.</p><p>"That would explain why you have not seen it before. But it is common here, in the southern countries." Owens says, grunting as he moves to push his cot. Cleaning day is perhaps the hardest and most relaxed day of the month. It is hard work, to clean the barracks from top to bottom. But everyone gets to talk and people move freely between buildings. "If you do not believe us – and I see no reason why you <em>shouldn't</em> – "</p><p>"You almost tricked me into eating an <em>insect</em>."</p><p>"I thought you would know it was a walking leaf!"</p><p>"<em>I did not know there were such things!</em>"</p><p>" – just go ask Jason." Prudence cuts in, jerking her head towards where Jason is helping some other boys move pallets outside to be cleaned and sunned after having their straw replaced. "He has tons of them. All the girls talk about them whenever he goes into the training ring without his tunic."</p><p>Z and Owens wrinkle their noses. Tim looks between her and Jason before going over to the older boy. Jason blinks at him for a moment or two before shooting a look at the other three, eyebrow raised before shrugging. He turns around and pulls up his tunic to show Tim his back.</p><p>"They are not lying. This time." Jason says as Tim narrows his eyes at the sea of brown flecks over Jason's tanned back. "Freckles are not harmful. They are natural and not a bad thing.  Unless you hear the ladies of the court fretting. But they are whining babies who would fret over a stray hair. No, this is not like the time when we all told you that chilies were bland and just crunchy."</p><p>"Okay." Tim says, twisting his lips as he turns around to go back to helping Z move cots so that Prudence can sweep the area. "But if I find out that this is a trick, I am going to tell on you to Cassandra."</p><p>-</p><p>"What is this?" Tim asks, staring at the creature in the middle of Ra's' study. "What is that? Why is it here? How come you have not done any of your work? <em>You have a meeting with the master of coin in half an hour. Where is your work? Where are the reports?</em> You were supposed to have read the reports. I spent two days getting those reports together for you. After you <em>forgot to tell me about this meeting two months ago</em>. Did you lose the reports?"</p><p>"You are unusually verbose this morning." Ra's replies from where he's lounging. <em>Lounging</em>. Like he has the <em>time</em> for this. Tim glares at his head and reminds himself that he is sworn to protect this man's life at all costs. And that he <em>volunteered for this duty</em>. And Tim is a man of his word and he will not break it, along with the King's face.</p><p>Also he would probably lose and maybe get tried for treason and hanged. Or stabbed. Repeatedly.</p><p>Either way -</p><p>"Something about you slacking off while you have a country to run drags words out of me. I discover feelings I was not aware I was capable of possessing when I am around you, and frankly, it is dangerous for the health of all parties involved." Tim replies, "What is <em>this</em>?"</p><p>"It is a pup." Ra's says, arms folded over his stomach as he closes his eyes. "A baby dire wolf. I would assume you would know that, considering that they are from your land of birth. Have you been gone so long that you have forgotten?"</p><p>"I <em>know</em> – that isn't what I <em>meant</em>."</p><p>"That is what you asked."</p><p>The pup rolls onto its belly, ears laid back, tail curled around its legs as it stares up at Tim with large eyes. Tim hears Bruce's voice in his head telling him to breathe, calm down, and use his words. Violence is not always the answer when it comes to dealing with the royal family.</p><p>"W<em>hy is it here in your office</em>?" Tim wonders if it would be weak to give in to the urge to go straight to the healer's quarters so early in the morning to ask for a headache compress. He is starting to think that <em>they</em> think he has an addiction to the smell.</p><p>Maybe the alchemists would humor him? Maybe if he said it was a royal order. Or if he bribed them. He's sure he can bribe them with something. He'll <em>find</em> something to bribe them with. In these cases bribery works better than blackmail.</p><p>"I would think that is obvious." The King replies, raising an eyebrow. "It is your name-day."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"Are you growing deaf as well?" The King clicks his tongue, "You must take better care of yourself, Commander. You are young, yet, and it would be a shame if you had to step down from your post so soon after being appointed."</p><p>"If I ever step down from my post it will be because you have driven me insane and made me do something utterly incomprehensible." Tim snaps, kneeling down to scoop the pup into his arms. The pup squirms in Tim's arms, its pale blue eyes staring up at him balefully. Tim sticks his fingers into its mouth and pries it open to take a look at the teeth.It cannot be more than a few months old, perhaps freshly weaned. But it is – she, she is small.  Especially small for a female wolf of her coloring. Tim blinks, almost drops her when he remembers the King's words. "Is she my <em>name-day present</em>?"</p><p>The King opens one eye and just <em>looks</em> at him. Tim flushes, refuses to back down -</p><p>"Never mind that – how did you get her? And <em>are you ready for your meeting</em>? It is a meeting to determine the economy for the next year – where are your papers?"</p><p>Tim was ready to spit up blood by the time he had the papers in a somewhat coherent and presentable order. Jason was laughing at him while scolding him for using so many candles.</p><p>"She was found by a patrol. It would seem that some dire wolves had been brought from the north for breeding purposes." Ra's wrinkles his nose, closing his eyes again. Tim holds the pup tighter to his chest, fingers sinking into her thick, black fur. "They were all weakened. She would have been the runt of her litter. If any of the others had survived."</p><p>Tim's heart lurches in his chest – "She is alone?"</p><p>Not weaned then. If it was for breeding purposes – she would have been forced from her mother. Too young. And the runt, she would have been killed. But the breeders do love their money.</p><p>(Milk. Tim needs to get a rag and milk. And he is going to need to find some soft game for her, but he will have to teach her to hunt for her game as well – perhaps he can commandeer the use of one of the gardens. What should he get her for her teeth? Where will she sleep? Would it spoil her if he allowed her indoors or on his bed?)</p><p>"Well not if she has you." Ra's replies. "You will keep her."</p><p>"As opposed to what? What <em>else</em> am I supposed to do with her?" Tim snorts, cradling the pup in one arm, scratching her chin with the other. How like the King to give Tim a gift of such nature <em>then</em> ask if Tim would keep it. It is not as if he can say <em>no</em>. She squirms, small pink tongue lolling out of her mouth as she whines and yips at him. "You keep avoiding the question – are you ready?"</p><p>Ra's holds up the packet of reports Tim had gathered for him.</p><p>"Who, exactly, do you think you are speaking to, barbarian?" Ra's sits up, then standing in a fluid motion as he adjusts the fall of his robes. "You fret too much, you will get wrinkles that way."</p><p>"What happens to my face does not concern you. And if you cared about whether or not I got wrinkles you would not <em>make</em> me so stressed."</p><p>"You are my blade. Of course what happens to you concerns me. It would reflect poorly upon me for my blade to look so haggard. And I would not dream of making you stressed, Commander. Come. I think a walk is in order."</p><p>Tim makes a frustrated sound as the man breezes past him, the puppy makes a low noise of inquiry, tilting her head, opening her mouth to tug on Tim's uniform and chew on it.</p><p>"Yes. He is always like that." Tim says to her, gently prying his uniform out of her mouth and pulling off one of his gloves for her to gnaw on. "You get used to it or learn to imagine yourself beating something into the ground in order to tolerate it."</p><p>-</p>

</p><p>"You and my father are gone for one year and you come back as the High Consort to be." Talia says, Tim almost flushes. "I am not against it. I am simply wondering how you got from being his blade and his Commander to being in his bed."</p><p>"I have not <em>been</em> in his bed." Yet. The King – Ra's – is oddly traditional about that sort of thing. Not that Tim has not <em>tried</em>. Just that the man as a will of iron and is as bull-headed now as he was before his revival. "And to be quite honest I am not sure that I know, either."</p><p>Talia drums her nails on the her sword, and Tim waits.</p><p>"If it makes any sense, I am fairly sure that he tricked me into it." Tim says. Talia snorts before her gaze grows distant. Tim wonders if she is thinking of her mother. Tim follows her gaze into the King's garden. He can just make out the glitter of the gold and glass dome of the building known as the Consort's Gallery from here. It was built for Sora. She was not Talia's mother. But Talia's mother, Melisande must have lived there for a time as well. Before her assassination.</p><p>"Do you love my father?" She asks.</p><p>"No." Tim replies. He feels her gaze turn to him, sharp and hard like obsidian. Tim shrugs. "I do not understand what you mean by <em>love</em>. I do not think I love him. I do not know. What is this love you speak of? What does it mean to love someone? We do not have this word in the north. There are the bonds you share with your blood. Then there are the bonds of flesh and the bonds of womb. The bonds of bone. The temporary bonds of winter. The fleeting bonds of summer. The unwise but exhilarating bonds of spring and fall. I can say I love him, but what does that mean, princess."</p><p>Tim folds his hands together and looks at the clear sky.</p><p>"I do not know if I love your father, princess. But I know that I respect him. I know that he is a wise and powerful man. I have learned much from him."</p><p>"You see him as a mentor."</p><p>"Sometimes." Tim bites his cheek. "In these past two or so years of being his Commander and his blade, I think I have come to see him as more than that, though. I yell at him. I scold him. I support him. I answer his questions. I ask questions of him. I watch his back. I am his eyes and his ears. For the past two years my life has revolved around him. I wake up and I think <em>oh good, the country has not fallen about our ears</em>. I think <em>what does the King have to do today and how is he going to mess it up</em>. I think about how to protect his interests and how to anticipate what he wants so that I may have the way paved smooth by the time he has convinced others to follow his lead."</p><p>Tim clenches his hands.</p><p>"In every spare moment, with every breath, I think about how frustrating he is. I think about how he has taught me so much and how I am privileged to work so closely at his side. To be his blade." Tim releases his hands and turns to her. "But I had thought – yes. This is it. This is the apex of my journey. My life's road has taken me to this point, and from here I can see over many things. I am free and I am as strong as I ever will be. Then he asked me to be his consort. And I realized that I a was not finished. There is more. There will always be more. And he will show me the way." Tim holds out his hands, "At his side, surely I will see things from new  heights. I will have more power and I will have more opportunity. I will shape this country, at his side. I will shape it with my hands with him."</p><p>He lets his hands fall to rest on his knees.</p><p>"I do not know if I love your father, princess. And I will not lie and say that I cannot imagine life without him. I can. I can imagine myself saying <em>no</em> and remaining his blade and Commander until someone better comes to replace me, or when I fall or when I am too old and withered to serve. I can imagine running away to the north and building a <em>stead</em>. I can imagine leaving this country to see the things which your consorts and their wards have spoken to me about. I can imagine many other things that do not involve me saying <em>yes</em>. But I would not choose that life. I would choose him. I choose him. And perhaps that is the thing which you call <em>love</em>."</p><p>-</p><p>The thread is thin and slips through Tim's fingers as he ties it. Sweat beads over his forehead, and it is not worth the effort to shift and freeze the air around him with the frost of his <em>seithr</em>. Thought it would be fun to scare some of the new attendants. They have to learn just what they are dealing with sooner or later.</p><p>Cassandra raises a slow eyebrow at him from where she has tucked herself into a windowsill, one leg dangling out of the window, the other pulled against her chest. Her armor is discarded in a pile in the corner that will have Jason exploding into a rant on proper maintenance and care and how it is such a waste that such fine material is treated so poorly at his own sister's hands. Cassandra quirks up a lip, as if she is thinking of the same thing, and starts filing her nails.</p><p>"If you terrify any more servants, you will start to upset people."</p><p>"They are not <em>my</em> servants. I did not choose them." Tim points out. "I had an entire group trained and hand picked, tested and tried. It would not be a problem if the council would simply let me keep the people I want. Instead they protest that I am being <em>unfair</em>. That I am taking too many <em>resources</em>."</p><p>They both roll their eyes.</p><p>Tim picked them off the streets and out of cages and out of trenches. Out of sewers and out of hospitals and orphanages.</p><p>He trained them and sponsored them and worked with them side by side.</p><p>He has taken <em>nothing</em> from the palace-proper accept what has been gifted to him.</p><p>"They would curb your influence." Cassandra shrugs. "In light of recent events you have shown your teeth and you frighten them."</p><p>"I have always shown my teeth. How else did they think I won so many battles?" Tim snorts, giving up and setting aside the pillow case he was embroidering. His hands would dirty the cloth with his sweat and he is more likely to mess the pattern up when his mind is so – <em>sun-baked</em>. He will work on it at night.</p><p>The magic is better at night, anyway.</p><p>"Perhaps I should have said that you have shown your <em>horns</em>."</p><p>"Ah, yes. That does make a little bit more sense." Tim says, folding the cloth away and putting back his needle and thread. Tim sighs and lies back. "Have we gotten any reports from the southern isles?"</p><p>"None." Cassandra replies, "But you did send Jason there, so perhaps he is handling things well enough. It seems that when one thing passes another comes up."</p><p>"I think the expression is out of the pan and into the fire. Thought it seems like we are in a never ending series of pans."</p><p>"It is very exciting."</p><p>"Yes. And here I thought life as High Consort would be <em>boring.</em> Or – <em>Ymir forbid</em> – simple." Tim snorts, "Though, I suppose when the royal family is involved, nothing is simple. Not even sex."</p><p>"If only." Cassandra swings her legs back into the room, reaching out to close the lattice. "Have you ever considered taking a lover aside from the King?" She tilts her head, "I ask because many wives and husbands in nobles families do."</p><p>"I have asked utter loyalty from him. I will give him the same respect." Tim says. "And no. I am sure that there have been times when I have thought of how it would be to lay with another. But never seriously. Only fleeting, half-thoughts that disappear before I can even realize they are there." Tim shrugs, closing his eyes. "And besides. The King keeps me so busy I would never have time for a lover."</p><p>"Perhaps that is his plan."</p><p>Tim snorts. "What a poor plan it is, I sometimes do not even have the patience to bear with <em>his</em> affections at the end of the day."</p><p>"But you do." Cass points out. "You put up with a lot from the King."</p><p>"I do." Tim's lips curve up for a moment. "Is there a point to this conversation?"</p><p>"You once told me that you did not think you loved the King." Cass says. "After all that has happened – do you think that is still the same?"</p><p>Tim opens his eyes to gaze at the familiar tiled ceiling. he takes in the  mosaic of greens and turqoises, yellows and oranges.</p><p>"What do you see?" He asks. Turning his head to look at her. "When you look at me?"</p><p>"I told you that I am not a mind reader." Cass flicks his forehead, but lies down next to him. "I do not know what I see when I look at you, little brother. Sometimes I think that. I think that you love him. But then I remember that it is not the same for you. And sometimes you look at him like you want to fight him. To the death. And that you would be happy, even if you lost. I do not know what I see, only that I envy it. Sometimes."</p><p>"Sometimes?"</p><p>"Most of the time it makes my head hurt and want to get as far away from you as possible." She smiles. "And still, I am happy for you."</p><p>"Thank you."</p><p>"I never congratulated you on your joining." She says. "But I think. Now – yes. Now." She turns her head to him. Smiles. "Congratulations, Tim."</p><p>-</p><p>"They will not <em>talk</em>." Cassandra says as Tim rubs his temples. "None of them will talk. They do not know anything and are afraid to say something to make you think they <em>do</em>. It is not any of our people."</p><p>"If it is not one of ours, then who? Who else could get close enough to poison me?"</p><p>"The palace guard. The servants. A noble. A soldier. A trainee. Anyone who even passes the kitchens." Cassandra says, running a hand through her hair before grimacing. "You have many enemies."</p><p>"Enemies in court, yes." Tim cuts the air with his hand, "But this is <em>specific</em>. What enemies do I have that are this smart? Who have this level of cunning? This poison was targeting <em>me</em> specifically. Not you. Not the King. Not Jason. Not Talia or Damian. <em>Me</em>. It was designed in multiple stages at once. To weaken me, to make people doubt me, and to – eventually kill me after I drag the monarchy down with me while strengthening another. This speaks of plotting. Dedication. Patience. Cunning. Resources. There is no one in court who could have done this."</p><p>"And you think that one of ours helped them?"</p><p>"Yes. Cass – they would have had to know. They would have had to know that I would drink first. I <em>always drink first</em>. I have ever since I became his blade. They would know it would act upon me. It would rattle the rest of you." Tim closes his eyes. The pieces are there. "It would have to be someone close to us. Intimately close. It was <em>only in that cup</em>. Roy said that the poison was a powder. And the level of dilution must have been specific for one person. One dosage. It was a calculated attack."</p><p>"But Tim. These are <em>your servants</em>. Hand picked by you. You have never wronged them. In most cases you saved them from death or worse. You know their entire family histories going back three generations and you send their kin to school and put bread in their mouths." Cassandra says. "You have had me read them all. Twice. They would rather die than harm you on purpose."</p><p>"On <em>purpose</em>." Tim repeats. "They might not have known. They could have been under someone else's control. I did not even sense it, Cassandra. I did not even <em>realize</em>. How would we have known? For all we know, whoever it was is <em>still</em> under her control."</p><p>"Are you sure it is <em>her</em>? She is – she is supposed to be dead."</p><p>Tim laughs. "Sister. How many people who are <em>supposed</em> to be dead in our lives are <em>actually</em> dead?"</p><p>-</p><p>"I do not understand. She is yours. Why are you releasing her?"</p><p>"She is not, and never will be mine." Tim says, running his hand over the dire wolf's flank. She has grown big in these past two years. It is hard to believe that she was the runt of her would-be litter. The wolf's ice blue eye rolls up to look at him before she closes her eyes once more. Tomorrow they will part ways, but for now it is nice to be close to her once more. "She does not belong here,<em> da'mi</em>. What is of the north should stay north."</p><p>Damian wrinkles his nose, hands curled around his ankles as he watches them. It is getting late, and Tim hopes that he doesn't have to actually tell the young prince to go to bed. He would rather not suffer the boy's tantrum at being treated like a babe or the Princess' ire for indulging him. Or worse. Helena's sulk at being left out.</p><p>"Falconers do not release their falcons." Damian mutters in response. Tim is proud of him for holding back the obvious response to Tim's answer.</p><p>"And what part of this wolf reminds you of a falcon, <em>da'mi</em>?" Tim raises an eyebrow, watches the prince hunch his shoulders. "Do you remember the story I told you, when you were much younger, of how the world came to be?"</p><p>"Yes." Damian says, "The war between the first four that resulted in the children of <em>Ymir</em> rising from his spine to reclaim the frost-land."</p><p>"And what were the first thirteen?" The dire wolf's ear pricks up, and Tim runs a hand over her ruff, soothing her. Patience, Tim whispers to her with his <em>seithr</em>. Patience. He will understand in time.</p><p>"The first were the dragons. The eldest dragon that came from the depths of <em>Ymir's</em> spine shook the earth for he was too large to fly and so he became the guardian of the spine, returning to <em>Ymir's</em> bones as new-flesh. And he slumbers on and waits for his father-mother to wake." Tim nods in encouragement as Damian counts off on his fingers. The words and signs are awkward on him, but he does better than anyone else, save Jason. "Second born is the mother-dragon from the top of <em>Ymir's</em> spine who took to the skies, pushed on by <em>Ymir's</em> last breath. She circles and circles, bringing with her the clouds and frosts of <em>Ymir's</em> <em>seithr</em>."</p><p>Damian frowns in concentration – "The third and fourth dragons are twins. The brother snapped <em>Ymir's</em> eye in his jaws and flew into the sky, and his sister who came so soon after him chased him for fear of being left alone. They carry <em>Ymir's</em> eye, which closes and causes the brother-sister pair to panic and stir the dead with their moans. Fifth came the dragon of the seas, mother-father of the deep-dwellers, who was born in a rush of blood and bone. The sixth dragon was forced out of the bone by the seventh, and disappeared into the air, born too soon. The seventh followed soon after out of guilt, and together the two became the first magic of the world. The eight was born and tasted <em>Ymir's</em> tears before all things and stayed with at <em>Ymir's</em> mouth to weep with their father-mother."</p><p>Tim waits and steps in when Damian falters.</p><p>"Nine is the mother-dragon, who breathed across the land and nurtured under her wings against the rage of her siblings and the wars of the spirit, and died to give the land life. She lives in all things, the flame that guides us home. The tenth dragon sleeps in shadows, curled in <em>Ymir's</em> spine and kicks and lashes and cries, an eternal child who sends whispers through the darkness into the hearts of living things and commands the wraiths. Eleven is the ascended one who scattered <em>Ymir's</em> teeth after grinding them with his claws. He breathed fire into each and threw them into the sky to light the way home. Twelve is the wanderer who comes and goes as the winds take him, trailing after the second dragon's storms with light glistening from her scales."</p><p>"Thirteen is the giver." Damian says, as Tim nods, "Who saw the land that their kin had made and gave birth to the frost-children so that so that they may have it too."</p><p>"And it is from the thirteenth that the frost-children have their horns, eyes, and tongues." Tim says, "Now tell me, if the frost-born are of the thirteenth, where do all the other things come from?"</p><p>"The ninth, the nurturer." Damian replies. "She made all things."</p><p>"The ninth is older than the thirteenth." Tim says, "Would her creations not be older as well?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"And so, the dire-wolf, who's bone I share, is older than me." Damian blinks, mouth opening to protest. Tim holds up a hand. "We do not domesticate as you do in the south. For we, the frost-born, are the youngest sibling. Born of the thirteenth. We are the last. And so we look to our elders for guidance. We are bone-kin. They are smarter and wiser than we are, and have adapted to what we are too young to know. They are not mindless beasts, Damian."</p><p>The she-wolf raises her head and barks in agreement. Tim grins down at her.</p><p>"And that is why I did not name her." Tim says. "It was nice of your grandfather to give her to me. It was the right thing to do. But she is not property. She is herself, and someday she will choose her own name. And perhaps – if it should please her, after she goes home she will return to me one day. Perhaps she will come when she senses I need her, or perhaps she will come on my last breath. Or perhaps we will never meet again. But she is my bone-sister, and it is my duty to let her go."</p><p>The she-wolf was not meant to hunt in the sands and jungles, or to face fire and heat. She was meant for snow and ice and howling wind. She was meant for the lands of their birth. She presses her nose into his hand and Tim curls over her.</p><p>Her <em>seithr</em> is gentle as it curls around him. Fierce and loving, thankful. Pleased. Strong. Tim breathes her in, and feels their <em>seithr</em> mix.</p><p>Goodbye, Tim thinks, thank you for everything.</p><p>-</p>

</p><p>That night Tim dream-walks. It is the second time has done such a thing. But Tim knows what it is, instantly, when his dream-self sets foot down on the dry desert floor. He can taste a storm in the air, and the <em>seithr</em> of his mother-dragon.</p><p>She lands before him, a shimmering mass of ruby red and gold.</p><p>"I was ready to sear you from your bones." She says to him, molten eyes unblinking as she stands before him. In this dream, Tim is in his full frost-skin. He bows and touches the curve of his horns to the hot ground.</p><p>"I am sorry. But I did not fail."</p><p>"No." She says. "You did not fail." He feels her hot breath against him. "But you know what will happen if you do."</p><p>"Yes." Tim says, lifting his head. "But I did not. I will not. I was fooled once, and the shame lies with me. But I will not allow it a second time."</p><p>"Dragons do not forgive slights to their honor, easily." She says, stretching her wings out. Clouds gather in the sky, Tim can taste lightning beginning to build. Potential. Her tail rasps against the ground. "They do not forgive those who attack kin at all."</p><p>Tim smiles, teeth and fang and horn and claw. "<em>Ymir</em> will know vendetta. And blood will wash blood."</p><p>Mother-dragon laughs, raising her wings up as the first drops of rain begin to fall. She bows her head over him, and presses the tip of her nose to his head.</p><p>"Meet flame with frost, child of the Thirteenth Mother-Father. You are the child of winter and formed by the frost-laced wind of the north. Never forget that no matter how much the flame may melt and shape you, you are always <em>ours</em>." Tim reaches up to press his hands against her hot scales. The ruby-scales are daughters and sons of the twelfth, and for all that they are rare in the north they are some of the closest kin to the frost-born.</p><p>"Frost formed." Tim says as the sky around them cracks open, a torrent of water crashing down on their backs. It steams when it hits her scales, and he hears it crackle and freeze as it falls over his skin.</p><p>"Flame forged." She whispers as their heartbeats align, and Tim wakes. He exhales and steam rises into the night air.</p><p>In the darkness Tim can still see, and he feels the currents of <em>seithr</em> on his flesh as he turns to Ra's who lies at his side. The King sleeps on, and Tim focuses on his heartbeat. Strong and steady, slow and slumbering.</p><p>Tim closes his eyes and feels for his own. The mother-dragon's and his own. It feels heavier. Stronger.</p><p>This was both a warning and a greeting. If he should fail and shame her so terribly once more he will die for certain. Whether it is at the machinations of another or by her own flame.</p><p>It is an honor to be gifted with the <em>seithr</em> of a mother-dragon. He will not shame her. He will not bring her pain.</p><p>-</p><p>"Lies. Slander." Talia hisses, hands fisted as she slams the table. "You <em>dare</em> insult the third consort, and blade of the Crown Princess?"</p><p>"They are not lies." Tim says, looking to Cassandra for help. "Princess – I am telling you this now because I want to be certain. I need to ask you – "</p><p>"You wish to ask me if my <em>consort</em>, my <em>blade</em> is seeking to usurp my father's throne? If she is working with an outsider to overthrow the empire?" Talia's knuckles pale, and she shakes her head, "No. I do not have to listen to this. Shiva is loyal to me. She is my third. She is my <em>blade</em>. As you are my father's blade."</p><p>He holds his hands out to her, "Please. Princess. Just hear me out. Listen to my logic, and then correct me where I am wrong. I ask for you ears. Not your belief."</p><p>"It is an <em>insult</em>. If we were not in the Consort's Garden, if you were not my father's chosen – if you were not my beloved's pupil, and the favorite of his wards – I would cut your tongue out of your <em>mouth</em> for such words." She snarls. "Shiva has been at my side longer than you have been in this <em>country</em>."</p><p>"We have been looking at who could have poisoned me, Princess." Tim says, "It must have been someone close to us. Someone close to the throne."</p><p>"Servants. Guards. Nobles. Anyone could have poisoned you, frost-born."</p><p>"But it was <em>not</em> anyone." Tim presses. "It had to be someone who handles these affairs regularly. Someone – someone who would not be amiss within the Gardens of the Consort. Someone everyone is familiar with. And yes – it was a servant who did it. But where would that servant have gotten the poison? That exact dosage? Who would have known that I always drink first?"</p><p>"It is <em>common knowledge</em> that the blade drinks before the hand." Talia snaps. "Shiva always drinks before I do."</p><p>"It is <em>not</em> common knowledge. Not unless you know the function of the blade, or if you are watching." Tim says, "And what servant would know the poison? Such a rare one. Such a deadly one – that must be given in an exact dosage for it to work the way it did. Someone was pulling the strings."</p><p>"So you assume <em>Shiva</em>? Your evidence is weak, consort. And my patience wears thin at having such accusations thrown at my closest."</p><p>"The servant is dead." Tim says. "When we found out the name, we tracked him to his home. He lives outside of the palace. His entire family is dead. No struggle. A quiet assassination. None of their neighbors even knew they were dead. The bodies were old and beginning to rot. But we did see one thing that remained. A single mark left on the body. The size of a small coin, bruised and purple, just underneath the jaw."</p><p>Shiva's signature.</p><p>Talia clenches her fists, jaw tightening as she looks away.</p><p>There is no one else in the entire continent with such precision. To kill with that single touch. So quietly. It is Shiva's signature. Her pride.</p><p>"So then we turned to those related to him. We looked towards anyone who could have been related to that incident." Tim folds his hands and closes his eyes. "You have heard of these so called plagues – the fevers – that have been slowly encroaching upon us from the west and north. The rebellions from the south and east. There, too, we found signs. Entire villages wiped out. Specific targets among the south. Whisperers. Or at least – the ones known to the royal family."</p><p>Tim was never so foolish as to divulge the full scope of his network to anyone. Not the Ubu. Not to Ra's. And never on paper.</p><p>It is not possible, anyway. His network grows daily, and even he does not know its full scope anymore. His whisperers and his blood-bound kin are adept in how they recruit and distribute their forces. His is a living web. Moving and shifting around him even as  he weaves from the center.</p><p>"My whisperers all die before the rebellions can start." Tim says. "I recently sent some of my spies to villages near the rebellions. Where these so-called Imperial Guards are imposing martial law. I sent them to watch my known allies. To see the bodies. Shiva's mark is on all of them."</p><p>"She would not." Talia protests. "She is my blade." Talia's eyes stray to Cassandra and Tim feels his sister tense at his side.</p><p>"If Shiva is your blade, and I am Ra's', then Cassandra is mine." Tim says before Talia can voice her thoughts. "She agrees with me. All the signs point to your consort."</p><p>"You would accuse your mother of treason?" Talia says, eyes burning with rage and denial. "Your own flesh?"</p><p>"She may have given birth to me," Cassandra says, speaking up for the first time, "But she did not raise me. I would not call her my mother." Cassandra's dark eyes bore into Talia's. Unflinching, unyielding. "You know that."</p><p>"Princess, when you asked me – you asked me, once, before I became consort if I loved your father." Tim says, watching the princess stiffen in front of him. "Can you tell me if Shiva loves you?"</p><p>They all know the answer to that.</p><p>"She is loyal." Talia says, voice low, eyes dark. "Shiva is loyal. She has been at my side for years."</p><p>"But why is she at your side, princess? Is it because she loves you? Does she even respect you?"</p><p>Talia closes her eyes and Tim can see the hurt, the pain, the defeat – the resignation in her. She knows.</p><p>Shiva has only ever stayed at Talia's side because Talia is strong. By staying with her, Shiva could challenge a great many people. Talia was opportunity.</p><p>But Shiva does not love her. Shiva – Shiva has not truly loved any in a long time. Her love of war and violence and pain has long hardened her to anything as soft and insidious as the love of spirit.</p><p>("She lost her sister and it broke her, I think." Cassandra tells him, hands clasped together around a cup of wine. "I think her sister was her link to her heart. In a way. Losing her sister – it changed her. It made her cold. It made her forget.")</p><p>"Who else." Talia whispers. "Who would she choose over me? Who, other than me, is strong enough to be worthy of her?"</p><p>"You have a sister." Cassandra says. "And Shiva has always had a soft spot for sisters."</p><p>-</p><p>"Do you understand how lightning works?" Bruce asks him as he watches Tim carefully write out the names for stars. The work is tedious, but it is not boring. It is better than having to tally how many chickens there are for eating and how many peppers are still green. And it is cool working inside the palace, in the shelter of the stone and tile.</p><p>"<em>Seithr</em> gathers and when it is impacted in a certain way it sparks into magic." Tim says as he copies Bruce's script, writing the names for a trio of stars in as straight a line as he can. He has had to start over twice, now, and Tim is not looking forward to a third time. "The energy leaps from one point to another point, as directed by the <em>seithr</em> bridge."</p><p>Bruce is silent for a moment, and Tim wonders if this is to be another lesson. He has to admit that out of all the people who would call themselves his teachers, Bruce's lessons are the only ones that he truly pays attention to. They are interesting and necessary and are usually given to him in a way that does not make him want to scream <em>you are wrong</em> or jump a window.</p><p>Though – to be honest – if Tim <em>did</em> jump out of a window mid-lesson, Bruce would probably just follow after him. Or the guilt would make Tim come slinking back.</p><p>"That seems to follow some of the current theories." Bruce says. Tim looks up at the man. "I do not want to sound patronizing, but is there science in the north?"</p><p>"Science?"</p><p>"Yes. It is the study of how things work. And why they work. It is something like what alchemists and healers do. Much like how healers study how the body moves and how to hurt and heal it, so too do scientists study how the world works and why."</p><p>Tim wrinkles his nose. "I do not know." He was so young when he was taken. There are many things he does not know. And many things he does not know that he knows until he realizes he does. It is all very confusing. Tim carefully puts down his quill and waits for Bruce to explain.</p><p>"I ask because the lore of your people is very interesting. And in some cases it aligns with what the we have come to understand, and in some cases it does not. It would help me greatly if you could explain your mythologies to me." Bruce says. And Tim thinks he will always wonder at how someone so large and so strong could be so gentle and soft-spoken.</p><p>In many stories, this man is known as the Dark Knight. One of the fiercest warriors and champions of men in the West. He dresses the part and sometimes acts the part.</p><p>But mostly Tim knows Bruce as a scholar and a patient, understanding father.</p><p>Bruce pulls out a thick book – Tim cannot read the title. It is written in the western script. And Tim is just barely beginning to understand the inscription-pattern of these Southerners.</p><p>"Do you understand how explosives work?"</p><p>"Yes." Tim says, "I think."</p><p>"Do you know why things that are smaller will tend to combust faster?"</p><p>"Because there is more <em>seithr</em> among the little things clustered together than in one single thing. When you divide an explosive up several times, the <em>seithr</em> is multiplied. Which means that there is more <em>seithr</em> gathering and charging magic for an explosion at once." Tim answers. Bruce hums and writes something down.</p><p>"That is, again, similar to what we understand." Bruce says, "Would you tell me more?"</p><p> </p><p>-</p><p>The dire wolf pup grows quickly. Although Tim had previously thought his new quarters as the Commander and Blade to the King were quite large and spacious, she proves that wrong immediately. And much to Tim's chagrin.</p><p>"You are being spoiled, and if it were not for the fact that you terrify the livestock I would have you put in the barn or in the stables." Tim tells her when she whines and paws at him from the floor. He reaches over to pick her up by the scuff of her neck and sets her on the foot of the bed. "You are a wolf of the north, stop making that face at me."</p><p>She whines some more, curling up in a little ball of black and gray fur before going to sleep. Tim knows that when he wakes up she will be sprawled on her back between his legs or over his throat. And she will cry when he moves and wakes her up, then she will beg him for scraps of his breakfast.</p><p>And at the rate she is succeeding she will grow very fat, indeed.</p><p>Tim sends her out to the gardens most days, with the strict warning not to fight any of the more exotic creatures. Especially the ones with magic. She is too young to know how to use the powers gifted to her by <em>Ymir</em> and so far from the frost of their home they do not know what she could do. He is not entirely certain if she was born in the North or not. But she seems to know what he means, because he can feel the faint understanding of her <em>seithr</em> with his own.</p><p>His ability to sense is not as strong as it can be, and that he blames entirely on his seals and the scrutiny the council puts him under.</p><p>"Do you know your name?" Tim asks her, one of her ears flicks at him. <em>No</em>. "Do you think you will find it, here?"</p><p><em>No</em>.</p><p>"I see." Tim closes his eyes. "Is there anything I should call you?"</p><p><em>No</em>.</p><p>"As you wish it." Tim yawns, feels her starting to inch up the mattress as he drifts off. "Spoiled brat."</p><p>Her teeth nip at his toes through the blankets, before she quickly darts over his legs to settle over his stomach. He rests a hand on her back and sleeps.</p><p>-</p><p>"I thought you were gone." Tim whispers, slamming against Jason's chest, "No one – <em>no one would tell me anything</em>. You are not allowed to die. You are an idiot, what ever happens in the city <em>you, almost died</em>."</p><p>"I am sorry." Jason says after a moment, arms curling around Tim's shoulders. He feels different. Perhaps it is because of time and distance – perhaps Tim has forgotten – but he feels…<em>darker</em> somehow. Without access to his <em>seithr</em>, Tim cannot tell what exactly, has changed for certain. But something has. Jason rubs circles on Tim's back and Tim focuses in on Jason's heartbeat. "I did not exactly plan on it, you know."</p><p>"You are a fool." Tim mutters, "And I am never letting you out of my sight again, lest you get your fool head cut clean off."</p><p>Jason winces, "I am not <em>that</em> bad."</p><p>"Forgive me if confidence is lost." Tim curls his fingers into Jason's tunic and squeezes his eyes shut. "No one would tell me anything."</p><p>It has been a long – a long almost-year of worrying. But it is worth it, to have his brother home again.</p><p><em>Ymir</em> was kind.</p><p>Jason has grown taller, yet again, and he towers over everyone, now. Save Bruce. But Tim thinks that will change in time, as well. The last of his baby-fat has melted from his bones and Tim realizes that his brother has grown up when he was not looking. When he was not allowed to look. Jason ruffles Tim's hair, and Tim bats his hand away.</p><p>"I promise you, little brother," Jason says, squeezing Tim's shoulder, "It is different now. I will not fall. I will not fail." Jason flashes his teeth, "Not a second time, at least."</p><p>Tim looks into his blood-brother's eyes and sees something different. It is Jason. He is still Jason. But he is – changed. There is something dark in Jason's green eyes. Something familiar in that Tim has felt it in himself.</p><p><em>Ymir</em>.</p><p>Tim wonders if the half of Jason's flesh that knows the frost and thunder of the north has woken. If <em>Ymir</em> has made a home in Jason's bones and if the cold-rage of winter flows through his veins. He wonders if Jason now keeps the eye-less sky in his heart, and if t he winter-gales howl through his ears at night.</p><p>"Do you see?" Tim asks under his breath as he lets Jason go. "Do you feel?"</p><p>Jason tilts his head and Tim wonders if perhaps Jason is unaware of what it is that is inside of him.</p><p>Or perhaps it is not <em>Ymir</em> at all.</p><p>Tim shakes his head, squeezes Jason's wrist.</p><p>"I am – I am glad you are home, Jason." Tim says, instead. "Your presence was missed."</p><p>-</p>

  <b>-</b>
</p><p>In order to become a suitable Blade for the King, Tim has to learn many more things in addition to that which he already studies as a soldier. Animal husbandry, crop rotation, trade treaties, population control, distribution of wealth.</p><p>The North is not a nation or a country. There is no currency there, nor Kings or Councils or any such body to unite them. They are a series of steads and <em>jarls</em>, each fighting for the right to survive and eke out an existence among the other creatures of frost and snow.</p><p>They know not to fish too much by watching the <em>seithr</em> of the lakes and rivers. It is wrong to take too much from the land and to eat too much of their fellows to the point of excess. Nothing should ever be wasted. It is dishonorable to waste the body of your kill. It must be used. If not by the one who felled it, then by something else.</p><p>Trade and exporting is something that Tim has always known to be true. But production is something Tim finds completely amazing and stunning.</p><p>Farmers in a rural village will produce enough wool for themselves and then sell the excess – and they make <em>sure</em> there is excess – for metal coin. They use that coin to buy goods that they cannot make themselves, but need nonetheless. When enough people produce enough excess that means other people can use those products to make something else. Everyone covers for everyone else's lack of supplies.</p><p>And then there are people who produce nothing at all, and simply deal in the distribution or management of items.</p><p>Food is exchanged for currency, currency can be exchanged for substantial and insubstantial things. Everything has a price.</p><p>It is enough to make Tim's head ache on a good day.</p><p>Now he must master it.</p><p>In all things – be it warfare or politics, speech or magic, Tim must be perfect.</p><p>If he is to swear his life and loyalty to the service and defense of this man, Tim will make sure that he fulfills his duties with everything he is. Too many people expect him to fail.</p><p>He will <em>relish</em> in succeeding.</p><p>-</p><p>Cullen is everything Tim expects him to be – based on Harper's description and vivid recounting of their childhood in Gotham's slums – and more. He is quick, fast-fingered, and intelligent. And he is not nearly as quick to use his sharp tongue as Harper is, and that means that Tim likes him almost instantly.</p><p>Watching the two bicker back and forth is also its own form of entertainment.</p><p>"Thank you for finding my brother." Harper says, squeezing Tim's hands between her own. "Thank you. You did not have to, and I know I was asking a lot from you, but you did it."</p><p>"Family is important." Tim says, eyes drifting towards where Cullen's hand is fisted in the back of Harper's tunic. He wonders if – if he will ever have that. If he will ever get that feeling of finding what was once lost. Most likely not.</p><p>Everything burned, that day.</p><p>He wonders if perhaps he will come to find a home, here. Something to come back to, to look forward to. Something to want.</p><p>Tim thinks that he would be very lucky, indeed, if he were to find something to want in the south. Something to hold on to.</p><p>Cullen reaches out with his other hand to clasp Tim's forearm.</p><p>"I don't know how to thank you." Cullen says, "I – I did not think that I would ever. I mean. I <em>hoped</em>. But realistically – "</p><p>"It was a long year." Tim says, "Even the strongest of dreams and hopes would falter."</p><p>"We owe you a great debt, Tim. You didn't – I know. We were strangers." Harper says, "You did not have to. You have your own vendettas, but you helped me anyway. And I know – I know I was not the nicest person in the world."</p><p>Tim snorts. Cullen raises an eyebrow. Harper huffs -</p><p>"I am trying to say something nice, here. Stop judging me. Anyway – I know that at times I must have tried your patience. But you stuck with me anyway. And I just – thank you. You are a good friend. And I think, the best friend anyone could have in this entire country. I am honored."</p><p>"And I have only just met you. But I, too, think that I would be honored to name you s one of my friends, Tim." Cullen says.</p><p>He looks between them and it does not quite feel like home. Or something worth coming back to. Not yet.</p><p>But it feels like a start.</p><p>-</p><p>The insignia for the Consort's Guard, and members of the Consort's retinue was, originally, a camellia. It is…<em>cute</em>. The King's symbol is a rising phoenix. How sweet. A bird and a flower. Utterly charming.</p><p>Tim keeps that for the surface. It would probably irk people if he changed too many things too quickly. So Tim keeps the camellia. For the most part. The servants who work in the Consort's Garden still bear the symbol of the camellia on their uniforms. As do the guards.</p><p>But for <em>Tim's</em> chosen, he picks something far less obvious. The uniforms of the Consort's guards and attendants, in contrast to those of the Palace and King's, are black and gold. The pale pink camellia is a stark contrast against their arms and breasts.</p><p>To Tim's chosen, he gives them the eye of <em>Ymir</em>. Gold and stitched onto the sides of their hoods. Invisible when left down, a glaring mark when brought up.</p><p>Jason wears his proudly – Cassandra keeps hers hidden. Balance. Z, Prudence, and Owens keep their eyes hidden. And as Tim's network grows his eyes spread. Small golden eyes sewn underneath the camellia, small and unnoticeable unless you  know what to look for.</p><p>They are a secret. Not even the other consorts know the eyes. Tim tells no one, except those who bear his mark what the eye means. He weaves his own <em>seithr</em> into the thread, and a strand of his own hair.</p><p>They are <em>his</em>. His eyes, and they mean nothing to most who happen to see them on the sides of Jason's head.</p><p>"I have no horns." Jason says as he flips his hood up, "But I at least have these."</p><p>"You are ridiculous." Tim says, pressing his finger to the side of Jason's head. "They all say you have the oddest taste in fashion."</p><p>"I think you mean <em>great</em> taste." Jason snorts, securing the leather tube containing the updated maps to his back, "So. Just take this to the girls down at the lower east corner, then check in on the transport going on around the north entrance?"</p><p>"Yes. And if you can, do a sweep of the incoming slaves. See if you can find any potential."</p><p>"Got it, boss." Jason salutes before climbing out the window.</p><p>-</p><p>Tim is not sure of what he agreed to. All he knows is, is that he is in a small room with a cot and a basin of water. There is one window that looks out into a small courtyard. He is dressed in a plain tunic and breeches.</p><p>There is a boy who comes to see him. He does not look like one of the southerners, but he speaks their language. But he also speaks a bit of the northern tongue as well. Accented and rough, but Tim can understand it.</p><p>He teaches Tim the language. Slowly, a little, day by day.</p><p>His name is Jason, and Tim is in the infirmary right now. They are going to make sure he is not sick, and they will give him some sort of potion to make it so that he does not get sick from the diseases the southerners are used to. In the mean time, he has to stay here and wait.</p><p>The brands on his back itch underneath the salves that the healers applied.</p><p>The food tastes different, but it is good and the best thing he has had in <em>months</em>. Tim licks his fingers clean while Jason explains to him what an <em>army</em> is, exactly.</p><p>It is like a hunting party, Tim thinks. But they are always waiting and they do not hunt one creature, but other hunting parties. And they are many, many men strong.</p><p>And apparently the people in this army train since they are very young. Like Tim. And a lot of them are also former-slaves and former prisoners. Foreigners, as well. Tim will, perhaps, be the only one from the north, but he will not be the only one <em>not</em> of the south.</p><p>"Kin?" Tim asks him as Jason pours Tim some water. Jason hums, tilts his head.</p><p>"No. No kin."</p><p>"None?" Tim curls his toes and wonders if that means Jason is nameless like he is, then.</p><p>"Guardian." Jason replies, frowning, "Not flesh. Not blood."</p><p>Tim blinks, wrinkling his nose. Jason twists his lips, scratching his head before slowly explaining in a mix of north and southern signs -</p><p>"Took me in." Jason says, making the sign for <em>dragon's wings</em>. "Not flesh. Not blood. Understood name."</p><p>"Oh. <em>Guardian</em>." Tim repeats the word, rolling it around on his tongue. Saving it. Not flesh. Not blood. But understood to be under the same name. Tim slowly makes the sign of <em>mother-dragon</em> and <em>gift</em> – "Guardian?"</p><p>Jason nods. Smiles. "Yeah! Guardian."</p><p>"Safe?" Tim asks, shaping the bear with his left hand. Jason nods, "Warm?"</p><p>Jason laughs. "Cool. Yes. Safe. The South is really hot. Not a problem. Shade is what you want. And money. My guardian has that covered, though."</p><p>-</p><p>It should not be so hard to be both Commander and Blade to the King. But Tim finds himself torn in two different directions. And it is often hard to reconcile both functions in a way that will not diminish either of their powers.</p><p>As the Commander Tim has the protection of the people and the lives of his soldiers first and foremost in his mind. He must think on how to save their lives and ensure the least risk to their wellbeing. If battle can be stayed by word and gold rather than flesh and blood, that is the way they must choose.</p><p>He must be a presence in their lives and training. It is not fair of him to demand excellence of them and yet never show them his own skills in the training arena. Tim is only seventeen, and he, too, has much to learn.</p><p>But there is also the city guard he must manage, and how they present and go about their duties. He must sit in on their meetings and check their reports and make sure that there is no abuse in power.</p><p>Then there are the elite soldiers, who's practices Tim must occasionally attend in order to make sure they respect him.</p><p>As the Commander of the King's armies, Tim must be many places and present himself, always, as strong and in control. He is their head. Their leader. He unites them against a common enemy and gives them the tools they need to defend themselves and others from it. And if it were just that, Tim does not think it would be so hard. It is no trouble to be around the soldiers he has spent these past nine years with. Many of them are used to him by now, and those that are not are quick to learn the error of their assumptions.</p><p>Respect is not hard to earn when Tim is easily capable of defeating many of the more <em>stubborn</em> – biased, cruel, foul-mouthed, generally disliked – opposition, and when Tim has already dismissed those who have bought their ranks and bullied their way to positions of power.</p><p>If Tim was simply the Commander, Tim thinks his life would not be half as stressful and hectic as it is now.</p><p>But he is <em>not</em> just the Commander. He is also the King's Blade. And as such, Tim must also attend to his duties at the King's side. He could, Tim supposes, leave some of the more menial tasks to the Ubu. But these are his duties, and he will not delegate them to another when they have been his responsibility since the start.</p><p>Tim must know everything so that he can answer any question the King has. He is the King's guard, the blade that needs not be drawn. The Blade that lies at Ra's' left and covers his back. He must be the Blade that cautions others against violence and trickery. It is his duty to know what the King wants before he wants it, and to make sure that the King's way is clear. He must anticipate all things.</p><p>And to that extent, Tim must be there for certain key meetings. He must know the court inside and out. He must also know the movements of the people outside the city and the nobles in other cities and estates. Tim must know what happens beyond their borders as well as well as what happens within them.</p><p>Tim controls the network of whisperers that lies over the country like a web, pulling their strings and casting new nets where he sees fit. Recruiting and refining and always, always, making sure that these people are not in danger. Or <em>the</em> danger. No one must have all the knowledge. All the power.</p><p>Not even the King.</p><p>He is the blade that cuts both ways. It is his duty to tell the King when he is wrong. Or when his ventures are dangerous and foolish.</p><p>But Tim is only seventeen, and for all that he has been here for years, he is still very much a foreigner. Tim does not think that he will ever, truly, become one with this country as Jason and Cassandra and his fellows have.</p><p>He is <em>Ymir-loved</em>. Given the <em>hammrammr</em> of the <em>huldr-</em>kin and the mother-dragon. The rage and hunger of winter echo in his bones, even bound as he is to southern flesh. And his heart beats in time to the thunderfall of storms. Tim is the child of frost and thunder. His flesh and blood do not forget. His bones are dragon-kin. His flesh is frost-child. His horns are <em>Ymir-loved</em>. He will never be able to accept the flame and green-blooms of the south completely.</p><p>At night – Tim still dreams for <em>seithr</em> and <em>Ymir's</em> whisper underneath his feet. He still wakes up looking for the taste of storms in the air. His first instinct is to shape the words and <em>seithr</em> rather than speak. When he tosses his head he always startles for the lack of the weight of his horns.</p><p>Nine years is not enough to wash away what has been carved into him by forces beyond the ken of understanding.</p><p>So Tim does not think that he can be faulted when he makes mistakes. When he needs to be corrected and when he needs someone to tell him things. But <em>oh</em>, how he <em>hates</em> how that it is used against him.</p><p>It rankles and pricks at his skin, the way that nobles and council members, merchants and people who do not <em>know him</em> think that they do. How when they realize that he does not understand certain words or customs, that they can treat him like a complete foreigner and try to cheat him. Manipulate him.</p><p>Do they think him so foolish? Do they think that the King would be such a complete and utter idiot as to appoint someone who <em>could</em> be tricked and played with in such a way to such an important position? Does he look like a <em>puppet</em>?</p><p>Tim gnashes his teeth and wishes for his horns, and sends Prudence to deal with them. She is not nearly the best diplomat of his soldiers, but he would give them a taste of their own medicine. Z is too nice for them.</p><p>He has much to learn, and Tim does not think it is entirely fair – nor wise – for people to patronize him for that. Tim tells that to the King one day, as the man attempts to drill the art of inscription into his head once more. He almost admires the King for his seemingly endless patience. Tim does not have the talent for enchantment and he has set seven things on fire by complete accident already.</p><p>Or – he <em>would</em> admire the man if he did not have a feeling that Ra's was doing it entirely for his own amusement at watching Tim get angry at his own failings. If Tim ever did – by some <em>miracle</em> or divine intervention – succeed in enchanting something, Tim is fairly certain the King would be just as amused and pleased with Tim's success as his failure.</p><p>"That is another tool for you to use at your disposal, is it not?" The King says as Tim wipes soot off the table with his sleeve. "If they underestimate you, is it not all the more easier to manipulate them to do things your way? They will resist your actions and will if you try to use force. They will resent you if you use the weight of your titles. They will grow to hate you if you use deceit and trickery."</p><p>"So I am to play the fool and allow them to have their way to the detriment of the people?"</p><p>"If they think that you are a fool, they will never suspect your duplicity. Any actions you take will be of their own will, in their mind. You must plant ideas into them. Weave a subtle web, Commander, and the fly will not even know it is dead."</p><p>"That seems so troublesome." Tim sighs as Ra's pulls out another plate and a new inscription wand. Tim wonders how many spares he has. Tim has already gone through four wands this afternoon alone.</p><p>The King smiles, "But it is so incredibly <em>fun</em>, Commander. And everyone should find some pleasure in their work."</p><p>The man looks like he is nearing sixty and but Tim is fairly certain that on the inside he is firmly stuck with the mindset of a particularly vicious and mean-spirited ten year old.</p><p>Sort of like Damian. <em>Ymir</em>, the boy is going to be a second coming, isn't he. Tim is not looking forward to that. He hopes that Dick will be a good influence. And if not Dick then perhaps Jason and Cassandra's combined teasing will make sure the boy actually grows up into a half-way decent man. Who <em>does not</em> blatantly take pleasure in other people's suffering.</p>

</p><p>"I <em>thought</em> you had the one who poisoned you executed." Ra's says when Tim presents his evidence.</p><p>"I <em>thought</em> that the one who poisoned me was actually the one who poisoned me." Tim replies, "I was wrong."</p><p>The blood of an innocent man is on Tim's hands, and what bothers him most is that he thought he was right.</p><p>"He confessed."</p><p>"He lied." Cassandra had been busy at the time and was not able to see it with her own eyes. Perhaps, if she did – perhaps if she was not elsewhere, perhaps if she was not at Tim's side and tending to him, she would have seen his lies. And this entire plot would have been cracked open from the start. Tim picks at a piece of paper, "I am not sure as to why he lied. But he did."</p><p>"Blackmail."</p><p>"Possibly. He was afraid of whoever told him to lie, more than he was afraid of death." It was not loyalty that failed. But fear of something greater than pain. "Cassandra and I went to his village. They are dead."</p><p>Shiva.</p><p>"Talia is not taking it well." Ra's says, "Have you decided what must be done with her?"</p><p>"Shiva will not go down without a fight. Talia would want to speak with her, as well. It will be dangerous." Tim says. "Cassandra is willing to face off against her. But the fight will be close and victory is not certain, by any means."</p><p>If he could, he would help her, but he would probably get in the way.</p><p>"Does Shiva know?"</p><p>"She is not in the city, that we know of. And I have kept this information secret and close." Tim says by way of answer, "No one knows all of the facts except myself, Jason, and Cassandra."</p><p>"Not even me?"</p><p>"No. Not even you, my King." Tim replies, "Not yet, at least. Perhaps when it is over I will sit you down and tell it to you as a story."</p><p>Ra's shoots Tim a <em>look</em>. Tim shrugs.</p><p>"There is much to know, and too many vulnerabilities as it is. I need you to take care of the imposters setting up martial law, or otherwise rebelling in the south. This information should help you with that, and the Ubu are more than capable of managing my whisperers in that area."</p><p>"What are you planning, I wonder." Ra's sighs, pulling the papers closer to look them over. "Sometimes I think that you will tear down my empire as we stand, the way you go about things."</p><p>"I have worked too hard for it to crumble <em>now</em>." Tim says, "I will be busy managing these so called plagues and dead towns to the west and north. I am pulling in as much help as I can from others." Barbara has been especially vocal in lending her aide. At this point Tim is not sure <em>who</em> is running the efforts at the western border. But he is more than willing to cede it to her expertise.</p><p>The woman is terrifying and Tim thinks he can understand why Dick is still, absolutely and completely, in love with her after all these years.</p><p>"I am planning on flushing the system, as it were." Tim says, "There are traitors among us, my King. And there is only room for <em>one</em> web of deceit in this empire. And it is <em>mine</em>."</p><p>-</p><p>School is strange. It is new and Tim finds he does not <em>dislike</em> it as much as he thought he would. He learns – he learns a lot of things. And although he is not very good at the work yet, Tim thinks he wants to be. It is fascinating. The people of the south have so many <em>things</em>. They have <em>bathing</em> houses – and how do those work, Tim wonders? Surely not all of them rest on a natural spring. And their fountains! How do <em>those</em> work?</p><p>They have made little models of metal and stone to chart the progress of the stars and the moon and planets. And the moons of <em>those</em> planets! And you can calculate them- precisely. With equations, which are numbers and symbols and letters that Tim has never seen before.</p><p>And then there are the works of the alchemists! There are no alchemists in the north, and Tim has never heard of anyone doing the work they do. They take things like copper and steel and salt and turn them into <em>other</em> things. And they are capable of making potions and tinctures with strange and dazzling affects. There is much research behind their work, many numbers and calculations that make Tim's head spin when Jason explains it to him.</p><p>Of course – beyond that, there are the scholars who spend their days translating and rewriting and theorizing on old texts and papers from times past. Not just in their country, but in others as well. There are texts that go as far as the farthest border of the land of Edas, and texts from the depths of the southern seas. There are even, much to Tim's surprise and mild horror, blood-books of long gone northern steads.</p><p>(That a stead would ever part with their book is unthinkable. He wonders how they got their hands on it. And then decides that, perhaps, it is better if he does not think on it.)</p><p>There are entire classes for understanding how bone is moved by muscle and how blood flows. At first, Tim is a little afraid of the anatomical models that Jason shows him. It is unnatural to see so much, to do such things to the dead. But Tim thinks he can understand why they do it. They know how to set bone and where to cut so a limb's death does not destroy everything. They know the placement of organs and where to touch to relieve and bring pain.</p><p>Tim is eager to start this <em>school</em> and learn all these things. But Tim is – he is disappointed, in a way. His teachers do not like his questions, and often strike his hands with a long wooden strip when he tries to ask too many. His questions are not important, and Tim takes that to mean that either they do not know the answers or do not think he deserves them.</p><p>He learns a lot of interesting things, and he gets closer to his new friends. Tim feels like he is not being left behind. In fact he is better with numbers than Prudence and quickly catching up to Owens' level in science. He is behind both Z and Jason by leagues, but the gap grows shorter every day. Especially with how Jason tutors Tim during training and points all sorts of things out to him whenever he can.</p><p>Jason would make an excellent teacher. He is patient and makes things interesting. And when he does not know something he admits it and goes to find the answer so that he can tell Tim, later. Tim wishes Jason could teach him <em>all</em> his lessons.</p><p>-</p><p>There are an endless amount of divides between the sexes in these countries. Not just the Empire of the Immortal King, but in the western kingdoms and the Southern Isles as well.</p><p>It is not as – it is not as clear in the Empire. Not like it seems to be in the west, according to Jason and Dick's recounting. Barbara had to struggle and claw her way to her position.</p><p>Here, the divides are there. But subtler. It is in the connotations, Tim thinks.</p><p>They divide everything, though.</p><p>Certain colors are feminine – purple, pink, and the palest blues and whites. Masculine colors are reds, golds, deep greens.</p><p>Warfare is divided as well. Women are assassins. Masters of espionage, silence, trickery, deceit and poisons. They are the healers, the apothecaries, the herbalists. The mages. But <em>men</em> are the soldiers. The ones who bear the uniform in the sun with swords and bows and arrows and axes and flails. They are the alchemists, the scholars, the healing-mages. It is an odd divide that Tim has a hard time comprehending. It only gets worse when court matters are brought into the mix.</p><p>Both are trained in the army, but later on they are divided into different schools.</p><p>Women are the whisperers, the ones who control the flow of knowledge and keep tight the power of the purse strings. If you wish something done quietly, carefully, you ask a lady. If you want information on the smallest workings of a house, the tiniest detail down to a stitch – the weakest point, the strongest point, the best point to strike, the worst, you ask a lady.</p><p>And if you want something done loudly, boldly, defiantly. You go to a lord. They know how to prick another's pride, and how to grind someone into the dirt with sheer brutality. With words and actions. They are a blunt instrument. Weight rather than finesse.</p><p>Both are tools that Tim uses with equal caution. They are both greedy in recompense and dangerous if slighted.</p><p>In a sense Tim thinks that these divisions are better, softer, than they are in his land. Certain things are meant <em>only</em> for women in the north. Certain things are meant only for men. Here a woman or man can be either. It is true that they will face taunts and rumors for it, a blackened reputation. But in the north they would be killed.</p><p>The Empire is forgiving.</p><p>The truest divides that Tim has noticed are those between the rich and the poor. It is a wide and vast gap that only becomes more noticeable the further you venture in the city.</p><p>The poorest districts are on the outskirts, near the city walls. A series of houses built on top of each other and thin, winding streets and stairs that are cobbled together from mis-matched wood and stone and dirt. A series of pathways and tunnels that reach towards the sky on crooked and shaking foundations. Lines of clothing hang on sagging ropes between buildings, and the few gardens in the area are tangled messes that leak and bleed over building edges. It is a wild place.</p><p>It is a dangerous place. But not any more dangerous than any other part of the city. Perhaps more blatant in its dangers.</p><p>There are more entrances to the underground in this part of the city than anywhere else. Constantly shifting and moving, new ones appearing as old ones shut down. The underground trade is part of the daily life, here. People of all different countries are here. Tim sees many people of different colors and dress in that area.</p><p>They are kind to him. They see his eyes and they know him and his people well. Blood is truly thicker than water.</p><p>As you climb higher into the city and reach the mid-level terraces, you find the middle class and market areas. Bazaars, gardens, shop buildings, bath houses, schools – it is an ideal place. Tim ignores it almost entirely.</p><p>The people who live there live in a dream. Unaffected by the troubles of either the rich or the poor, the foreign or the not. They have their own troubles that they keep to themselves and resolve on their own. It is rare that a petition comes from them. Tim keeps ears there, but nothing ever truly stirs into something worth his troubles.</p><p>Tim envies them their peace. They are easy to buy – with actions or with words or with money. They are easy to keep, as well. They love him for his uniform and his title. Tim makes few appearances in that area. They all adore him anyway. Tim thinks it would take something truly grievous, indeed, for them to take arms and rise.</p><p>Their homes are uniform, their streets are neat. Their language is uniform – unmarked by the dialects that litter the larger and more varied lower districts, or the high language of the rich – and a steady blend of everything that passes through the city.</p><p>Tim thinks that if he were not part of the royal family, if he were not the King's Commander and Blade, he would wish to live there. It is quiet.</p><p>It is the rich districts, clustered close and around the palace, that give him a head ache. There are few gates to the underground here, but they are <em>open</em> and permanent. Everyone knows they are there but they are treated like they are secret and ignored. The double standard makes Tim want to hit his head against a wall. They cry out for decrease in crime and underground trade but guard their own entrances to it with as much gold as their coffers hold.</p><p>The richer districts are smaller in size, but so grand and full of so much wealth it makes Tim sick. The gardens are large, vast, and beautiful. Full of exotic and absolutely useless things. The markets are just as full of overpriced nonsensical goods. And the schools are full of pretentious whining babies.</p><p>Tim <em>hates</em> going to that district. But he must at least pretend like he cares. It is not that all the people there are bad. just that most are biased, and more inclined to using their inroads with the court to solve their problems through manipulation and trickery. They want too much power and control, and are likely to see his soldiers and himself as pawns to be waved aside or bought.</p><p>They do not <em>listen</em>. And nothing Tim can do will <em>make</em> them.</p><p>It is here where his whisperers are needed most. The rich are constantly scheming, against each other and against the royal house for one thing or another. Good intentions or not. Tim has few whisperers in these areas, and they are constantly sending him messages. It is hard to parse the ones of true threat from the ones that will die out in time or cancel each other out. It would probably be amusing to watch if he were not in the midst of it.</p><p>He, too, must play their game.</p><p>"You enjoy my pain. Your city is a wreck and I think you did this on purpose." Tim snaps as he stares at the ever growing pile of missives on his desk. "Why are you not in your own study?"</p><p>"Yours is quiet and no one would dare come in for fear of facing your wrath, Commander." Ra's answers from where he's lounging on the pillows Jason and Dick have been gradually accumulating in Tim's office. The <em>point</em> of not having any was that Tim would not be encouraging visitors to stay, Tim thinks to himself. "Sadly that is not so in my own. People come and go and it is rather irritating."</p><p>Tim snatches some of the reports out of Ra's' hand, "And so you invite yourself into <em>mine</em> and start reading through my messages? At least bring your own work if you are going to hide in here."</p><p>"I am not hiding, I am resting. It would not do if I were to suddenly snap and react – in an unsavory way towards the court due to stress. Now would it?" Ra's hums, "And I do want to remain informed on your work, you realize."</p><p>"And that is why I <em>report</em> to you about it after I have read it."</p><p>"I merely wanted to make sure you were not lying to me. Or perhaps softening your words."</p><p>"Since when did I soften my words?"</p><p>-</p><p>"Ah, and so this is the new little pet to the royal house." The woman says. Tim is uncertain about who she is. She is not a guard nor a servant. Perhaps she is a lady of a noble house. Jason had gone to fetch their dinner while Tim helped the other novices put away training gear. "What a sweet little puppet you are looking to be."</p><p>Tim does not quite understand what she means. But he is no <em>pet</em>, and Tim can't help the instinctive reaction to bare his teeth at her. She laughs, dark eyes dancing as she leans against the wall.</p><p>"What little teeth you have, little-beast. And such a fine face. You will grow up to be quite the handsome one, won't you?" Tim feels something prickle in his belly. Something cold and nervous. The other novices went on ahead. Tim wishes that he had asked them to stay. She tilts her head and leans forward, "I could just <em>eat you</em>."</p><p>"Lady Shiva." Tim turns around when he hears Bruce's voice. The man is a tall, imposing figure in the shadows. "I did not know that you had returned to the city."</p><p>Tim looks between them, and it is so hard to breathe. He does not know  how the consorts get along. He thinks that if he were in their position he would be jealous of the other. Tim knows that Bruce and Selina were lovers before becoming Talia's consorts, and are not jealous with Talia's affections. But Shiva – this one, is different. Tim thinks that there is something else between them. He wonders if it will be alright to ask Jason about it, later.</p><p>"And that is the way I like it." Shiva replies, pushing off the wall. Tim freezes as she moves forward, hand resting on his shoulder, fingers moving to curl around his neck. Her thumb slips underneath the collar of his tunic, pressing against the bone. She smiles at him.</p><p>Tim feels his heart start to pick up, and he sees Bruce move forward out of the shadows.</p><p>"Come here, Tim." Bruce says, eyes fixed on Shiva's face. Shiva's nails dig into Tim's skin before he pulls himself out of her grasp and moves to stand at Bruce's side. Shiva's eyes are laughing at him when he looks. "Why don't you go find Jason, Tim. It is time for the evening meal. You do not want Jason to eat your share."</p><p>It is not a question.</p><p>Tim runs into the palace, and does not look back.</p><p>-</p>

</p><p>"It is done." Cassandra says, Tim opens his eyes and sees the strange stillness of her <em>seithr</em>.</p><p>"Are you going to be alright?" Tim says as she kneels before him, hand a fist over her heart. She is not fine now. No one could be alright after doing what she had to do. No matter how distant the two were, Shiva – in the end, was still Cassandra's flesh. Her mentor. Tim holds his arms open for her, and she raises dry eyes to meet his before meeting him in her hard grip. She is very still as she presses her face into his neck.</p><p>"She was proud of me." Cassandra says. "And told me that I had become a fine blade."</p><p>Tim cannot grasp her, not with the hard shell of her armor over her back. It feels as if she is so far away. Slipping. Tim squeezes her closer, breathes in her sweat and that strange smell of heat that never seems to leave anyone's skin. The sun soaking into their very <em>seithr</em>. And he can -</p><p>"You smell of the Lazarus." Tim says.</p><p>"I found her there. Amidst the chaos. She was there. Waiting for me. She knew. I think. Little brother. I think she did it on purpose. Let us find her. She wanted – She wanted me to kill her."</p><p>Tim's insides clench.</p><p>"And we played right into her hands. I – I am not sorry, sister." Tim says. And he knows that she will understand. They had to do what must be done. Shiva was a threat. Loose and not altogether – <em>here</em>. Tim regrets making Cassandra be the one to do it. He regrets that in the end Shiva was not  repentant.</p><p>(There is no <em>regret</em> in the north. Tim thinks that it is an emotion that he has been taught by his blood in these lands of the sun. By Dick and Cassandra. Selina. Harper and Cullen. Barbara. Roy.)</p><p>Cassandra lets out a rattling breath against his skin.</p><p>"We fought. I was scared. I did not – I did not want to kill her. I know that I said I was ready. I know that I said that I would do what must be done. But I did not want to. Tim, I do not want to be her. I could not do it. Not truly."</p><p>Tim waits and he listens. Cass stops and starts, but eventually gets the words out. His sister has always struggled with words when actions could serve.</p><p>She tells him of how she traced Shiva to the Lazarus pit. And how Shiva wanted Cassandra to kill her. That it would be a full circle. How it would complete her training. And that if she failed – then. Then Shiva would simply start over elsewhere. Restart the entire process.</p><p>Shiva wanted to create her death. It would be her ultimate challenge. Defeated by her own flesh.</p><p>Cassandra hanged Shiva over the Lazarus pit, a sacrifice to the flame. Whether the woman eventually is revived by the flame or not is out of their hands. But Shiva is not truly dead.</p><p>"Did I do the right thing?" She asks, forehead digging against Tim's shoulder. Tim looks up and sees Jason leaning against the door. Tim waves him in.</p><p>Jason falls next to them and pulls them both into his arms. Cassandra stiffens for a moment.</p><p>"You did what you had to do to survive." Jason says.</p><p>"You did what you had to, to protect us. To come back." Tim adds on. "And no one will condemn you for that."</p><p>Cassandra does not cry. But her breathing sounds like she is on the edge of it. They sit there for a long time, holding on to one another. She says only one word.</p><p>"<em>Mother</em>."</p><p>Jason and Tim say nothing at all.</p><p>-</p><p>Damian is a spiteful little creature. And Tim looks forward to the day when he can trip the boy onto his scowling face and not get into trouble for it. Training. Tim will call it training. But for now -</p><p>"I will throw him into a pond. And I will make sure it is full of muck and smells. I would not even try to make it look like an accident." Tim says as Jason inspects the neat bite on Tim's wrist. "The <em>brat</em>."</p><p>"Just be glad that he isn't setting things on fire anymore." Jason says. "When did he even get close enough to bite you?"</p><p>"The brat is good at that." Tim would be impressed at his ability to sneak up on him, if it were not for the fact that the boy uses his talents to drive Tim insane. "What did I ever do to him, anyway?"</p><p>"You are the King's blade, and the Commander of his armies. And Bruce's star pupil. He wants to challenge you."</p><p>"He is <em>eight."</em></p><p>"He has the blood of the King, Princess, and Bruce in him." Jason snorts. Tim sighs.</p><p>"Point taken. Still. Why is he not challenging <em>you</em>. Or Cass."</p><p>"Dunno. You are the one closest to him in age, I suppose." Jason replies, shrugging. "For all we know he could be working his way up the age ladder."</p><p>"Terrific." Tim rolls his eyes, "If that brat tries to ambush me one more time, I promise nothing. When does he even begin proper training with the rest of the recruits, anyway?"</p><p>Tim can't wait for the boy to get beat in a match. Learn some <em>humility</em>. Maybe then the boy will stop trying to attack him.</p><p>"Talia has convinced the King that it would be beset if he trained in private with select tutors." Jason says, "He is not entering the formal military until later."</p><p>"Ridiculous. The brat is just going to get more spoiled."</p><p>"And that is why it is our duty, as his elders, to beat some sense into his head and make sure he does not stay the little brat he is now."</p><p>-</p><p>They say that the daughter of the Third Consort of the Princess is able to read minds, that she knows the hearts of men with a glance, and that she is all knowing of all things. No secrets can be held from her.</p><p>The idea that someone can immediately know everything there is to know scares him. That this girl will look at him and see – see something. Tim does not know what she will see. But it scares him, the idea of a stranger knowing him so well against his will.</p><p>Jason introduces him to her. "She is not so bad. The rumors – the rumors are exaggerated."</p><p>Cassandra is four years older than him – the same age as Rose would be. Tim feels a dull pang of longing for the older girl. He has no idea if they survived or were slain or sold as well.</p><p>She looks at him with dark eyes, and there are a few faint freckles on the sides of her cheeks. Her dark hair falls and curls around her face, bangs shadowing her face. Cassandra looks at him, tilting her head. Tim looks back at her. He wonders what she sees.</p><p>Does she see his southern skin, or his true self? How much does she see? Does she see the blood on his hands, the world he has lost, the empty space inside of him?</p><p>Tim holds out his hand to her, and she looks between him and Jason before grasping it. There are hard callouses on her hands, and Tim can see faint scars on her fingers. Her arms are covered in bandages, and her feet are bare and covered in dirt and scratches.</p><p>It does not match her fine clothes, which are skewed and unsettled.</p><p>"Cass is one of the best fighters." Jason says, "She is not a soldier, but she can beat any of our instructors. Even Bruce, I wager. If she wanted to."</p><p>Cass rolls her eyes, punches Jason's shoulder and walks away. Jason yelps -</p><p>"See. Not so bad." Jason says. Tim does not know. "She likes you."</p><p>Tim raises his eyebrow. "Does she?"</p><p>"Yeah. She's kind of like Bruce. Doesn't use her words and until you get to know her she's hard to read." Jason shrugs. "But trust me. As someone who <em>does</em> know her – she likes you. She thinks you're pretty nice. I've talked to her about you before. You and her are a lot a like in some ways. That is why I think you two will get along so well."</p><p>"If you think so." Tim says. Though he wonders if he will ever be able to see her again. Cassandra is notorious for disappearing into thin air and being impossible to find when she does not wish to be seen.</p><p>"She'll go to you." Jason says. "You know things she doesn't. Besides, you are good at fighting and she will most likely want to try out her skills against yours. She has never been to the north before."</p><p>-</p><p>Tim fidgets, and he can feel Ra's' growing amusement from behind him. The man has not moved from where he is meditating in the soft sunlight, but Tim <em>knows</em> the man is laughing at him.</p><p>Ra's has given him <em>homework</em> to study. A huge tome filled with nothing but spells and magic theory that have been driving Tim insane with the way they go about things.</p><p>It is all so convoluted and unnecessary and Tim does not think he will ever have the patience to go through the endless amount of steps these people have deemed necessary for the simplest of tasks.</p><p>And it is such a beautiful day, as well. It is not too hot, and there are low clouds in the sky that speak of a light drizzle. Tim wants to be out there, training or playing with one of the animals. Not inside reading outdated and <em>wrong</em> theory. Tim sighs and flips a page. He is certain that Ra's is going to test him on it later and that every wrong answer is going to end terribly for him.</p><p>Whether the man is going to tease him about it, or worse, lecture him on it, Tim does not want to know.</p><p>"I am not even a mage." Tim mutters, "I do not understand why you are so insistent on making me learn this. Can we not just agree that we will never agree on this?"</p><p>"It is important to be well rounded." Ra's replies, when Tim turns around the man looks like he has not move at all. He looks like a center of tranquility.</p><p>Which is, of course, complete and utter <em>shit</em>.</p><p>"Well rounded." Tim snorts, turning back to the page. He is only a fourth of the way through and he keeps getting stuck on the portion about the magical script. The circles just make him dizzy when he stares too long. He has no idea how these people can possibly divine meaning from them. They just look pretty. There is so much interpretation involved that Tim marvels at how people can understand the so readily. "It just does not make sense to me."</p><p>"So you are giving up?"</p><p>"There are some battles that you just cannot fight. For example, I would hardly throw you into <em>Ymir's</em> well and expect you to come out intact."</p><p>"Then you severely underestimate me. And I do believe you are exaggerating. I am simply asking you to read."</p><p>"My mind is not meant to think in this way. Just like your mind is incapable of understanding anything other than the fact that you think you are a gift to the common masses."</p><p>-</p><p>Tim watches the line of Ra's' shoulders moves as he methodically works through sword techniques. The sun has barely breached the sky, and it is eerily quiet. Tim can hear the servants moving, getting ready for the day – the sound of water bubbling in the fountain. The birds and other creatures of the gardens are silent. Even the air is still.</p><p>He watches, and waits.</p><p>A storm is coming.</p><p>"Nyssa was my favorite." Ra's says after a moment, slowly lowering his sword. Tim cannot see his face. "Her mother was never of my house. She was from a distant country, who I met while traveling and securing the borders of this empire."</p><p>A mistress. A child born out of wed-lock.</p><p>"She came to me. After." Ra's continues. Tim can hear something like longing in Ra's' voice. "She was so strong, my blade. Strong. Intelligent. Quick. So faithful. Passionate. Perfect. She was with me for so long –  she even learned to master the Lazarus flame." Pride. Tim bites his cheek.</p><p>"I thought it drove her mad."</p><p>"In a way. Perhaps it did." Ra's raises his sword to the light, examining it. "She left me. I thought she would, in time, return to resume her place at my side. I thought that – if I perhaps gave her time, she would eventually come back to me. Come home. She had many children. She built a life far from my reach. I did not begrudge her that. It is her right."</p><p>But you missed her all the same. You wished she could have had that and still been yours.</p><p>"Then one day I received a missive from her. Nyssa had always been talented in the art of dreams and astral projections. She sent her spirit to me and begged me to save her. To save her children. Her grandchildren. They were in war. And she needed the pit. But it was not my war. I could not afford to declare war on a distant nation – not at that time. My empire was not always this strong. I had my own troubles here. Once more – to demand the use of our household flame for those who are not of our lands. For those whom I have never seen with my own eyes. For those who have never learned the ways of our flames. You have been in the pit, you remember what it was like. The hate."</p><p>Tim shivers. "Your flame would have eaten me alive if I did not have the gift of being <em>Ymir-loved</em>."</p><p>The Lazarus hates. It devours and hates all things. It respects none but Ra's.</p><p>"The only reason you survived is because of how long you have spent at my side. Because of how much you are important to me. Your title as my blade, my consort, is perhaps the only reason why the Lazarus did not turn you to ash. Because I need you, it believes your must live. The Lazarus flame is harsh in its judgment of potential, and I have lost many children to its wrath." Ra's lowers his blade, other hand resting on the scabbard at his hip. "Her children would have either burned before her eyes or turned into monsters."</p><p>Tim clenches his fists. He can still feel the Lazarus flame's ghost within him. A whisper in the stillness, in dark and in light.</p><p>"There were too many risks." Tim pulls his legs underneath himself. The Lazarus pit changes something. Taking the flame – it takes and replaces it with something dark. Something wrathful. Still – there are some days where Tim cannot believe that Jason and he have survived it and remain so unaffected.</p><p>There are some days when Tim <em>knows</em> that Jason wonders at it. There is a look he gets in his eyes. A certain sharpness to his mouth and a brightness to his eyes that speaks of the Lazarus' influence.</p><p>They are not themselves any longer.</p><p>"I told her no." Ra's says, sheathing his sword with a soft <em>click</em>. "And now she comes home. As I had always wished. But to burn everything I have built to the ground because of that."</p><p>"You wished for her to be your blade."</p><p>"You are my blade." Ra's says, slightly turning his head. Tim shrugs.</p><p>"But you had always wished for it to be her."</p><p>"I had hoped." Ra's admits. "Do you know why the Lazarus called to you, seeped through the earth and reached for you?"</p><p>"No." Tim did not even know it was possible.</p><p>"The Lazarus flame is a proud flame. It is – some days I am uncertain. Perhaps the Lazarus and I are more one than I thought. Perhaps every time I use it, we combine a little more. The Lazarus is proud and easily slighted. It is all knowing and all powerful. But it has no wishes of its own, no true ability to feel or think as we do."</p><p>"Primeval." Tim says. Like <em>Ymir</em>.</p><p>"Yes. Proprietary, childish – in a sense –, easy to anger, harder to soothe once enraged. When Nyssa left – the Lazarus felt betrayed. At that time, I had hoped. I had hoped that she would return and that the Lazarus would forgive her. But I knew. She did not return and she did not – she never understood the flame as I did. She did not understand that the Lazarus' love for her could so easily turn to hate, for all that I have always told her to tread with caution. Perhaps the Lazarus saw her power in you, her influence. And the Lazarus would never allow for the one who cast it aside to lay hands on one who serves its ultimate master."</p><p>"The Lazarus cleansed me out of spite." Tim can't help the incredulous laugh. "How petty. Just like you."</p><p>"If she ever steps foot in the palace – the city – the Lazarus will destroy her." Ra's turns to Tim. "Eat her alive and make her suffer. And for all the things she has done to me, she is still my daughter. I would not have that happen."</p><p>Tim raises his hand to Ra's, beckoning him close.</p><p>"Then close your eyes and close your ears, my King." Tim says as Ra's takes his hand. "And mourn her. For she is already dead."</p><p>-</p><p>"So it is true." Tim says, when he sees Ra's in his armor, standing in the inner courtyard of the Consort's Garden. "You are leaving the city." You are leaving <em>me</em>.</p><p>"And you are staying." Ra's says, back facing Tim. "So put down your blade."</p><p>"I have never, and will never, surrender my weapons. You will pry them from my dead hands." Tim snaps. "But you – <em>you</em>. I cannot. You are leaving me <em>here</em>? That is – that is one of the most stupid, foolish decisions you could possibly make."</p><p>"It is the wisest one in current circumstances." Ra's turns, face flickering with pleasure and sadness, "Your armor does suit you so, barbarian. It is a fascinating juxtaposition. Your horns and your eyes and your skin against the pattern and cut of your garb. It is – it is a sight that I did not realize I have missed until now. It suits you more than the garb you wear as consort."</p><p>"Do not try to change the subject on me or appeal to my emotions." Tim snaps, striking the tip of his scabbard against the ground. "Do not throw words you know that in any other situation would please me in order to pacify me. I am tired of being pacified. Tell me your reasoning. Tell me why you are being so – so uncharacteristically reckless."</p><p>"I am the King." Ra's' eyes flash. "Do not question me."</p><p>"You <em>are the King</em>. I am your <em>blade</em>. Your <em>consort</em>. It is my <em>duty to question you</em>." Tim snarls. "It is the purpose to which I have been trained. It is the reason you <em>chose</em> me. And I will question you as loudly as possible in the eyes of the entire world. When I was not-myself you were disappointed. Everyone was upset. And now <em>you</em> are not being like yourself and I am to believe that everyone is just – just <em>allowing this</em>? No. I refuse. I go with you. I will ride to face Nyssa with you."</p><p>"No. I said <em>no. And you shall not sway me</em>." Ra's says, turning away again. "Your place, my blade, is where I say it is. And I say that it is <em>here</em>."</p>

</p><p>"I am your <em>blade</em>." Tim yells, "My <em>place</em> is at your <em>side</em>. Of everyone here – I have a right to face her for what she has done to me. To <em>us</em>. Is it not my duty – as your blade – to strike? To defend?"</p><p>"Yes. But not in this." Ra's says, hand resting on Tim's shoulder. "In this, you are my most beloved consort. And I will not risk you more than I already have. This is between Nyssa and myself, my blade. It is – it is a personal matter that I must attend to."</p><p>Tim's hands curl into fists – and it has been over a year since he was last in full armor, and the feeling should be reassuring. After all, Tim has always felt most comfortable in the garb of war and battle. It is in his blood. It is in his horns. It is in his <em>bone</em>.</p><p>His people were born out of war and love. His entire <em>country</em> was born out of legends of love, loss, and bloodshed.</p><p>This is what he was <em>born to do</em>.</p><p>And Ra's tells him <em>no</em>.</p><p>"We are equals." Tim says, reaching out to grasp at Ra's' arm, "I am your husband. We are <em>partners</em>. Do you – do you not think I could beat her?"</p><p>Ra's eyes flash, hard and something that Tim cannot place before it is gone -</p><p>"No."</p><p>The word is like a strike to the face, and Tim feels his expression slip for a moment. Just for a moment, before hot anger and bitterness surge inside. It tastes like something foul, and Tim knows that the Lazarus' influence is strong over him. He has grown to find that the Lazarus is prone to reacting to certain people in certain ways.</p><p>To Tim, who Ra's values highly, who Ra's has chosen over all, the Lazarus loves and hates him. But most of all, as someone who has been harmed by Nyssa's love-hate. the Lazarus has made a home in his thirst for vendetta.</p><p>Ra's catches Tim's face in his hands before Tim can turn around and find somewhere to scream and insult the man in peace. His eyes flash the brilliant poison green of the Lazarus, and his fingers dig into Tim's flesh.</p><p>"<em>No.</em>" Ra's repeats. "It is not that you are – it is not that you are less than her in my eyes. It is not. Nyssa is far older than you, my blade. She is older. Wiser. Stronger. Faster. She knows things which you do not, she has powers which you are incapable of using." Tim winces – and he supposes that perhaps this is why Ra's was so insistent on Tim studying theory – "She knows me very well, beloved one. I no longer know her mind or her heart. She will do anything to hurt me. She has already struck at you and I would not – I would not risk you going into combat with her when you are so outmatched." Ra's' thumbs glide over Tim's cheeks and his eyes soften. "Most beloved. You have already won. You are my blade. My consort. My equal. You need not prove yourself any further."</p><p>"It is not about proving myself." Tim says. And – in truth, only a very small part of himself wanted to face off against her. A small, foolish part. He knows that this <em>Nyssa</em> is dangerous. He knows that. "It is my <em>duty</em>."</p><p>"You are my heart. You are my equal. My blade." Ra's' <em>seithr</em> glows warm with pride. "I have watched over you for so long. I have watched you grow and learn and develop into the fascinating young man that stands before me."</p><p>Tim leans into Ra's' touch. And he – he does not like where this little speech of Ra's' is going.</p><p>It is <em>not like him</em>. It is not like him at all to be so forthcoming with his words. So honest. So honest when the truth he is trying to convey are like this. He can find no barbs, no tricks, no mocking laughter in any of it.</p><p>It is not like his King.</p><p>And it scares him.</p><p>Tim curls his fingers around Ra's' wrists, squeezes until he feels the creak of Ra's' armor.</p><p>"You have not been at my side for very long." Ra's says, "But in the time that you have been you have served me well. You are – you are the best blade I could have ever wielded. You have surpassed everyone's expectations, mine especially. And it is not very easy to surprise me, beloved one." Ra's leans his forehead against Tim's. A hot point of pressure as his voice slips into the high tongue.</p><p>"My King?"</p><p>"Nyssa is the strongest of all my children. The one who is most lost to me. The one who is most like I am." Ra's says, grip tightening once more.</p><p>"And that is why I should face her with mine." Tim says. "I would not be so foolish as to go alone. My coterie and I – my blood, we would be able to manage it somehow. There is no sense in putting you in harms way."</p><p>"And she would slay you all. No. It is a useless waste of flesh." Ra's says. "I would not only lose you, but I would lose your brothers and sisters. No. Your place is here. The Consort's Garden has many magical properties, laid into the earth itself and powered by the Lazarus. You will be safe here. And when it is over – " Ra's sighs. "You know how my empire works. You know the networks and systems inside and out, and how to manipulate them to your will. The people adore you. The nobles would never dare cross you. And the Lazarus would support you. The armies and whisperers wait for your words."</p><p>Ra's pulls back to look Tim in the eye.</p><p>"Your duty, as my equal, my consort, and my blade, is <em>here</em>." Ra's says, and the pit of Tim's stomach drops open. "If I should fall. The empire needs a ruler. It needs its <em>jarl</em>." Ra's presses his dry lips against Tim's forehead, between his horns. "They will need you, Timothy to show them what you do best. To lead them and guide them. My blade, my heart. Teach our people to survive."</p><p>-</p><p>"I would have thought that you of all people would understand my actions." Shiva says. Jason stands in front of him, and Tim's pride rankles at that, but at the moment he is still healing. The advanced magic of the Lazarus and <em>Ymir</em> are still settling, and it has left his skin soft and sensitive to the touch. He is no position to fight. She knows it. "You are born of a race of fighters, High Consort. It is in your blood."</p><p>"Senseless violence is not part of me." Tim snaps. "You know nothing of my people."</p><p>"Do your people not war at all times? Always striving for something greater, for proof of strength and greatness? Bowing only to those worthy of power?"</p><p>"Life is important. We do not kill when we can spare our blades. We do not hunt our own for sport. When we give our word we keep to it. No death is meaningless, all deaths are mourned." Tim says. "You have killed dozens – <em>hundreds</em> – made many more invalid. You have betrayed your Princess. The empire."</p><p>"Talia is weak." Shiva curls her lip, "I came here for a fight. I did not come here for love or money. I came here because I was under the impression that I would find worthy opponents. And I did. I found some very <em>interesting</em> battles, indeed, little pet of the King." Shiva smiles. "Take care of Cassandra, Timothy. She will be good for you, I should think."</p><p>Shiva smiles like she's ready to kill, and Tim feels Jason tense in front of him. But she is gone. And Tim knows that they will not find her until she is ready to strike. Until she is ready to return to finish what she has helped to start.</p><p>The guards are most likely dead. Tim knows this without looking. Tim closes his eyes.</p><p>"Send for Ra's." Tim tells Jason, brushing his hand over Jason's back. "And tell – have Bruce tell Talia about this."</p><p>"And Cass?"</p><p>"She already knows." Tim says, resting a hand against his forehead as one of the hidden doors swings open. Jason swears, slamming his fist against the wall. Cassandra's face is blank as she looks at them.</p><p>"Should I have pursued her?"</p><p>"No. I – I do not think it was time." Tim says. She reaches out and squeezes Jason's wrist. "Go. Clean up whatever mess has been made. Tell their loved ones. Set things up. It is – there are people to mourn. And Shiva is not one of them."</p><p>Jason leaves and Cassandra looks at him for a moment before disappearing after him.</p><p>Tim digs his teeth into his lower lip.</p><p>He wonders if it is truly <em>war</em> if the people they are going to be fighting are their own.</p><p>-</p><p>"I – are you truly sent here by my sister?" Cullen asks, wide eyed even as he stuffs his face with the food Tim snuck out of the kitchens. Tim nods. "I. She is here? In this city? She is – she is alive and well? Is she free? Safe?"</p><p>"She is safe and free. She has escaped notice and works running errands for a baker in the lower Jade district." Tim says, holding out his waterskin, "She has been looking for you."</p><p>"The Gods are with us." Cullen sighs, "I had hoped – I had hoped to find her if I made my way to the capital. I did not think she would find me first."</p><p>"Harper is contradictory like that." Tim shrugs. "Come. I will take you to her – "</p><p>Cullen's eyes flash with excitement before shuttering. "I – I want to go to her, truly I do. But. I cannot leave these people as they are now. They rely on me to gather information for them and be on the look out. I cannot leave them blind, as it were. I must help them."</p><p>If Tim had any doubts as to whether Cullen were Harper's brother or not before now, they are gone.</p><p>"You are just like your sister." Tim says, "I will try to help them as well. Where are they going and why are they hiding? If we work together I am certain that we can move them somewhere closer to Harper so you can be near her as well. And with any luck, perhaps I can add them to my network and find enough room in the safe areas for them."</p><p>-</p><p>"Ah. Bone-sister." Rose says when she sees the dire wolf for the first time. The wolf's ears perk up before she wags her tail once and puts her head back down on her paws. "You are far from home."</p><p>Rose scratches between the dire wolf's ears, before turning to Tim.</p><p>"She was a gift." Tim says, "I am watching her until she is ready to make the journey north."</p><p>"I would accompany her if she would wish it." The wolf noses Rose's ankle. "Have you a name, bone-sister?"</p><p><em>No</em>.</p><p>"Ah." Rose nods, "Very well. She does not seem very old. Were is she from?"</p><p>"Born in the north as a pup, dragged south in chains." Tim replies, "Though I am concerned that I do not know enough to teach her."</p><p>"And that is where I come in as elder to you both." Rose replies, "Where does she hunt?"</p><p>"She sneaks out of the city." Tim replies, "And terrorizes the lesser creatures in the gardens."</p><p>"Do these lesser creatures include the nobles?"</p><p>"If they are in the gardens, yes."</p><p>The wolf smiles, tongue lolling out of her mouth. Rose gives them both a hard look.</p><p>"Terrible influences."</p><p>"We must find our amusement where we can, blood-sister." Tim smiles, "And you can hardly blame us when they tromp through the place so loudly. It is almost as if they are <em>begging</em> to be snuck up on."</p><p>-</p><p>"How does Nyssa plan to get here? If she steps foot onto the city, the Lazarus will destroy her."</p><p>"Her attacks on our borders serve in many ways. Not only do they weaken our people and cause general unrest, but they distract from our defenses." Tim says, gesturing at the map, "This is proof that she is already among us. She is already here."</p><p>"She means to draw us out of the city. Away from its defenses." Talia says, "It is most likely that she will only send a small force here. It would be impossible to capture the Imperial City with the King still alive. And with the Lazarus being based here, he is practically invincible. She could never win here."</p><p>"So she sets it up so that we face her in combat elsewhere. As long as it is outside of the city she has a chance." Bruce says, "And our forces are so weakened in these border areas that it would take time to mobilize."</p><p>"Connor and Roy have already gone to deliver antidotes and teach the healers how to produce them and block further spread." Tim says, "The alchemists are working on ways to combat the spell and ward against it, as well. But we do not know who is spreading it, other than those who support Nyssa's cause."</p><p>"But <em>who</em>?" Talia sighs, "She is old. Any who would have known her, or known of her, are long dead. Even I have only heard of her in passing."</p><p>"There are so many traps in the court. It makes sense that we would over look any who seemed suspicious." Bruce says, "After all, there are so many vying for the King's favor, or otherwise plotting against him. How are we to know who is who, when we cut off one head another grows in place. It is a perfect place to hide. And Shiva was – she was a consort. The magic of the Consort's Garden would have done anything she wished of it. Including sheltering and silencing those who knew of her alliance with Nyssa if she commanded it."</p><p>"And I had no reason to act otherwise." Tim sighs, "This is why blood and flesh books are <em>important</em>. You cannot merely rely on <em>memory</em>. Especially when you <em>want to forget</em>. But we still do not know how they are getting in, or how they plan to escape."</p><p>"The underground tunnels are an obvious place." Talia points out. "They spread across the entire city, and even wider than the walls. And they go deep. It is the perfect place to hide. The nobles are too selfish to allow them to be eradicated entirely, and the underground serves its own purpose for us. It is impossible to close off."</p><p>"Impossible to completely monitor or control, either. I would know. I am trying." Tim sighs. As it is, for all of Tim's power and the extent of his network, Tim truly only has a faint grasp on a corner of the market. The rest he learns of passively. And can only hope to influence through fear and intimidation. But most often he is wrong. Keeping it to the level of crime it is at now is a sheer miracle. "I can position my whisperers there to monitor – but if that is where the fighting really will break out they will be useless. They are not combat trained for a war situation and the entire point of them being whisperers is that they <em>are noncombatants</em>."</p><p>"Tell me where you place them and I will cover them with my assassins." Talia replies, "But we must figure something out about what to do with our borders. We have to choose where to focus our power, and where Nyssa will be. We cannot spread too thin."</p><p>"Gotham and a few other western lordships will lend aide to the west." Bruce says, "I have managed to negotiate this as a matter of international matters and they are willing to help with little recompense. Or at least, not as much as they would normally ask of the Empire."</p><p>"And of the south?"</p><p>"Connor and Roy are concerned with this plague. Dick and Roy have convinced the southern isles that Nyssa is a threat that spreads to them, and they will defend that border for us as a favor. We will have to change certain trade treaties, but it is nothing we cannot afford to lose in comparison to what we will <em>definitely</em> lose without their aide." Tim answers. "The east is currently, mostly, unaffected and I can only assume that is because that is where Nyssa is."</p><p>"The Land of Edas is neutral." Talia says. "They maintain neutrality and distance from all countries. They are not to be trifled with. Father will most likely order the main bulk of our forces there to meet her head on."</p><p>"Is that wise?" Tim asks. Talia and Bruce exchange looks.</p><p>"Not particularly." Bruce says. " It is always a risk to send the most important member of the country into war directly. But he is the one who knows Nyssa best and the one Nyssa wants to strike at most. If he can end it there, it spares the rest of the country."</p><p>"This is also a matter of bad blood between family." Talia adds on. "If he can cut her off, now. It will be – it will be cleansing. For the country as well as him."</p><p>Tim nods, "And you, Princess? Will you assume the throne while he is away?"</p><p>"No. I will be at his flank. It is dangerous, having two of the direct line of ascent in the fray. But I must be there to rally our forces in support while he is in battle." Talia replies. "And I must also ride out to check in on our other outposts, and I will most likely stay there to handle the damage if we win."</p><p>"And who will rule while you both are away?"</p><p>Talia smiles. Bruce covers Tim's hand with his own.</p><p>"Do you remember, what I told you, Tim? About how I trust you with my children?"</p><p>Tim's eyes widen. "You are <em>insane</em>. I <em>am</em> a child. You are – <em>the King will never agree</em>. I am going to – I'm going to be with him! I am not going to be <em>here</em>."</p><p>"This was the King's will." Talia says, "His orders. You are to remain here when we ride out. Talk to him, if you do not believe us."</p><p>-</p><p><em>I owe you a debt, bone-brother</em>. The wolf says as Tim waits with her outside the city gates. He runs his hand over her head, smiles when she nips her teeth at the soft skin of his inner arm. He curls his <em>seithr</em> around hers. <em>The southerners know not how to see or speak. You have been my voice for me. I thank you</em>.</p><p>"You owe me nothing. In a strange land, strangers stick together. That is the way of frost and thunder, is it not?" Tim says. "Though I will miss you. I wonder what your name will be."</p><p><em>When I find it, I will find your kin and have them tell you.</em> She says, <em>seithr</em> swirling and shifting underneath her paws.</p><p>It is unspoken that they will probably never see each other again. The wolf will return to the north, where she belongs. She will find a pack or a territory and she will be home.</p><p><em>I owe you my seithr</em>. The wolf says, <em>I will not forget. We are the north. Upon my honor, I will always remember you. Berserker of the ruby-scale and hulgr-kin.</em></p>

</p><p>"High Consort." Tim turns, hands pausing over the strings of the instrument Connor had brought him to try. "There is – uh. I do – <em>There is a dragon in the courtyard and it wants to speak with you</em>."</p><p>Tim hears Connor let out an exasperated groan and smiles.</p><p>"<em>She</em> wants to speak with me." He corrects, turning to his friend with an apologetic smile. "Perhaps there will be time for me to learn later."</p><p>"Sometimes I think you conjure these distractions on purpose." Connor chides him, taking Tim's offered hand as they stand, "Just to get out of doing things you are bad at."</p><p>"We have barely even started. For all you know I could be a musical genius."</p><p>"Go to your dragon, Tim. And let me watch from a distance while I try to reign in my incredulousness." Connor says as Tim laughs and goes to follow the pale-faced page. "And don't do anything rash."</p><p>"<em>Me</em>? Do something <em>rash</em>? Why <em>Connor</em>, perish the thought." Tim drawls, waving a hand over his shoulder as the page leads him to the courtyard. It is a good thing that he managed to convince Jason and Cassandra that they did not have to stay around him while Connor was here.</p><p>He wonders if they have heard about this and are going to try and figure out ways to hang him by his toes for the stress, or if they have gone to tell Helena about the dragon.</p><p>Tim spares a moment to <em>hope that no one has told Helena about the dragon</em>. The last thing anyone needs is the girl escaping her watchers in order to see the ruby-scale. He would hate for his mother-dragon to become an enemy of the empire because she ate a member of the royal family.</p><p>Ra's meets him in the main hall, arms folded across his chest.</p><p>"We have only just ended war less than a week ago, my blade. And already there is a dragon upon us seeking your audience. Tell me, is there ever a moment with you that is somewhat close to dull?"</p><p>"I like to keep you on your toes." Tim replies, "Besides, of what use is a dull blade to a king?"</p><p>Tim shifts into his true skin, ignoring the rise in whispers as he walks out into the front courtyard. His mother-dragon is not very small by any means, and it must have been very hard for her to land in such a crowded space. She must have landed during drills, Tim can see practice swords discarded on the stones. He will talk to Z later about that.</p><p><em>Never drop your weapon</em>.  Your weapon is your life, after all.</p><p>"Mother-dragon," Tim says, bowing to press his horns to the ground, "You honor me."</p><p>"<em>You</em> honor <em>me</em>." She replies, great wings flapping once before closing against her body. "You bring honor to your promises, my frost-heart, receiver of my <em>hamrammr</em> and <em>seithr</em>." Tim lifts his head, drawing himself up to his full height as he looks into her. "Upon seeking me out, you promised me you would bring this empire to its knees."</p><p>"That I did." Tim says, every breath causing the frost underneath his feet to spread. <em>Ymir</em>'s power within him stirs. Dragons are blood and bone-kin to the children of frost, and her <em>seithr</em> touches his. It is hard to keep himself contained.</p><p>"You have risen to become the Commander of the Immortal King's armies." She says, "This I have seen."</p><p>"It has been done."</p><p>"Then you fell from that rank, only to rise higher to become his bound-one." She says, eyes glowing with amusement. "You freeze the hallways with gossip of your horns and you warm his bed at night with the thunder of your bones. You have taken the dull shine of tamed gold and turned it into the steel of your kin. This I have seen."</p><p>"It has been done."</p><p>"You encircle the country with your blood. It spreads beyond the borders, so far as the glowing sea of the south, the black ocean of the west, the golden sky of the east, and even back to the bones of our mother-father in the north. This we, kin of the thirteen, first-born of <em>Ymir</em> know. This, I have seen."</p><p>"It has been <em>said</em>." Tim smiles. The dragon rumbles with laughter.</p><p>"Once more, did you fall, to the powers of another. And with you, you brought the entire empire into its death throes. Only to surge once more – aflame with the rage of the land. This I have seen."</p><p>"It has been done."</p><p>She raises her head, wings opening and fanning out, casting soft, blurry-edged shadows across him as she looms over him.</p><p>"You have this country at your fingertips. Its King at your command. Its people at your feet. Its flame in your heart. This, I have seen."</p><p>"It has been done."</p><p>"And so you have earned all that has been promised to you." She says, folding her wings around him, drawing him close. She smells of earth and ozone, the clean and crisp <em>seithr</em> high in the blue sky and the gentle sleepiness of the sun. Tim opens his arms for her, and presses his lips to her scales. "You make the Thirteen proud, frost-born. You are the <em>jarl</em> of the south. And I can sing of what honor you give me, by being <em>my</em> frost-given to my kin. I name you, Timothy the Brave."</p><p>Tim smiles, fingers curling against her scales – feeling the soft feather-touch of her pleased <em>seithr</em> and the almost bubble-like feeling of her joy.</p><p>"Mother-dragon, may I introduce my King to you?"</p><p>"He is not bound to you by blood." She says, voice lowering. "Yet you would introduce him to me."</p><p>"I have not – " Tim bites his cheek. "I have not made him my blood-bound. But regardless of whether he is my blood or not. I want you to meet this man. If you would allow it."</p><p>"Will you make him your blood?" She asks. And there is – if it was Rose, or Slade, or perhaps even Jason who asked, Tim thinks that the question would feel heavier. Like it would mean more. As if there were – judgments behind it.</p><p>But it is his mother-dragon who asks. And when she asks it does not feel like a weight descending upon him.</p><p>"Someday." Tim says. "I think I will."</p><p>It is not a hardship, Tim thinks, to imagine completing the blood-bound ceremony with him. It is not hard at all. It is – actually – altogether too easy. He can taste the image on his mind, feel the way their <em>seithr</em> would combine permanently. He could see where Ra's' <em>seithr </em>would fall into place against his own. How they would blend together and become intrinsic parts of one another.</p><p>But Tim can also see how they will manage apart as well.</p><p>"Someday." Tim says as her wings unfurl.</p><p>"Show me this would-be bond-mate, then." She says as Tim turns and holds out his hand for Ra's, where he stands on the top of the palace steps. "Show me the man who has turned you into a cold-flame."</p><p>-</p><p>Shiva slips into the city in the midst of the chaos of the invasion. Nyssa's forces are many and among the several foreigners who travel into the city daily, and among the merchants and even a few nobles.</p><p>Tim is relieved to find that despite the quarrels the nobles and merchants and lower classes have, those who are loyal to the Empire unite firmly against this intrusion.</p><p>The Lazarus shakes the city, spreading out past its confines to make the streets glow pale green with its rage. It does not take well to these interlopers.</p><p>The Consort's Garden is the safest place to be, and for the first time in perhaps all of history, Tim opens the doors of the Garden to as many as he can. All non-combatants, children, elderly, sick – as many of them who can fit beyond the invisible boundary of the Garden's protections.</p><p>As long as they are within the boundaries of the garden, no harm can come to them. The Consort's will is supreme there, and it is Tim's will that no one with harmful intent may cross. That no living creature fight within its boundaries, and that should all things fall it would remain.</p><p>Ra's said that Tim was to remain within the city, and it is unquestionable that Ra's meant within the safety of the Garden.</p><p><em>However</em>, Tim thinks as he enters the <em>hammask</em>, the man never said so out loud. He simply said that Tim was to remain behind in his place.</p><p>He did <em>not</em> say that Tim could not lead his soldiers into battle in defense of the city.</p><p>And this Tim does. For before he was anything else, he was a soldier. And a Commander. And did he not say that their only creed and tenant was to protect? Some example he would lead if he were to hide behind the magics of the Garden rather than face their foes.</p><p>Tim is quiet, the silence of the <em>hulgr</em> making him practically invisible to enemy senses, as he quickly slips behind the intruder farthest back from the main platoon and covers his mouth with a cloth soaked in sleeping drought. He will not be up for hours after this. And hopefully by then the city will be back under the control of the guards.</p><p>It would probably be smarter to just <em>kill</em> these people. But Tim knows firsthand that Nyssa's powers of the mind are not so easily fought. And he truly hopes that these men and women who fight against their own people are doing it out of some sick <em>geas</em> rather than out of their own free will.</p><p>Perhaps it is foolish and optimistic. But being in this land of light and blooming trees and sweet fruits and songbirds has <em>made</em> him that way, he thinks. In this land that had brought him low then raised him to heights that would never had been possible had he stayed in his stead with his dam and sire.</p><p>It has changed him and Tim does not know if he will ever think it is for the better.</p><p>He is careful to make sure that the man makes no sound, disarms him and settles him against a wall. He gestures for his fellows to move forward, watching their <em>seithr</em> move onwards to silence one man at a time. He has units like this all over the city. But it is the ones closest to the palace he takes care of himself.</p><p>It would help greatly if Cassandra were here among them. She would instantly see the ones who are the true threats. But she is not. She has a greater task ahead of her. One that Tim cannot see or truly stomach.</p><p>His mouth dries as he thinks about the fate that awaits his sister and he wishes he had something to offer the flame that loves neither she nor her opponent.</p><p>("I do not know what she wants from all of this." Cassandra says as they get ready for battle, "But it will end with this last clash. And I do not know if I will survive it. Perhaps <em>this</em> is my trial of fire. My rite of passage. You said that in the North you seek a challenge worthy of your name. I have no name. I am simply <em>Cassandra</em>. Daughter of Shiva. Shiva. The daughter of None."</p><p>"You are my sister."</p><p>"I am myself." She says. "And today, I shall find out what that is, exactly.")</p><p>It stings his pride that the attack here is merely an afterthought. The true strike is somewhere far where he cannot be, away from where his touch may sway the tide of war. He wonders if the King is safe. If the battle there has yet started. Where, exactly is it. The terrain, the weather, the <em>seithr</em> of the land. Tim wonders if there are any household flames that may impact the battle nearby. If the land is flat, if they have the advantage of height or obstacles. They are plains, if Tim is remembering correctly. Grassland, for the most part.</p><p>Tim wonders if they war on farmer's lands, and what those farmers will graze their cattle on afterwards.</p><p>If there are farmers who are still alive to graze their cattle.</p><p>"You are distracted." Z says, lightly pressing his fingers to Tim's back. "Your focus should be here, High Consort. The King can handle himself."</p><p>"Am I so obvious?"</p><p>"To the untrained eye, the High Consort remains, as ever, a staid and noble example of what every citizen and soldier should aspire to be." Z replies, "But I have been with you since you could not speak and were fool enough to believe every lie that came out of Owen's mouth. To <em>me</em>, Tim, you look like you are ready to worry your lip to pieces over the fate of our King and Princess."</p><p>Tim sighs, "Sometimes I feel like you mock me but unlike with the others you have somehow mastered the ability to make all jests appear like harmless air."</p><p>"I know not of what you mean. Now proceed, King's Blade. We have much work to do and citizens to protect. We have news from the whisperers of the direction of the next group to have passed through Talia's forces."</p><p>"Any word from Jason?"</p><p>"He has gotten most of the slums to safe points and is working on clearing out sections of the underground as far away from the entrances being used by infiltrators and from the ones closest to the fighting. They follow his word without resistance, as he bears your mark."</p><p>Tim has no idea why Z was not appointed as Commander before Tim. The man is rational and loyal, and as ever, completely unshaken by anything. Tim swears to the skies that if the entire Earth were to be turned up side down, Z would merely blink, readjust himself, and then continue about his day after inquiring about the King's state of health.</p><p>"I still do not know why he did not take <em>you</em> along, at least." Tim mumbles. Z shrugs. Tim cannot see his expression past his mask, but Tim expects that he is smiling.</p><p>"You <em>are</em> fun to pester, High Consort. And you handle pressure astonishingly well." Tim remembers an entire conversation with Z about how his promotion was a joke meant to irritate the nobles, give Ra's a source of amusement, and provide gossip for the masses. And then a later conversation when Tim was appointing <em>Z</em> as his replacement about how the promotion was a joke meant to gain revenge for earlier mocking, a source for Tim's amusement, and provide gossip for the soldiers. "Besides, the King wants me to protect you."</p><p>"More like make sure I do not sneak out and chase after him." Tim says, looking up towards the innocuous morning sky. Attacking in broad daylight. Such a <em>bold</em> declaration. She is either very confident or out of her mind.</p><p>Knowing who her sire is, she is most likely <em>both.</em></p><p>"Lead on, Commander." Tim sighs, "And let us hope that the Lazarus does not grow impatient."</p><p>-</p><p>There are not many colors in the North. Or at least, not in the full range of what is used in the south. Dark blacks and grays, blues and browns. The occasional spot of deep green or dark red. Muted yellows. White and deep, deep violet.</p><p>But color is rare. Color means being seen in the vast landscape of eternal snow. The mountains are black, the seas are gray-navy, and the land is blanketed in frost. The trees are dark skeletons that pierce the sky.</p><p>Steads with trees that molt their leaves and change colors like they have been set on flame are rare and border the western lands. On the stead where Tim grew up, the brightest colors were seen in textiles and inks brought by traders. Never bought. Too much extravagance and unnecessary.</p><p>The only thing with true color was <em>seithr</em>. Of what point was there in the use of gaudy cloths and brilliant woads when your <em>seithr</em> could change and cover a vast horizon of colors? And there is nothing more beautiful than the glittering sparkle of ice on a clear summer day – struck by the rising sun and casting a multi-colored glow upon everything it touches. There is a famous cave for lovers, the rainbow cave, where it is said that when the sun strikes the ice – all things captured within the cave would turn into the most precious of opals.</p><p>Slade had met and courted Adeline there. Tim had once thought that perhaps if he had found someone to court, or was courted, he would go there as well.</p><p><em>Ymir</em> bestows great fortune on couples who seek his favor there. And in a way, Tim supposes that Slade and his mate were fortunate, for a time.</p><p>But color in general is rather rare.</p><p>Tim is dazzled by the veritable barrage of it, here. And how it is all so complexly pieced together. Blues with oranges, blacks and golds, greens and purples, pinks and yellows. It is all so stunning.</p><p>"It suits you." Ra's says as he dresses, hand running over the thin silk of one of the scarves he wraps over his head and face when he goes out. I tis the right of nobles to cover their skin with so many baubles – so many layers and cloths, as well as the ability to wear them daily is the right of nobles. For the common folk who must work with their hands it is impractical to have so much cloth, and such finery. Tim thinks it's impractical as well, but he is the High Consort, now. "Though I am somewhat bothered that you are ignoring the royal colors."</p><p>"Green, I am told, makes me look sickly." Tim says, "And I rather like red. It is a hard color to find in the north unless you split something open. And I have only grown more fond of it the longer I stay here." His mother-dragon is a ruby-scale, after all. And he is proud to wear her colors.</p><p>"By whom? I would happen to disagree."</p><p>"Because you are a predictably possessive like every other man who thinks he has a pretty and priceless lover." Tim snorts.</p><p>Ra's raises an eyebrow.</p><p>"I will not apologize for my words."</p><p>"You rarely do and I did not ask you to." Ra's says, taking Tim's hands and sliding some rings onto his fingers. Tim sighs at the feeling of the metal on his skin. It is annoying and he will, undoubtedly, end up losing at least one somewhere by the end of the day. "I find it interesting that you choose the colors that oppose mine as your own. And they are somewhat like what the rumors of the city say about a certain little bird who has been plaguing my city for years, now."</p><p>"What bird."</p><p>"How stupid do you really think I am that I would not <em>know</em> what you do in my city, under my nose when you did not even bother to truly hide it?"</p><p>"Do you want me to answer that?"</p>

</p><p>The city still stands, mostly whole and intact after Nyssa's attack, and Tim slowly gets trickles of information from his whisperers. Other cities were attacked, and the fake guards who had staged attacks in other areas moved in to try and conquer more territory. The fighting was hard in some areas, but they won overall. They kept everything and in the end Ra's won against Nyssa.</p><p>Tim watches the Lazarus' <em>seithr</em> retreat back into the palace,  sinking into the ground to return to its chamber.</p><p>The attack started in the morning, a slow infiltration that had Tim sending and dispatching the assassins and spies to quietly eliminate, and then turned into full blown fighting just before noon.</p><p>According to the messages sent by other whisperers is that similar tactics were used elsewhere. Tim thanks Harper's reworking of Bruce's magical tools for how quickly they were able to coordinate their defenses. Tim wonders if Nyssa has similar tools at her disposal or if her people are truly that well coordinated on their own.</p><p>"When can we expect the others back?" Tim says as he pulls his boots off. He is hot, and regardless of whether he was in the shade or not or how little fighting he truly did, it is hot and it has been quite some time since he has done such work. Z holds Tim's arm steady as he peels off parts of his armor, breathing a sigh of relief when the cooler air brushes against his skin.</p><p>"The only reports we have gotten are that we are successful. No other information has come in from the King's camp." Z replies, letting go as Tim steps into the fountain. Tim sighs as the water crackles and starts to freeze around him. Tim moves his legs a little to make sure he doesn't freeze it entirely through. Tim straightens up, stretching and feeling a burn across his lower back. Tim can't help the small smile when he sees other soldiers and combatants coming towards the fountain and joining him. "But he is well, I think. We would have heard otherwise."</p><p>"That is reassuring. Where is Cassandra?"</p><p>"Missing." Tim's stomach clenches, "Along with Shiva."</p><p>"No one has seen either of them?" Tim bites his cheek, "Jason? Civilians?"</p><p>"Fine." Z reassures him, "Jason is seeing to the reorganization of the slums. Everyone is returning to where they should be. We are rounding up the infiltrators as we speak. Civilians are being returned to their homes. It is fine. Rest, High Consort. The Imperial City still stands and the country has not fallen."</p><p>Tim turns to look out over the water, and the city splayed out below them. The view of the city has always been beautiful. The way the fountains of the main courtyard and the waterways all blend together and fall in steps and layers create an invisible horizon line of sorts. The way the sunlight hits the city walls, casts shadows over the lower districts, the higher ones, and the water. It is beautiful.</p><p>Tim wonders if it is odd for him to be thinking about the sunset right now.</p><p>"I will be waiting in the Consort's Gallery for them." Tim says, closing his eyes. There is much work to be done and much of it will be done on paper. "Tell me if there is anything else. But for now – I leave things here in your capable hands, Commander."</p><p>Z bows, "Yes, High Consort. Please do not overwork yourself too much."</p><p>"The same can be said of you, Z."</p><p>-</p><p>"I do not know all things." Cassandra says, startling him when she appears. Tim almost drops his practice sword. She comes forward, adjusting his grip on it, nodding, and letting go. But she is still close. Tim shifts his weight. "I know what they say about me. I do not know. I read. Faces. Bodies. They say things. That words find hard to express. I am not good with words."</p><p>She shrugs, smiles. "I am better at bodies."</p><p>Cassandra stays with him as he trains, tossing pebbles at his weak points until he fixes his stance, nudging his feet with her own until he's steady. She says very little, but through her touch Tim thinks he can understand what she means. Cassandra somehow just <em>knows</em>. She knows whenever he is uncertain. She knows whenever he does not understand or is uncomfortable with his steps, whenever his movements contain a moment of hesitation, and whenever a strike makes him feel unsteady. She knows and corrects him with absolute certainty.</p><p>"Bodies have a language." Cass says, and Tim turns to her. "I know the language."</p><p>"How?"</p><p>She is quiet for a moment before she shrugs. "I did not speak for a long time. I did not understand."</p><p>"Then how did you learn?"</p><p>"Bruce. Barbara. Jason. Dick." She says, makes a sharp gesture with her hands. "I understand. I understand <em>you</em>. Vague ideas. Meaning behind meaning. But not always the meaning they want. I understand. Not knowing home."</p><p>Tim lowers his eyes.</p><p>"Find one." She says. "That is all you have to do."</p><p>-</p><p>"Do you know what your name means?" Mother says, as he curls in the cradle made by her skirt as she kneels by the fire.</p><p>"No." Tim answers, trying to squirm away as she dabs the blood off his forehead. The bone hurts, and Tim is happy to have his horns, but he is also sad because of how much it hurts and itches. His head feels heavy and he feels tired all the time. The <em>seithr</em> in the air gives him a headache and he is always dizzy. Mother has taken to carrying him on her back from a sling she fashioned from some leather and string like he is a baby. It is <em>embarrassing</em>.</p><p>"Your father and I named you <em>Timothy</em>." Mother says, signing his name with one hand. Tim watches the <em>seithr</em> shift – turning white and gold with her pride, and the <em>seithr</em> around her turning a pale pink with warmth. It tastes soft and feels a little like the soft insides of berries. "It means <em>he who honors god</em>. When I was giving birth to you, I had a vision. I felt <em>Ymir's </em>voice inside of me. And the mother-father whispered that you will bring glory to my name and my stead. That you would be the greatest <em>jarl</em> to ever be crowned."</p><p>Tim stills as she tilts his head back, the fire catches in her red-blue eyes as she examines his growing horns. Her hands are cool on the hot skin, and feel good against Tim's aching head. She is molding them, making sure that the bone and soft flesh does not form unevenly or crooked. It hurts, but it is a different kind of hurt. Duller than the way the bone seems to be seeping the strength from him, and kinder than the ache of <em>seithr</em> pressing against him.</p><p>"And when your horns did not come I worried that I was wrong. That I had offended <em>Ymir</em> by being too brash." Mother clicks her tongue. "I worried that I misunderstood. But how could I? You are my flesh. You are Jack's flesh. You <em>must</em> be great. Your father worried so. And he consulted his flesh-kin and his womb-kin. I spoke with my own blood-kin. Some said we should have done a <em>domovyk</em> ceremony for you. That perhaps a dark thing had taken your horns, in envy of <em>Ymir's</em> glory. Other said that I was wrong. A few even said that you may had been born with the wrong spirit inside of you. But do you know what Mac-<em>amme</em> said?"</p><p>"No." Tim curls his fingers around the leather thongs that hang around his mother's neck, running his fingers over the small glass beads and and small bones. "What did Mac-<em>amme</em> say?"</p><p>"She held you in her arms and smiled. And she said that it was foolish to worry." Mother's lips part to reveal her smile. "You were too young, then. A boy's horns should crest as a baby. A girl's at her first to second winter. But Mac-<em>amme</em> said that those loved by <em>seithr</em> – loved by <em>Ymir</em> would gain their horns when they were ready to understand <em>Ymir's</em> sacrifice. And that is the way it has always been. What are a frost-born's horns, Tim? Do you know? Has your sire told you the stories?"</p><p>"No, ma." Tim says, eyes closing as mother wraps the new bone in soft cloth, soaked in water from Mac-<em>amme's</em> spring.  He could not sit still and father gave up and let Tim play, teaching Tim how to climb instead. Mother laughs.</p><p>"He has always spoiled you." She says, "Where do we get our horns from?"</p><p>"The dragons who love us."</p><p>"Yes. You know that much, at least." Mother laughs. Tim flinches at the sound, and the way the <em>seithr</em> pounds his head. Mother stops, pressing her fingers against the side of his head. She clicks her tongue. "Our horns are what allow us to understand <em>seithr</em>, Tim. Because they are the bones of dragons, the bones given and formed by the blood, flesh, and bone of <em>Ymir. </em>We are not children of <em>Ymir</em>. We are the get of the thirteenth dragon. And in the beginning every dragon had two pairs of horns. So they gave us their second pair so that we may see the world <em>Ymir</em> gifted us with and truly understand <em>Ymir's</em> sacrifice."</p><p>She sets Tim on his feet, brushing her fingers over his head.</p><p>"Our horns are a gift, Tim. To allow us to see, taste, feel, hear, and smell the world around us. But when we are babes we do not have the words for it. We do not know the world yet, and so we accept all the feelings as they are. They are ours and part of our world."</p><p>"But I could always see <em>seithr</em>." Tim says.</p><p>"Yes. But when your horns have fully formed and crested, you will understand <em>seithr</em> better. That I promise<em>.</em>" Mother says. "Because you are older, because you know the world, now – you will see. When your horns are finished, you will understand the pain of <em>Ymir</em>. You will know <em>Ymir's</em> suffering, <em>Ymir's</em> experience. The pain and beauty of the world around you." Mother rests her cheek on Tim's head. "It is because <em>Ymir</em> loves you that your horns come late. As is the way with all who are <em>Ymir-</em>loved."</p><p>"And when it is over – I will be stronger?" Tim asks, "I will be better?"</p><p>"You will be as you were meant to be. No more. No less." Mother says. "Dragon-born. <em>Ymir-</em>loved."</p><p>-</p><p>"As my blade, this is yours." Ra's says, "You are my arm, my shield, but most of all you are my sword."</p><p>Tim holds out his hands, taking in the weight and stark simplicity of the King's sword. He is certain that there is magic in the blade. It is old and well cared for. It has been at the King's side longer than perhaps anything else in this world, save the Lazarus.</p><p>He is sure that there is some sort of spirit attached to it. A heartbeat. He has heard of objects gaining ghosts over a long period of time. And with the amount of blood it has spilled, with the amount of enemies it has felled and lives it must have saved – Tim is certain that there is some sort of spirit dwelling within the blade.</p><p>Tim removes his own blade from his waist, securing the King's sword there instead. It is not his duty to draw it. In fact, as the King's Blade he will never draw this sword. That is not the function of this act.</p><p>He is the carrier of the sword, the hand of the King. Bringing it forward and presenting it when it is time.</p><p>"Yes." Tim replies, securing his own sword on his other side. It will take time to learn how to move with the new weight and bulk of the King's heavier sword at his side. But he <em>will</em> learn. And Tim has never had much patience for blades anyway. It is not as if he draws his own sword when he fights. He draws just as well with either hand. What side his own blade is on will not be a problem. "I am honored."</p><p>"You are the first blade I have had in quite some time." Ra's says. "It will be an experience for the both of us, I am sure. Though I do expect you to keep up with both your duties as my blade <em>and</em> as my Commander."</p><p>Ra's hands Tim a stack of books, "Perhaps you should start with reading these records. If you have trouble reading, I am sure Jason is more than willing to help."</p><p>The King <em>knows</em> Tim struggles with understanding the multiple layers of the southern script, that <em>ass</em>. Tim feels his cheek twitch.</p><p>Tim raises an eyebrow. "I am starting to regret this already."</p><p>-</p><p>Ra's is not overly injured, at least – not by the time he returns to the Imperial City. The magic of the Lazarus that remains within his veins, combined with the war-mages who went with him would have been more than enough to repair the worst of the damage. Talia arrives ahead of her father, and is quick to make a line straight for Damian, Helena, and Selina.</p><p>"You are all safe." She says, sweeping Damian and Helena into her arms. "I am – I am relieved."</p><p>"Did you think we could not handle things on our own territory?" Selina replies, eyebrow raised as she runs her hand over Talia's back. "And you seem whole and hale."</p><p>"We are fine, mother." Damian says, "What of the battle? No one will tell us anything."</p><p>"There has been no news to tell." Tim says, "The King – he is well?"</p><p>Talia's mouth is a thin line that turns into a slight curve, her arms tightening around her children.</p><p>"Father is well, High Consort. He did not emerge from the battle unscathed, but he will not be needing the Lazarus flame's power, and he will be fine with suitable rest and recovery. I – I am thankful to you. You defended the city well. There are few signs of the battles that happened here. And in surrounding cities as well. You maneuvered the troops wonderfully."</p><p>It is something he is told repeatedly by others. By Bruce, by Dick. By other commanders. By the Ubu. By the older whisperers who were originally assassins and soldiers.</p><p>By Ra's.</p><p>"You have done well, my blade." Ra's says as Tim helps ease him onto the bed. "I told you, your place was here."</p><p>"Yes, yes. I obeyed your orders, be pleased with yourself." Tim sighs. And it is probably some sort of terrible, but Tim is -</p><p>The presence of these wounds, these bandages – they make Tim feel better. Some will scar. Some will not. But the ones what do scar -</p><p>They are memories. Memories Tim knows, and Ra's' body has always had scars in Tim's mind. Their absence makes the man seem too innocuous. Too deceptive. The Immortal King is a warrior, a champion, first and foremost. Always. And the blankness, the newness of Ra's' skin has always disturbed him.</p><p>"The best defense is a good offense, as everyone knows." Ra's says, cupping the side of Tim's throat. "And you are my greatest offense. The Imperial City looks as if it did not know war at all. Even the Lazarus is pleased – or as pleased as it can ever be. Though it is somewhat discontent with the new addition to its chamber. As am I."</p><p>"It was Cassandra's fight. It is her decision. I will support her in it." Tim replies. "Do not move Shiva's body."</p><p>"I did not say I would." Ra's sighs.</p><p>"Think of it as a testament to the power of your house." Tim says, running a finger over the bandage that peers out of Ra's' collar. "The one who was once known as the Lady of Death hangs over your flame, defeated by a daughter of your house. Now tell me of what occurred."</p><p>Ra's raises an eyebrow and tells him. It is not the same as the way they speak of battles in the north, and Tim keeps part of his mind separate and distant. Translating so that he may relate it to Rose and Slade later, in the proper way. With <em>seithr</em> and magic.</p><p>"Nyssa is wise, and knew I would come for her. She had turned the plains to nothing by the time we had arrived." Ra's says, "Villagers dead or gone. Or otherwise – <em>afflicted</em>." Ra's shakes his head. "Nyssa wanted nothing more than to ruin what I had built. I took her family away, she would take my people away. She had grown twisted. They were her people as well."</p><p>Ra's folds his long fingers together, closing his eyes. He looks so weary.</p><p>"She had allies from Edas, and from the small northern countries that dot the mountain range that separates <em>your</em> north from the mountains of Edas. We were afraid we would lose the villages and cities on that border as well. I was getting ready to send the First Consort there along with a good portion of the soldiers I had rode out with." Ra's' lips twitch up, "Imagine my surprise when I hear that a pack of dire-wolves had descended the mountain and blocked off the passage between the Edas mountain ranges and the lower hills and plains."</p><p>Ra's reaches into his coat and pulls out a small working. Tim recognizes it immediately. The <em>seithr</em> within it sings of Mac-<em>amme's</em> clan, and the she-wolf. Tim smiles as he takes it, his bone-sister found a clan after all.</p><p>"A message, I believe."</p><p>"The she-wolf you gifted me with." Tim explains. She had always said she owed Tim a debt. Tim did not think she would ever have a chance to repay it. "Was she well – did – did anyone see her?"</p><p>"Bruce did. And she gave him this for you. According to Bruce, she was quite large and the leader of her pack." Ra's says.</p><p>Tim runs his fingers over the working, feeling Mac-<em>amme's</em> love, the <em>seithr</em> of the land wishing him well. And the she-wolf's <em>seithr. </em>He tastes her words – her name. Smiles.</p><p>"I told you that dire-wolves are not pets." Tim says. "Prejya really helped you, didn't she? If you <em>did</em> split your forces like that you would not have been able to hold your defensive line so easily."</p><p>"Nyssa did not expect any interference from the north." Ra's says, "It is so rare for the creatures of frost and thunder to descend. They are not a united group, and she had thought you to be weakened. Especially when left behind."</p><p>"We are not nations but blood." Tim says, "You stir one drop, you stir the pool. And you never know just how far that pool spreads. It could lead to an ocean."</p><p>"Your reach does extend far, most beloved one. And I do not think any of us could have anticipated just what she was stirring when she struck at you. You are the heart of a vast and sleeping monster." Ra's says, "And I am grateful to have that slumbering giant on my side."</p><p>-</p>

</p><p>There are many different ways to bind someone with your blood. Different types of <em>blood-bound</em> that are all expressed through different <em>seithr</em> and motions.</p><p>Tim's blood-bind to Jason is that of brothers, war and struggle. The sign-<em>seithr</em> of wolf-crow-stone. The brother you trust to have your back in a fight, the brother you trust with your eyes and your ears in peace. His blood-bind to Cassandra is that of a sister, silence and deceit. Shown with the sign of raven-forest-drake. The sister you trust to listen, to hold her tongue, and to strike where you are weak in order for your bone to heal best.</p><p>Rose and Slade are blood-of-blood. Blood-bonds renewed through generations. Dragon-drake-serpent. Slade was his mother's blood-bound-brother. If mother had lived, Tim and Rose would be blood-bound brother-sister. Like Cass. And Slade is his blood-father. An <em>Uncle</em>, they say, here. But that is not the case, and so they become his blood-of-blood. Flesh and bone that has come together for generations, and chooses to stay with the liquid of life.</p><p>Harper and Cullen are blood bound, as claw-siblings. Crow-raven-dragon's wing. He would fight for them. He will protect them. He will protect them, their happiness and their wellbeing, with everything he has. Always. And they will do the same, but the exchange is not completely equal. In some ways Tim does more. In some ways <em>they</em> do more. It is a physical to mental exchange. His support is mostly physical. Money, food, supplies, shelter, defense. Theirs is not. Information, knowledge, ideas, advice, support. Claw-siblings.</p><p>Bruce and Selina are not Tim's blood. He is uncertain if they would want to be. But if they were, Tim would take them as blood-father, wolf-deep dweller-drake, and blood-mother bear-cave-hearth. Or mentors, hearth-wolf-<em>hulgr</em>.</p><p>He is not blood-bound to his mother-dragon, no. That binding goes deeper than even blood, straight into bone. They are bone and blood. For the dragons and frost-children all descend from <em>Ymir's</em> bones, and it is from the dragons that the frost-children are born. She is bone and blood, and her <em>seithr</em> has permanently fused with his own.  Her heart beats with his.</p><p>Dick, Damian, and Helena are not blood-bound, either. Perhaps, someday, Tim will ask Dick to bind with him. But it feels so hard to do so. Dick is a roaming point. He goes everywhere, like the wind and storms. Some days he is here, some days he is across the globe. It does not feel right to ask Dick to tie himself to anything. At least, not with something so permanent. Tim will settle with calling Dick his brother. Damian and Helena – it remains to be seen. He thinks that he most likely will not ask them to be bound to him.</p><p>Blood-binds are permanent. There is no way to absolve them. <em>Ymir</em> frowns upon those who do. Blood is not to be taken lightly.</p><p>In the event in which you wish to dissolve your blood-bond, you must do many things. It is a long and painful process. Especially if it is only done on one end. But it can be done. It is not absolution. It is a break. Part of your heart, your <em>seithr</em>, is gone forever. You will always feel the pain of losing them. Of being the one to <em>break</em> what should never be broken. It is taboo.</p><p>The blood-bond Tim does now is – it is not the greatest of them all. For no blood-bond is ranked above the other. But it is, perhaps, the most sacred of blood-bonds. And the rarest.</p><p>The blood-bond of the <em>Seele</em>.</p><p>The soul.</p><p>It is not the same as marriage or mating. Slade and his mates never formed the <em>Seele</em> bond. Mother and Father never formed the <em>Seele</em> bond. They were blood-bound, yes, but not through <em>Seele</em>.</p><p>Tim watches Ra's' <em>seithr</em> – steady and calm, certain and unwavering.</p><p>"The war is over. For all that it could be considered a war." Tim says running his fingers over the veins on Ra's' arm. "And you have returned, victorious."</p><p>"We are victorious." Ra's says, patient as Tim traces runes onto Ra's' skin with <em>seithr</em>. Tim wonders if Ra's can see it. Taste it. It is the most delicate <em>seithr</em> Tim has ever had. Light, almost the color of pearls. Their sheen and gloss. He wonders if Ra's can feel that, too. He knows he has charged it enough to be visible. What does it look like, in Ra's' eyes, he wonders. "And there is peace once more."</p><p>"Until the next time."</p><p>"Until the next time." Ra's agrees. Tim finishes writing the runes, and slowly guides Ra's' hand to write onto his skin. Ra's does not know how to manipulate <em>seithr</em>. Not like Tim can. It is hard to manipulate what you cannot see-taste-feel-smell. Harder still if you have never sensed it at all. But Tim knows.</p><p>It will work regardless. It will.</p><p>Ra's' finger is warm on Tim's skin as he traces his finger in the shape of the runes Tim had him learn. He starts at Tim's right wrist, going up and tracing over his collarbone, finger lingering at the dip, and flowing over to Tim's right arm.</p><p>Tim folds their hands together, fingers curling into Ra's', nails softly pressing into the underside of his fingers. He calls <em>Ymir</em> forward.</p><p>The <em>Seele</em> bond is the only bond in which <em>Ymir</em> is present.</p><p>The sign is <em>Ymir-dragon-home</em>.</p><p>He can see the Lazarus' <em>seithr</em> surging, blanketing Ra's' body. It makes sense, Tim thinks as he feels <em>Ymir</em> – his own <em>seithr</em>, pale blue and soft white – flowing through his body and into the runes he drew on Ra's' skin, making them glow-spark-glisten like ice. The Lazarus is just as much a part of Ra's as the mother-dragon and <em>hulgr</em> are part of Tim.</p><p>Tim has already had the Lazarus in him before. But it is different. The Lazarus was passing through, searching and burning and destroying, before. It's remnants just flickers that got caught in his <em>seithr</em>. This is different.</p><p>He does not close his eyes when he sees Ra's' <em>seithr</em> – the Lazarus and something else, something old, something powerful, something that is just <em>Ra's</em> – flow into him. It is warm. The feeling of gold and the touch of silk, the hard metal of a blade in one's hand, the heart-racing feeling of running over rooftops and the rush of wind on your face as you jump.</p><p>Tim see-hears-tastes-feels-smells glimpses. Flashes of Ra's' life. He feels the loss of losing someone you love, so many times. The joy of a child being born. Tim feel-tastes the first time Ra's lays eyes on him. The joy of Damian being born. The light dimming at losing Nyssa. The irritation at the challenges issued to his reign. Feeling the drifting sensation of not knowing where to go. The blur of boredom and idle days. Sunlight on leaves, the warm under-velvet of plants on fingertips. The heady smell of spring in full boom, the taste of bitter wine.</p><p>Childhood and hunger. Sleepless nights. Cold mornings. Heavy rainfall. Nyssa's face. Talia's first steps. Damian's birth. Bruce's quiet voice giving advice. A pale boy, an albino boy, being taken into the Ubu ranks.</p><p>Tim wonders what Ra's sees through Tim's <em>seithr</em>. If he sees his mother's face, his father's hands. Does he see Mac-<em>amme's</em> wizened smile, feel her strong arms? The sight of sunlight scattering off of ice in the mornings, the sound of the <em>hulgr-folke</em> making mischief in the trees among each other? Does he feel the sorrow and fear of the raid that decimated his home?</p><p>The warmth of the ruby-scale's wings and the heavy drum of her heartbeat, the song Mac-<em>amme</em> sings on name-days. Jason's laughter and Dick's smile. Bruce's quiet shadow. Cassandra teaching him to fight. Helena's small little hands clapping as Tim sing-weaves a story she cannot fully understand.</p><p>Prejya's paws on his thighs as she nudges him awake, her teeth nipping at his skin to get him moving. The burn of his horns as they first crested. The loss and pain at being trapped in southern form for so long.</p><p>It is not the same as <em>knowing</em> someone. These glimpses are sensations, moments, and nothing more. Tim wonders at the stories behind them. If he will pick them out of Ra's, minute by minute. At night or in the mornings. And marvels that he has the time to do so. That he has a right to do so.</p><p>Tim feels Ra's' fingers curl into his.</p><p>"Timothy." Ra's leans forward, and his face is not the one Tim saw the first time they met. Pain-hazed, bitter, angry, and ready to die in a dungeon, waiting for his sentence. It is not the face Tim saw as a boy. A boy turning into a soldier to fight in a strange land for strange people. It is not even the face that Tim vowed to serve, as Commander and Blade. But it is still a face that Tim has come to know.</p><p>"Ra's." Tim replies, "I do not know what <em>love</em> is. But this is what I have to give you."</p><p>There is no word for <em>love</em> in the north. It is such a vague concept for such a small word. Love of family, love of brother, love of sister, love of mother, love of partners, love of mentors, love of friends. Too many types and just one word. Love of clothes, love of food. Love of knowledge. Too many things. Too many levels. It is too hard to understand the weight of it.</p><p>Tim does not know if this, what he feels now, is what they mean by <em>love</em>.</p><p>But it is <em>Seele</em>. It is <em>soul</em>.</p><p>It is everything that Tim is capable of giving and more.</p><p>"I strive to be worthy of this honor." Ra's replies, "And to return it, many fold."</p><p>Tim feels the <em>seithr</em> settling. His own is now white-blue-gold. Ra's' is jade-gold-white. It is permanent. Forever and always. Their <em>seithr</em> is one, now. Something that goes deep past flesh and titles, paper and law, tradition and custom.</p><p>It is not marriage.</p><p>It is not mating.</p><p>It is <em>blood</em>.</p><p> </p>

    <p>Chapter End Notes</p>
    <blockquote class="userstuff"><p>And that's the end of it. Thank you so much for sticking with me and reading this fic. Thank you to everyone who commented, especially Gadhar who left really great comments.</p><p>People Tim's blood-bound to:<br/>Jason (brother), Cassandra (sister), Cullen and Harper (claw-siblings), Slade (blood-of-blood), Rose (blood-of-blood), Ra's (<i>Seele</i>)<br/>Members of Tim's coterie who are not blood-bound to him:<br/>Dick, Selina, Bruce<br/>Members of Tim's network who are not part of the coterie or blood-bound:<br/>Connor Hawke, Roy Harper, Z, Prudence, Owens, Barbara (Stephanie who does not actually appear in the story orz)</p><p>*Consort's guards are dressed in black and gold, with a camellia insignia (either on an armband or on their chest), with members who are also part of Tim's network wearing a small stylized eye in gold. Jason's "eyes" are large and on both sides of his hood. The Consort's guards are the High Consort's personal army and respond to no one else and are exempt from all other chains of command. The Consort chooses the guards personally, and may take them from anywhere in the country - from the elite guard, army, assassins, nobles, merchants, prisoners, slaves, etc.<br/>*The Ubu are the King's guards, dressed in white with face-masks. As with the Consort's guards, they are obligated to no one but the King and are outside the chain of command. All of the Ubu are known only as The Ubu, forfeiting title, names, personal belongings, and identity upon joining the Ubu ranks. They are chosen the same as the Ubu, though it is more likely for the Ubu to just recruit their own.</p><p>*Histories are not told in reigns, as there has only been one Immortal King (though there is a vague time referenced to a small village that was once the Imperial City before the King was born), but in Consorts. The era of Spring Consort the first, the Summer Consort the I...so on and so forth, as while the King is unchanging the Consorts are, and the way the King rules can vastly change depending on the Consort at his side. Tim's reign is called the reign of the Winter Consort, but more commonly, the Bladed Consort, as he is the only consort to serve both as the King's Blade and the High Consort. As High Consort Tim no longer carries Ra's' sword at all times, but it is generally somewhere near his person (on himself or with one of his attendants).<br/>*Because Tim is so quiet he scares a lot of people by appearing suddenly - from windows, secret passages, etc.- so Ra's has him wear an anklet of small gold bells. Tim has taken it as a personal challenge to walk even quieter.<br/>**Tim is rather unusual in that he sleeps in the King's rooms just as often as he sleeps in the Consort's Gallery. And vice versa. It is rather odd, and the nobles often whisper about impropriety but the servants are used to it by now.</p><p>*At his first appearance, Ra's was in his late-fifties to early sixties. Talia, Bruce, Selina, and Shiva at their mid-thirties to early forties.  Upon entering the Lazarus pit, Ra's emerges in his late twenties to early thirties.<br/>**The King's colors are green/gold/white. The Consort's traditional colors are green/gold/black, but Tim has them changed to red/gold/black because he thinks the color green makes him look sickly.<br/>***Tim has some freckles in southern skin because of his pale complexion, but when he shifts they're gone. The frost-form has red sclera, horns, paler skin, sharper teeth, and sharper nails. Regardless of form Tim's body temperature is naturally lower than everyone else's - thought it dips much lower in frost-form.</p></blockquote>
