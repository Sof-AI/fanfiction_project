<!--chapter content-->
<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>At thirty-one, Philza is a general and a name to be feared. He is standing in an enemy camp, the other members of his strike force at his side, sword drawn - they are an assassination attempt in action, and they have almost achieved their goal - when it occurs to him, out of the blue, that he has a family.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Bit of a strange place to find them, but he doesn’t mind. Philza jerks his head - the plan is in motion with all its little clockwork gears, all Wilbur’s devising, and the four of them have to carry it out now no matter what Philza may or may not just have realised. Technoblade to watch their backs, on this occasion, and Tommy to jimmy locks and cause distractions and run faster than Philza’s ever seen anyone else move, and Wilbur to talk them out of places that Philza fights them into - they’re a very capable family, Philza thinks, and just barely stifles a laugh.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Family or not, they’re kind of in the middle of something. He should probably focus.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>
    <br/>
  </span>
  <span>It goes well. Tommy finds them a twisting path out of the camp when they are chased, and Wilbur’s favours have already procured them each a horse just waiting for them to return, and Techno’s fireworks shatter the enemy behind them as Philza checks the map, gets his bearings from the sky, charts them a path while already moving at a fast gallop. Hours later, once there is distance behind them, and Tommy is chattering on again - having shed the fierce focus he always dons during assignments - Philza looks around at these boys around him, his family, and clears his throat.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Only Wilbur hears him, but that’s enough - “Philza?” he says, and this gets the attention of Tommy and Techno. “Did you have -”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“The three of you are my family,” Philza says, matter-of-fact, “and I’m glad of it.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Wilbur’s eyes go wide and then soft. “Oh -”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“Well, of course,” Tommy says, and scoffs derisively. “Are you only just working this out now? You’re so old.”</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>“I suppose this means love is when you assassinate tyrants together, then,” Techno adds dryly. It is most likely meant to be a joke. Philza finds himself believing it true, and smiles a little to himself.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>They’re all war-forged and curious by nature - by the skies, they </span>
  <em>
    <span>met</span>
  </em>
  <span> on the battlefield - so Philza does not think he can be blamed for touching the strange crystal he finds in a cave, on one of his solitary missions, about a year later. He is thirty-two when his skin brushes the unearthly emerald for the first time. In some ways, he will be thirty-two until the world burns.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He will not learn this until some time later. The wings, though, he notices immediately.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There is no blood - they do not burst through his back like parasites, as wings are wont to do in the stories his soldiers tell around their fires - only a sudden weight, and he staggers, and then sensation bursts into his mind like a lightning bolt. Not pain, but awareness. All at once he has three times as much perception of the cool, slightly damp cave air; in less than a breath he is completely conscious of his body in space, of his </span>
  <em>
    <span>limbs</span>
  </em>
  <span> in space, of limbs where limbs should not be. There is tingling, and chills, like his feathers are adjusting to their own existence.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Philza glances over his shoulder to confirm his suspicions, blinks, shrugs - and then chuckles in delight as his new wings shrug too, one long wave of nonchalant movement starting in his shoulders and rippling out to the tips of his flight feathers. The wings, </span>
  <em>
    <span>his</span>
  </em>
  <span> wings, are strangely translucent - not as though they are not wholly solid, but as though they are not wholly </span>
  <em>
    <span>here.</span>
  </em>
  <span> He peers closer - it’s strangely easy to bend a wing around and understand how to move it, like he has had them his entire life - and sees the way the tips of the feathers pass straight through the stones on the cave floor.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Experimentally he moves one wing - prods at one of the stones - the ends of the feathers grow darker and more present before his eyes, and the stone rolls away, and with the job done the feathers fade back into translucency. As though they are his own secret. Philza considers this, practices the motion a few more times - he is nothing if not thorough - and then shrugs once more and heads back to his camp.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>When the wings are translucent to Philza, they are invisible to anyone else - and intangible, too, a fact which Wilbur delights in and Tommy finds insufferably annoying. Techno is the one to suggest a flight test; the four of them leave the camp for a day. They run away from the war that dragged them all here.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>(The point hasn’t been the war for a long time. The war is mostly pointless; at first, Philza fought it to support himself with the gold the generals paid him for his allegiance, and then he fought it because he’d ended up a general but he’d also found a teenager who the soldiers were calling a </span>
  <em>
    <span>blood god</span>
  </em>
  <span> and how much was that to place on someone so young, and Philza knew the feeling, and then he found Wilbur, too, who only wanted to make music, and Tommy, who was scrounging the camps for food before he was drafted into the cause, and then Philza couldn’t leave, of course he couldn’t - </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Anyway. The point has never been the war. Philza loves abandoning the war, possibly more than a general should.)</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The wings, Philza’s wings, are something like freedom; he’s never known a rush like the whoop that starts in his chest and bursts past his lips into the sky, never felt anything like wind through </span>
  <em>
    <span>his</span>
  </em>
  <span> feathers as he wheels above the forest for no eyes other than his family’s. The wings have to be present and solid for him to fly with them, which means anyone who sees him in the sky will see his feathers too - but on the ground, he can hide them if he wishes, and they trail through solid objects like ghosts. He makes a promise to himself, then: as long as no one but his family is present, he will never hide from them.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Tommy finds this impossibly cool, and demands Philza show them all the cave that brought this upon him. Unsurprisingly, the emerald has disappeared without a trace.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Four days later, Wilbur leaves, as he often does, to gather intelligence and rifle through his contacts and have his fun playing with the enemy psyche.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Ten days later, they get the news that Wilbur has been captured.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>The sheer delirious joy of flight is a thing of the past; Philza partitions time, now, into </span>
  <em>
    <span>before Wilbur was taken</span>
  </em>
  <span> and </span>
  <em>
    <span>after Wilbur was taken,</span>
  </em>
  <span> and he pretends not to notice the way Techno and Tommy do the same. They are a general, and a lieutenant, and a low-level soldier whose name people only know because Philza has taken a liking to him. The war effort falters when they turn all their attention on taking Wilbur back, but does not halt. Mostly it lets them go. </span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Family is the rage that slams into Philza’s chest like a blunt weapon when they find the note, something between a ransom and a set of terms for a hostage exchange. They disregard it. Family is the way they cannot think of anything other than </span>
  <em>
    <span>where is he,</span>
  </em>
  <span> and the way Techno has given up on the old creed of mercy he carried, and the way Tommy has not pretended to be anything other than angry for a very long time. Family is -</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Family is the way that he and Techno are wrenched in two when, another four days after the ransom note, Tommy disappears. It is the panic like nothing Philza has ever known when there is no trail to follow, and the enemy doesn’t even know who Tommy </span>
  <em>
    <span>is,</span>
  </em>
  <span> and his bedroll was still there when they woke up but Tommy himself was gone and there weren’t even any footsteps -</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>Family is Techno’s rage and Philza’s slow-warming fury. It is the way they refuse to separate, even when it would be the wiser choice, because neither of them can even contemplate breaking apart further.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>There is nothing of family in the way that Philza learns he cannot die, because this is the last axis of separation. He and Techno, run through with the same blade. One dead. The other left unmarked.</span>
</p>
<p>
  <span>He shows them his wings and he slaughters them all. They give him a name. He doesn’t care.</span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Years pass. </span>
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>
  <span>Philza doesn’t die. He never dies.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>It’s been ten years, and Philza doesn’t know how much he is supposed to have aged by now but he knows it is more than he has. He blames the crystal. The war is nations behind him now - here, he wanders in a land where no one has ever heard his name. His wings have carried him further than word has ever flown. Still, he’s a man of war by nature, and occasionally he lends his sword to causes; he tries to keep it to the just ones, like Tommy would have wanted. Doesn’t always manage; Techno would have understood.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He’s left his heart behind him, in a land no one he speaks to has ever heard of; one piece vanished, one piece executed, one piece six feet under a cairn of stones Philza constructed with shaking hands through a delirium of fury. Despite this, he likes to think of himself as relatively okay. It has been ten years. The seasons are teaching him perspective, even if he still wakes up wracked by vengeful anger, his nightmares calling him home. He dreams of the body he buried and the two he never even saw.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Until one night, he doesn’t. When he wakes, more well-rested than he has been in a decade, he thinks for a second that maybe he has finally healed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then a stick digs into his back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His senses scramble for alertness, and his sword is already in his hand, but - something stays his hand, part the knowledge that no one Philza didn’t trust would have gotten this close even in his sleep (as irrational as that is) and part sheer curiosity. Instead of the efficient motion that would behead whoever is crouched behind him, he rolls over as if still half-asleep. Squints blearily at the -</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The kid?</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>(This is where Philza splinters. Half of him thinks </span>
  <em>
    <span>My soul will know yours, always, and always has.</span>
  </em>
  <span> The other half thinks, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Who the fuck are you?)</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>“Why are you asleep in my forest, old man,” demands the kid, and he’s maybe eleven or twelve years old, and Philza is thoroughly muddled by his presence in a way he cannot explain. Something about the fall of the kid’s hair over his face - the cadence of his voice? - “Who are you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Philza stands. Then, when the kid balks, he crouches again so the two of them are eye-to-eye. “Who are </span>
  <em>
    <span>you?”</span>
  </em>
  <span> he says, quiet as he can bear to be, gentle - kids seem to like him, even if he’s always been a little ambivalent, a little cautious, a little too fucked-up to trust himself around them. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s a moment where the kid seems to startle, eyes going wide and then strangely calculating. Philza tilts his head, quizzical. The moment passes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’m just Will,” the kid says, and beams.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Philza’s chest is, suddenly, empty. His throat closes up. “That’s a good name,” he says, and it is a strangled eulogy.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Will lives in this forest, apparently, and he doesn’t have parents - Philza only gets a shrug, when he asks, and can never tease out anything more than nonchalance - and he hums to himself absent-mindedly when he’s gathering wood for their fire, whistles back at the birds, mumbles words under his breath late at night when he thinks Philza can’t hear him. Old habits claw their way out of their grave just to tear Philza’s lungs from his chest. Every time - </span>
  <em>
    <span>Be nice, Tommy, it’s not finished yet -</span>
  </em>
  <span> every fucking time Will spins a new melody out of nothing, at a rate that might be considered prodigal for a kid this young, Philza has to bite his tongue to keep the extra syllable from slipping through his lips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Will is not Wilbur, but his favourite colour is somewhere between blue and green even though he announces, with all the grave wisdom of an eleven-year-old, that obviously yellow is </span>
  <em>
    <span>his</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Will is not Wilbur, but as he trails behind Philza like a duckling he gives a story to every inanimate object they pass. (That stone a stolen son. That flower a martyred god. That leaf, that one there - </span>
  <em>
    <span>see it, Philza, that one’s me.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Philza feels as though he’s going to throw up.) </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Will is not Wilbur, but there was a song Wilbur never finished composing, this one wordless, complex, a kind of symphony he used to demand Techno and Tommy lend their voices to so that he could hear it as he wrote.</span>
  <em>
    <span> Techno, you hold that note - that’s it - listen, I just need to find the right progression through this part, don’t give me that look. Tommy, please.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Philza is surprised he still remembers. There is a scattering of notes towards the end of what Wilbur had written, cascading upwards into a final unfinished chord, frantic, frantic; Will is not Wilbur, but one evening, Philza comes back from a two-minute foray into the forest to check they aren’t being followed and finds Will humming the same passage. Note for note. He stumbles, at the end, and leaves it unfinished.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Philza clears his throat. Will, eleven-year-old Will with half-familiar eyes and a love for the colour yellow and music caught like a stolen thing in his scratchy young voice, whirls around like he’s been caught.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The guilty set to his jaw is the same. Philza knows - has known, in the core of his own chest, for some time now - but it still takes all his battle-earned control not to sway on his feet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Will is not Wilbur, but they clear their throat the same. And then Will starts talking, and says “Philza, I think you might need to sit down for this one, old man,” and everything begins making earth-shattering, wonderful sense.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It’s been - eleven years? twelve? - Philza has finally learned to stop counting, but Will is something like that old when he tells Philza to sit down and explains that actually, yes, he is </span>
  <em>
    <span>your dead bro - so - ah, your dead Wilbur, it’s been coming back in bits and pieces but I’m sure as fuck not a twelve-year-old kid and I can tell you exactly how we used to make our captives talk if you want me to prove who I am.</span>
  </em>
  <span> It should be unnerving to hear those words out of a kid’s mouth, but even though the face is soft the eyes are the same, fractal and sharp, a hundred different things like Wilbur always was. The timelines match up - Will, the child’s body, would have been born around the time that Philza lost everything he ever loved. (As you do.) Philza is very glad Will, Wilbur, told him to sit down when he did.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And then Wilbur arches an eyebrow that should be out of place on this face but is so natural Philza feels it in his chest like breathing, and says, “Does this mean you’ll stop hiding your wings finally? It was really fuckin weird, you walking around with them invisible. Like someone’d chopped off your leg.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Philza wants Will, this half-feral child he found in the forest with no parents and decided to keep, to stop talking about the bloodshed Philza has left far behind him in such matter-of-fact a tone; he wants to settle into sharp-tipped banter with Wilbur, one of his oldest friends, and not have to worry about hiding any part of himself. He wants, a little, to curl into a foetal position until things start making sense in a way that </span>
  <em>
    <span>doesn’t</span>
  </em>
  <span> feel like a supernova in his sternum. What he does is level a half-teary glare Wilbur’s way, and demand, “You waited this long to say anything </span>
  <em>
    <span>why?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur shrugs, maddeningly nonchalant. “I was a kid with torture know-how and way too much past all crammed into my brain, and I was also a man who was violently murdered all folded up and hidden away in a baby’s body, and then I got kind of used to having you around and also had no way of proving to myself, to kid-me, that I hadn’t made the entire story up. Like I, y’know - did a lot. It’s very validating to have you react like this, Philza, I’m not gonna lie to you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Philza blinks, and his wings stumble into this plane of existence like someone has cut a binding on them, and Wilbur grins back. A smile that says </span>
  <em>
    <span>hey, if anyone could think their way out of being dead it would be me,</span>
  </em>
  <span> and that has age and exhaustion written on it like an ancient text; one that belongs, still and somehow, to a child that is a second chance. Will is Wilbur, and Wilbur is Will, and over the days that follow they decide that Wil is both. Is a boy who remembers being a man, and a man who gets to be a boy again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There are lucid days and vaguer days. Philza is alight with a joy he has not felt since the last time he flew; he guards Will fiercely on the days he remembers less of how to protect himself. On the days Wilbur remembers more, Philza brings into the light old inside jokes that have gathered dust in the shut-away corners of his mind for more than a decade now, and laughs in a way that is a lantern through agony when there is someone who knows the punchline. He has been alone for so very long.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur grows, and remembers more, and comes into his own. Philza stays the same. They leave the forest, and walk the earth, and Philza grows accustomed to the idea that instead of having a quarter of a heart, he can function with half.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Then, another decade later, he and Wilbur are sitting in a room at an inn - reminiscing, quiet and gentle and tentative, about two names that are hard to say aloud. Philza’s wings are half-present, dark shadows, two quarters mantled. Wilbur is staring into the fire.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>This is the moment that Tommy falls straight through the ceiling in a billow of dark blue cloak and lands, with wide eyes and a panicked shout, right in the middle of the rug.</span>

  <p>
  <span>Philza’s flinch is towards his sword, and then he freezes in place - takes in the muted blond hair that tended towards a cowlick in the back, the necktie, the same stupid shoes Tommy would never give up no matter how many times Philza offered him better ones. The dark blue cloak - one of Techno’s, one that Tommy went to sleep wearing, that night. The night he - disappeared. Instead of disbelief, the sensation that slams into Philza first, utterly all-encompassing, is elation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He has gathered one of his boys home to him already, after all - defying death - so what’s a second time, but something that was meant to be?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur, across the room, has a look on his face like he’s a geode that has been shattered open, like there is a crevice in his mask, and it has exposed the crackled gems behind his eyes. It’s not a look Philza has seen on this face; it is one he knows, regardless. There is stunned joy there. Mistrust. An ache for vengeance and for family. Wilbur was already gone when Tommy vanished; regardless, he has lived as many years without Tommy as Philza has, though admittedly some of them were as a baby.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But Tommy is here. In an inn. Years on years on years later. And he is wearing the same old cloak of Techno’s as the day he disappeared.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Philza catches Wilbur’s eye - Wilbur gives him a warning glance, the one that used to mean </span>
  <em>
    <span>this could be a trap</span>
  </em>
  <span> and now just means </span>
  <em>
    <span>be cautious</span>
  </em>
  <span> - Philza throws caution to the wind, crosses the room in three strides, and goes to his knees at Tommy’s side.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy is very still - Philza feels a flicker of pride. Is startled that he still remembers, but - he used to teach Tommy to feign unconsciousness when in situations he didn’t know the full truth of - and yet Philza remembers Tommy’s tells, too, the way his fingers are twitching ever so slightly where his arm is splayed against the rug. Dimly he notes Wilbur is approaching too, with a little less wild abandon than was in Philza’s own steps. It’s difficult to care about anything more than the faint motion of Tommy’s breathing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey,” he says, gentling his voice; he is a creature made of desperate hope. “We can tell you’re faking, Tommy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And slowly, in a movement that is uncharacteristically hesitant of him (of course Philza remembers, of </span>
  <em>
    <span>course</span>
  </em>
  <span> he does), Tommy rolls over and opens his eyes.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>There’s silence for two or three seconds, an abyss that Philza’s stomach plummets into briefly; then Tommy shrieks, in that way he has, and it’s as though Philza has been absolved of years on years of guilt. “What the </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck,</span>
  </em>
  <span>” Tommy demands, “where are we,” and Philza’s chest is a monstera leaf, unfurling.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He grasps for words. Finds none. Wilbur, ever silvertongued, comes to his rescue. “Safe,” he says, crouching by Tommy’s other shoulder, “first of all. Safe, Toms, it’s - you’re - </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck.</span>
  </em>
  <span>” He looks to Philza, desperate.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Philza has no more ability to put words to this stunned undoing of grief than Wilbur does, can only call it flying for the first time - he tries his best to think of something else to say. “Tommy,” he begins, and - there is so little else to the moment, though. Only</span>
  <em>
    <span> Tommy, here, breathing.</span>
  </em>
  <span> “You - what happened, where have you been?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy squints at him, suspicious. “That’s a new sword,” he says, suspicious, and Philza glances down at it, startled - is it? He doesn’t remember - Tommy turns his head, now, and does a double-take at Wilbur. “Who the fuck are you?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tommy,” Philza says quickly, gentling his tone as best he can, pulling Tommy’s eyes back to him and away from the startled shattered look on Wilbur’s face. “What’s the last thing you remember?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy darts another uncomfortable glance at Wilbur. “Philza, who -”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“</span>
  <em>
    <span>Tommy</span>
  </em>
  <span> -”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I was going to sleep,” Tommy says, and his face darkens, almost imperceptibly. “We were going to get Wilbur back.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Philza swallows. Tries to think. “Then -”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then I woke up and I was falling out of the sky, wasn’t I,” Tommy snaps. His eyes are bright. “Philza, Philza, where -”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Where the </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck</span>
  </em>
  <span> do I start,” Philza says baldly. He’s not quite sure who he’s asking. “It’s -”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Twenty-three years,” Wilbur says. “Give or take.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Philza blinks. “How do you -”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I counted, obviously.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Will someone tell me who the fuck this is,” Tommy repeats, and jerks his chin back at Wilbur even as he’s scrambling to his feet.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Philza waits for Wilbur’s expression to break again, but is startled - instead of being hurt, Wilbur just grins like he’s waiting for Tommy to get it. Which is unfair, given that he is wearing an entirely different body and an entirely different life, and only remembers his previous incarnation due to some stroke of luck or error in the universe that -</span>
</p><p>
  <span>(Philza does not think about what will happen the next time around.)</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I’ll give you a hint, how about that,” Wilbur says around a too-gleeful smirk, rising from the floor to stand level with Tommy. He’s shorter in this body. Philza eyes the expression balefully - has seen it enough to know not to trust it. Will leans closer to Tommy, making a show of the conspiratorial whisper while only barely lowering his voice: “Remember that time we put lice in this - this </span>
  <em>
    <span>old man’s</span>
  </em>
  <span> bed and you called him Dadza by accident?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy’s face has always changed lightning-quick, like he’s in a hurry to get somewhere with his emotions. For an instant he is softly wistful, then it’s gone - replaced by shock, and then skepticism, and then the creeping edges of incredulous, unwilling understanding that he’s fighting away with tooth and nail and claw.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Philza says, startled, “That was </span>
  <em>
    <span>you?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“You were meant to fixate on the Dadza part,” Wilbur says, sounding miffed.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy’s voice cracks: “Wilbur?” he says, quiet and tentative, like he’s afraid the moment is going to shatter into pieces.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Sure is,” Wilbur says, and grins. “I stole a baby’s brain and now I live here.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“He was </span>
  <em>
    <span>reincarnated,</span>
  </em>
  <span>” Philza corrects hastily, “and somehow he - remembers.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But you’re -” Tommy begins, and then stops, and then goes visibly pale. </span>
  <em>
    <span>“Twenty-three years?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Give or take,” Philza says. His eyes land again on Tommy’s cloak.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Oh,” Tommy says, and sits heavily down with a thunk.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Miraculously, somehow, the three of them are happy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Granted - Tommy takes the years hard. And something about his presence - fresh from the war with wide eyes and Wilbur’s first death still fresh in his mind - brings out the old ghosts in Philza’s head, and the old shadows under Wilbur’s eyes, the ones he’d escaped in this body until now. It’s like Tommy has taken the cold rage he felt at losing Wilbur and simply repurposed it - now he doesn’t go a day without Techno’s name on his lips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He demands of Philza: </span>
  <em>
    <span>If Wilbur’s here</span>
  </em>
  <span> - somehow, somehow, his memory slipping through the cracks of a system of reincarnation that no one but he can even put words to - </span>
  <em>
    <span>and you’re here too,</span>
  </em>
  <span> not having aged a day, still cursed by that stupid fucking emerald and it’s only been a couple decades but Philza dreads the centuries looming on the horizon -</span>
  <em>
    <span> and I’ve showed up, out of nowhere, then what’s to say Techno hasn’t got something up his sleeve.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Tommy spits it in Philza’s face like a checkmate. Which it is, really, because Philza never has an answer; he changes the subject, or turns away, or swallows hard and refuses to meet Tommy’s eyes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>For Tommy, it’s been maybe a week since he saw Techno last. For Philza and Wilbur, it has been far longer - but both of them have long memories. And Tommy keeps it fresh in all their minds, an open wound.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Still.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Somehow, miraculously, the three of them are happy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Philza’s chest is three-quarters full with a heart, and their trio travels through glens and marshes and over plateaus, stands on the top of old, craggy hills. (Tommy informs Wilbur and Philza, solemnly, that the hill is almost Philza’s age.) They see the world. They are far enough away from the war that there is no fighting, and Philza’s battle instincts are dulled and Wilbur doesn’t keep careful track of peoples’ weaknesses any more and Tommy’s eyes stop cataloguing the exits when he walks into a room. Techno’s absence is more glaring now - the single missing piece - but Philza’s learning to live with it. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>To live without it, maybe.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He has practice. And he will need it, in the years to come. He’s more terrified of the future than he knows what to do with.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But he wakes up in the mornings to the sound of Tommy and Wilbur arguing, and knows the room is full, and his family is - for the most part - impossibly and wonderfully present. And Tommy talks Philza into letting him at his wings: an attempt, supposedly, at preening. Which is both a terrible decision - Philza winces at every dislodged feather - and a revelation. After a time, Wilbur, unwarrantedly hesitant, finds his way into the rotation of Helping With Philza’s Wings duty; it is a stunning sensation to have them cared for, gently and by clever hands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s around this time that Wilbur starts calling him</span>
  <em>
    <span> Phil,</span>
  </em>
  <span> to rhyme with the name he went by as this life’s version of a kid. Phil and Will. Philza turns the name over in his head a couple of times, shrugs, and decides he’s keeping it.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy insists, adamantly, that his name is Philza and it’s blatant disrespect to refer to him any other way, </span>
  <em>
    <span>Wilbur, you absolute bitch.</span>
  </em>
  <span> (He’s teasing, of course.) The first time Tommy calls him Phil comes a week after the first time Wilbur does it, and Phil - can hide his human tells, but it’s been a long time since he has had his wings visible more often than not (Tommy gets mutinous if he hides them), and he can’t hide the way they fluff a little, protective, soft, soft, soft.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Don’t patronise me,” Tommy snaps at Phil’s feathers. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil chuckles. “They don’t have their own minds, mate,” he says, and then regrets it when Tommy turns the scowl towards his face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The next morning, their campsite is startlingly silent.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil’s stomach drops, like a stone, or something with its wings cut mid-flight. Dead weight plummeting towards the earth.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Family is the way there are no tracks. Family is the way there is no trail to follow. Family is the way that, for the second time, Tommy has disappeared into absolutely nothing, tripping sideways into - a different time, maybe.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil doesn’t know. He hates not knowing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur insists, eyes bright with furious fervour, that Tommy will show up again in the future. That if they wait, they will find him. </span>
  <em>
    <span>It’s happened once,</span>
  </em>
  <span> he points out, every part of his body inclined forwards with the strength of his belief, </span>
  <em>
    <span>and it will happen again.</span>
  </em>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Be that as it may, Phil is on half a heart again. He can’t die, but it stings.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Their camp is colder, bigger, without Tommy there to fill the silence and the space.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And Wilbur has a mortal lifespan. His rattling breath stains Phil’s dreams for fifty years, a hundred, for more than that; he dies like a mortal, too. </span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>Phil doesn’t know if those stolen years - three quarters full, for the most part daring to be happy - were a fluke.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The years seem to speed up without family around to slow their passing; before he knows it he is impossibly old, his immortality beyond the region of reasonable doubt, and the knowledge doesn’t prick his chest like he thought it would. It’s difficult to care about much at this point, really. He waits a human lifespan - hoping, desperately, that Wilbur will find his way home again - and then another, and another.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Either Wilbur didn’t remember - that first reincarnation an honest fluke, or maybe Wilbur had the pure bloody-minded determination to yank his own memories through death once but did not have the strength to do it again - either Wilbur did not remember, or he remembers but Phil is nowhere to be found (or has failed to find Wilbur). And Phil does not know which is worse. If Wilbur is somewhere out there - waiting, remembering - does he think himself crazy? Is he a child, an adult, an old man? Has he died young? Do his faces still emulate the one that Phil remembers, in the same way that Will’s did, ever so slightly: indisputably different, but with features the same, recognisable if one is looking for them? Is his head too full of memories that were not his own? Does he think his family is imagined; does he still think of them as his family?</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He gets real poetic when he’s spiralling. Wilbur would be fucking proud.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And Tommy’s nowhere to be found - Phil half-hopes for maybe fifty years that tomorrow will be the day a quarter of his heart stumbles sideways into this time period and calls him an old man. After enough time, though, he gives up.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>That’s not quite true. He doesn’t give up. He’s desperate, and logically he knows that after long enough he will probably have other families - that this one was not unique. But deep in his chest, he is furious - knows that this is where his heart is, buried thrice over, and it’s not like he’s fucking getting it back.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He doesn’t give up. But he does give up hoping.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Suffice it to say: he’s not doing super fantastic, just in general. He falls back into old habits like donning an old piece of familiar armour: offer your services, play mercenary, win a few wars if you aren’t feeling great. Maybe you’ll acquire a family along the way. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He doesn’t. There are kids he likes, friends he gets on well enough with. It is not the same thing. Sure, he’d kill for the children he takes under his wing (more literally than they know; his feathers are not for others to see, they’re for his family, and if that means not flying until he’s alone then so be it), but they are not Tommy. Sure, he’d take blades and arrows and weapons that grow sharper and sharper over the centuries for the strategists he has interesting conversations with or the effortlessly charismatic officials who put him in mind of half-remembered melodies, but they are not Wilbur, and they are not Techno, and though his chest hurts less he is still conscious of how empty it is.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>On the worse days, he reminds the enemy side - who is his enemy in nothing but technicality, for no reason other than Phil is a bitter immortal who needs a murderous fucking outlet sometimes - he reminds them that magic still exists in this world if he is angry enough.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They call up old names. Ones he has never claimed, but that have always been thrown upon him, ill-fitting mantles. </span>
  <em>
    <span>Angel of death. The scythe you don’t see coming. </span>
  </em>
  <span>Phil shrugs them away like so much tainted grain, and yet -</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Something about these titles, the ones given to Phil by his own side and the other one alike, inspire other gods to be invoked.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There is another set of names on the soldiers’ lips.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It chills Phil’s blood to hear.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>And he doesn’t want to think it could possibly be - because that was hundreds of years ago, and surely forgotten now, and - he doesn’t want to hope, because it really is a very generic archetype for a god. “Blood” is hardly specific. Hardly unexpected, when one is fighting a war. But the chants are the same, and the prayers that Phil hears when he flares his wings are the same, even if they are a plea for protection against Phil rather than from his ally now, and - </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He doesn’t hope. Not quite. It never blossoms into full hope, never becomes a thriving hope in his chest that could one day pay off, a hope that could yield a heart as fruit. But the seeds of it are there.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil should know better, he really should.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>But if Wilbur could remember his name once, impossibly, then why should the world not remember Techno’s? If Tommy could stumble his way into the future, why could Techno’s legacy not do the same? If the others of Phil’s family could come home -</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>No. He’s done this before. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>He ignores the seeds of hope that thrill in his chest. Plucks out the shoots, like a weed.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>And then.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>And then.</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>He wakes, bleary, in a tent in the middle of the night, and knows irrevocably that something is different. Something around him has changed, or woken him. He can’t put his finger on what it is, but in barely a moment he’s so awake that he can hear the faint rustling of the insects outside, the murmurs of soldiers in other tents in the camp, the sound of his own breathing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Then - a footstep. One that might as well be a thunderclap for the chord it strikes in his chest. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil rises to his feet, heart thundering with an anticipation he shouldn’t be entertaining. He’s making something out of nothing; he’s hoping too much; maybe he’s still dreaming, and this is an invention of his half-asleep mind. He clutches his wings to him, translucent but still warm enough to give him comfort. His sword is within his reach, but he leaves it lying where it is against his better judgment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>There’s another footstep. Phil watches the entrance to the tent with eagle-sharp eyes. When the layer of fabric is pulled away, he’s glad he didn’t take up his sword; he would’ve dropped it, and that’s never good for the blade.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy is standing there, in the entrance to the tent. It’s dark outside, but he is holding a strange torch that does not flicker. Phil is stunned, but Tommy doesn’t even seem startled to see him here.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Hey Philza Minecraft,” he chirps, and ducks into the tent. Phil is caught off-guard by the surname - not one he knows or recognises. “How long’s it been?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil’s voice, when he speaks, surprises both of them with its raspiness. “Two hundred years,” he offers, “give or take,” and Tommy narrows his eyes, giving him a weird look.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How fucking far did I jump, then,” Tommy says, and shines the strange torch around the tent. “Is that a </span>
  <em>
    <span>sword?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yes,” Phil says, for want of anything productive to offer to the conversation.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Huh,” Tommy says, and turns the light in Phil’s eyes; he squints, half blinded by it. “How - wait, what year is it?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I - I don’t know?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Wow, thanks for all the help, bitch,” Tommy says, and lowers the light. Phil drops to the ground for want of a bed to fall onto, with a thunk. Meanwhile Tommy scurries around the tent, taking in the details. He chatters as he does so. “I found Wilbur again this time,” he informs Phil, matter-of-fact like he hasn’t turned Phil’s entire worldview upside down in the last five minutes, “he’s being a Hamilton kinnie, it’s disgusting. And like, you’re there, you’re Philza Minecraft, but it’s the time before me or Wilbur have blown up so I can’t exactly get you to notice me, which is very annoying and personally offensive actually. You’re so horrible, Phil. You’re the worst friend.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil says, hoarse and strangled, “I thought you were dead, Tommy.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It makes Tommy draw up short. “Surely you know better than that, Philza Minecraft,” he scoffs, but there’s a creeping worry in his voice that Phil can still remember how to recognise, even after all these years. “What, when was the last time you saw me? I mean, of course you missed me, I am just - so amazing, but -”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You disappeared,” Phil says, “and then you appeared, again, thirty years later, and then vanished for a second time. I haven’t seen you or Wilbur since.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Well shit,” Tommy says. He shifts his weight from foot to foot.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Tommy -” Phil’s voice cracks. Again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I didn’t plan on </span>
  <em>
    <span>emotional labour</span>
  </em>
  <span> today,” Tommy says, “what the fuck?” He crosses the room in one terrifyingly quick motion, slams into Phil with enough force that it winds him, and is wrapping Phil in a hug like he hasn’t felt in years.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He holds Tommy back, not daring to hope and not daring to breathe and not daring to hug too tight in case something breaks again, and gives an incredulous, stunned laugh. “What the </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck,</span>
  </em>
  <span>” he says, “is a </span>
  <em>
    <span>kinnie?”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“You with Urahara from Bl - Um. Nothing.” Tommy coughs. “Anyway.”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Here is how things pan out, once Phil is able to convince himself he is not dreaming:</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy is a time traveller. He has been doing it for years, and not in linear order, either - sometimes he jumps back, sometimes forwards. Sometimes he stays in one place for ten minutes and sometimes for many months. He’s learning to control certain aspects of it, and it’s easier to keep to one place when Phil or Wilbur is around, but there’s always times it startles him. Like now, for instance. Apparently this jump was an accident.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I just hope I can get back to like, 2016 or something,” Tommy says. “I have a Youtube channel now, Phil, everyone loves me so much when they don’t find me annoying.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil is learning to ignore every time Tommy mentions something that makes no sense to him; it’s easier than making him explain. “And Will remembers,” he says again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Every time, yeah,” Tommy says nonchalantly. Phil </span>
  <em>
    <span>thinks</span>
  </em>
  <span> he’s putting up the casual air as a front, because he’s scared of messing something irrevocably up, but it’s harder to tell - this is an older Tommy than the one he knew, and there are new mannerisms and new favourite words and a new, startling ability to hide his emotions from even Phil. “I’ve told you this, old man - wait, no, you’re </span>
  <em>
    <span>so young,</span>
  </em>
  <span> what the fuck.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What,” Phil says. He is older than any living human.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can’t even bully you about burning down Alexandria by accident yet,” Tommy says, sounding genuinely crestfallen.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil doesn’t even know where to start with that one, so he just lets it pass. “But,” he asks, working slowly through his list of questions, “you’ve - never met Techno?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy’s face darkens, almost imperceptibly. “No. But - No.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“But?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Why’ve you got your wings all hidden and shit,” Tommy demands.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It’s an obvious attempt to change the subject; Phil draws his wings into physical form, looks Tommy in the eye and says, calmly, “But?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“God, you just never forget how to do that, do you,” Tommy mutters. He looks away, swallows, and says, “But his name always shows up, somehow. Even on fucking Minecraft servers. Like, I go on Hypixel and - Nothing comes up if you search for Technoblade, I’ve </span>
  <em>
    <span>checked,</span>
  </em>
  <span> he’s not anyone. But people are always spamming </span>
  <em>
    <span>Blood for the -</span>
  </em>
  <span>”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“- blood god,” Phil finishes, his heart in his throat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy sniffs. “Yeah. Kinda annoying, if you ask me.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Do you think it’s anything to do with -”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“It’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>always there,</span>
  </em>
  <span> Phil, you don’t get it,” Tommy interrupts. “Every single time I jump to. I don’t ever make a jump without hearing it. Somewhere, someone always says it. So - Techno’s not </span>
  <em>
    <span>over.</span>
  </em>
  <span> I’m not letting him be.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil knows the bitter stubborn feeling, as much as he would like to pretend he doesn’t. So he only gives a nod and a quiet hum of affirmation, turns his attention back to the ground at his feet, and takes a deep breath.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>A moment later, he adds, “Tommy, put the sword down, please.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Aww,” Tommy complains, and Phil can’t contain the smile that fights its way onto his face.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It’s delirious, this knowledge. Giddy, and gleeful, and three-quarters euphoric. Phil knows it will be easier to wait, now, secure in the knowledge that - as long as it may take - he won’t be on his own forever. Three out of his family of four have sidestepped the natural human boundaries of death, somehow, impossibly, and sooner or later one of them will show up. Tommy will fall out of the sky. Wilbur will find him, as a child who remembers being an adult or an adult who remembers being forty different people, and the cycle will repeat. Techno will -</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno is -</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno is not </span>
  <em>
    <span>gone.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Phil thinks he’s allowed to be a little stubborn in his belief, this time: if three of the four of them have stumbled out of their first lives into the future, Techno will find a way, too. And yet Tommy has seen thousands of years in the future,</span>
  <em>
    <span> this</span>
  </em>
  <span> Tommy has, the one who Phil can glance over and see breathing and gesturing, the one whose chatter fills the silence Phil has grown to hate; Tommy has seen the future and Techno is never there in person.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>His name is omnipresent, though. Phil gives up on the war he hasn’t even been paying proper attention to, and he and Tommy travel, and he hears it in a play a thousand miles away from any battlefront. He hears </span>
  <em>
    <span>blood for the blood god </span>
  </em>
  <span>in stories, tall tales, fables. When he asks about the phrase’s history, he gets weird looks and shrugs in return.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It keeps the wound fresh. Phil has a long memory.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He asks how he and Tommy will find wherever Wilbur is in this life, and receives only a shrug in return; “Either he finds us or he doesn’t,” Tommy says, “but it’s tough to go looking, y’know. He gravitates towards us if we stay in one place long enough. Searching only makes it take longer.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Then we need to stop moving,” Phil says, appalled.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“No, we just need to go about our lives,” Tommy corrects him, a startling solemnity to his eyes; for a long moment, he seems as old as Phil. Older, even. Phil has never quite asked how he ages. Then the moment breaks and Tommy’s somewhere between fourteen and seventeen again, strangely ageless but indisputably young; he gives Phil a grin, points to the horizon and exclaims that that cow is now his property.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What the fuck is </span>
  <em>
    <span>hippity hoppity,</span>
  </em>
  <span>” Phil demands, and receives only shrieking laughter for an answer.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Techno’s titles haunt them. His epithets are inescapable. Phil outgrows his own names, but Techno’s follow him through years and empires and oceans.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He settles in for the long haul.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy and Wilbur come and go. That’s okay. They will always come back. Phil lives for them, and he lives for himself, and, somewhere underneath, he knows he’s waiting for Techno to come home too.</span>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>The years pass easier with three-quarters of a family to live them with.</p><p>Tommy appears and disappears seemingly at random - out of order, for indeterminate lengths of time, but always with the same brightness to his eyes. Always the same wheezing laughter. Phil gives advice on things in the future and the past that he really is not qualified to give advice on, and occasionally baffles his co-contemporaries with relics that Tommy shows up just to give him and disappears a moment later. Nail polish, which he fucks up awfully - in his defense, it hasn’t been invented yet. A sword that’s older than any historians can name, which is very funny when he throws it into a lake in Scotland and leaves them all wondering about King Arthur. The years march onwards, soldier-like; Phil’s long past being a soldier.</p><p>Not always, but more often than he doesn’t, he manages to find Wilbur. Holding his family as they die never gets easier, but it does get mildly less traumatic when he knows Wilbur, at least, will find him again, somewhere, sometime, somehow - a different face, sometimes a different height or birth sex (always a man, though - that doesn’t change), generally a different name in legality if not in his own mind. But always the same memory, and the same wit, and the same music. Wilbur has a propensity towards libraries, and stories, and recording history as best he can; he insists it’s not because it annoys him when people get it wrong, but Phil knows better. It’s a pet peeve. In Wilbur’s defense, he has thousands of lifespans’ worth of memories rattling around in one mind, generally from a young age (he gets called a prodigy more often than not, and Phil’s pretty sure it’s gone to his head) - he is allowed a pet peeve or two, if he so desires.</p><p>And the blood god, always the blood god, dogged in Phil’s footsteps. It stings whenever he hears it - he walks out of inns if a bard dares to speak it, and later he leaves the city if it’s written in a newspaper somewhere, and later still he demands his Twitch chat stop spamming it since it doesn’t even <em> mean </em> anything, no one will tell him what it means. He knows perfectly well that it could not be Technoblade. Many people have been called gods of bloodshed. But - if the three of them have clawed their way into the future, somehow still managing to find each other - there’s no reason there can’t be a fourth.</p><p>Often it’s two of them. Sometimes it’s three of them. But that’s the most it ever is - Phil thinks, once, <em> 3/4 curse, </em> and then snorts, not sure where that one came from. The years weather his grief, smooth the rough edges to gentleness, but it is always a weight. It is always present. Thousands of years later, he <em> still </em>catches himself glancing over his shoulder in the hopes that there will be a flash of pink in his periphery.</p><p>This is the other reason he is certain Techno will find his way home: he has not forgotten.</p><p>Phil has a long, long memory, surely augmented by that emerald since no unaltered mind would be able to remember this much; despite that, years still blur the faces of old friends, even the ones he was close to. He remembers very little else from that first fateful war, the one where he found his family. And yet - Techno’s face, amongst the blurriness, is still clear as day. He still remembers the exact shape of Techno’s self-deprecatory smirk, the faint glint in his eye at a job well done. He still remembers the cautious, cautious touch of a hand on one of his wings, that very first day.</p><p>Phil, Philza, does not forget.</p><p>But he lives on.</p><p> </p><p>He doesn’t die. He never dies.</p><p> </p><p>… He quite likes this Twitch thing, though.</p><p> </p><p>Ironically enough, Tommy drags him into streaming not long after they stumble over Wilbur again - or, rather, Wilbur stumbles into them, nearly runs Phil over with his car, and then proceeds to drop everything so that he and Tommy can move in together, somewhere not far from Phil's current residence. Once Tommy's put the idea of clout-chasing into Wilbur's head, too - incorrigible - Wilbur takes like a duck to water to performing in front of thousands of people (the numbers seem to grow every day), building songs with modern lyrics around melodies he’s been constructing for thousands of years, not because they’re his favourites but because he knows Phil knows them all by heart.</p><p>Then Tommy disappears - only to pop up again about a month later for Phil, but years and years later for Tommy (it hurts his brain a little). After <em>that,</em> though, it’s one of the rare epochs of the three of them, and one of Phil’s favourites yet. He remembers Tommy calling him <em> Philza Minecraft </em> at barely three hundred years old, remembers his own utter confusion, and feels only fondness now.</p><p>It’s one of the quieter nights, where he’s alone with tea rather than alone with thousands of viewers, that it happens. Phil isn’t expecting a package or anything, but he knows it’s only polite to answer the door when he hears a knock. These days he has been leaving his wings visible when he’s alone, secure in the knowledge that the only people who might barge in on him are the ones who have known about the wings for who fucking knows how long; he shifts them sideways, into what he’s started thinking might be a parallel dimension or a separate layer of reality, and double- and triple-checks they’re invisible before he goes to see who’s at the door.</p><p>Could be one of those ding-dong-ditch things, maybe. He’s half expecting to open it to an empty doorstep.</p><p>Which is why he’s left utterly unprepared when he fumbles with the doorknob with one hand, holding his mug of tea in the other, and looks up with a self-deprecating smile to see a face that is brilliant in his mind, as clear a memory as memory itself, something that slams into his gut so hard it’s like the battering rams of old. The ones he remembers wielding. The mug tumbles to the doorstep and shatters, and Phil, Philza, doesn’t care. Can’t. His entire mind is frozen still; his entire soul is screaming at him to reach out, to step forwards, to come home.</p><p>“Hi,” says Technoblade, and ducks his head. “Really sorry about the mug.”</p><p>The stars are shattering above them, surely, and Phil’s heart has all four quarters for the first time in thousands of years, and Techno is worried about the mug. Somehow, through the blind shock that is Phil’s entire body, he manages to say - choke out, really - “Fucking typical.”</p><p>Techno is bloodstained and battered and brilliantly, brilliantly alive. He is clad in armour. A sword hangs at his side. “Please let me in,” he says, and Phil <em> delights, </em> with a joy made only fiercer by the terror that runs its shadow, that he can still read the cadences of Techno’s voice like so many characters of a rudimentary writing system. “Philza, please, they won’t stop saying E -”</p><p>This, somehow, is startling enough that it kicks Philza back into motion. “What the fuck are you on about,” he says, loving, incredulous, and holds the door open wider. “Come <em> in, </em> holy fuck, I - <em> Techno </em>-”</p><p>“But the mug,” Techno says, somehow apologetic for <em> this, </em> and he looks down at it with an expression that could be disdain but Philza knows is genuine guilt. Then, with a shimmer, the mug and the spilt tea are gone.</p><p>“What the actual fuck,” Philza says; apparently this is the last straw for him, after thousands of years of being alive. A disappearing mug. Well, he had a good run.</p><p><em> Blood god, </em> scream the stars and the doorknob and the vanished tea stains, and Phil looks between the door and his oldest friend. “Please come in, Jesus Christ,” he beseeches. “It’s too fucking cold to be doing this on the doorstep.”</p><p>“Wimp,” Techno says.</p><p>Phil watches, heart healed and full and in his throat, as - in a motion that is thousands of years in the making - Techno finally, <em> finally </em> crosses the threshold.</p>

<div class="userstuff">
  <p>
  <span>Philza has lost count of his age at the moment that Technoblade comes home; this matters very little to him. His family has shown up, at long last, out of the blue. He knows where every one of them is.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Surely, the first matter of business should be how Techno is alive, but - it really would be rather hypocritical of Phil to get on his ass about it, so he just leads Techno into his kitchen and goes to put the kettle on. Sitting on the kitchen table, in pristine condition, is the mug - full of tea - that Phil dropped when he saw Techno’s face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The two of them balk at it. Techno says, deadpan, “Well, that’s new.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil stares at the mug for a long moment, returns to his quest - a second mug of tea for Techno - with a sturdy determination that would make any general proud, and says, voice shaking, “What’s the last thing you remember?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Dying in your arms,” Techno says, like he’s talking about the weather. His face is a still mask. Phil knows all his tells, remembers them clearly, and immediately abandons the kettle to go to Techno and wrap him in a hug; his wings stumble into this dimension almost by accident, as frantic as the rest of Phil to prove to themselves that Techno is real and present, and for a long moment the two of them stand there. Frozen. Impossible. Embracing.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Finally, Techno - who is shivering, Phil notices - coughs. Draws away. “Is it really cold here,” he says, “or is that just me?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Nah, it’s like the fucking Antarctic when I forget to put the heating on,” Phil says, a practiced quip. Something about the mundanity of the moment - complaining about his icebox flat with Technoblade - gets to him; he has to blink, hard, and even that doesn’t quite dissuade the tears.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You missed me, huh,” Techno observes.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil snorts. “What gave it away?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The tea’s good. The house warms, slowly, once Phil gets up to turn on the central heating. The two of them sit there for a long time in silence, but it shouldn’t be surprising that even after all these years, they’re still in sync enough that they speak at the same moment.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“What were you saying about E -”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“How long has it -”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You first,” Phil says, and ducks his head, feels his wings jitter, antsy, behind him.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno shifts in his chair. It’s a strange, strange juxtaposition, the armour and the kitchen stool. “How long has it been,” he says. “For you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil takes a deep breath. “Longer than I would’ve liked,” he admits, and clears his throat, and begins what Tommy will later dub episode 1 of the Philza Minecraft Recaps World History For Techno Show. His voice is hoarse by the time the night is out.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>It’s four in the morning, and they’re still sitting in the kitchen, when Techno says, quietly, “So does that mean you can - send a message, to Wilbur? To Tommy?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil’s glad the mug is on the table - he couldn’t bear to lose it twice. “I fucking forgot,” he says, and then “</span>
  <em>
    <span>yes,</span>
  </em>
  <span> should’ve - fuuuucking hell,” and he jumps up from his seat, makes a beeline for his PC before remembering he could’ve just pulled out his phone, and is clicking the call button on Discord before he can do anything stupid like thinking it through.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Startlingly enough, both Wilbur and Tommy are online and present enough to answer immediately. Phil makes a mental note to bring that up later. For now, Wilbur loads in first with his slightly better PC and makes a distressed sound the second he sees Phil’s face.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You look like shit,” he says bluntly. “What, you been crying? What’s going on?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil blinks at his monitor, has several intense regrets, and says “Where the </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck</span>
  </em>
  <span> do I start.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I can come over there and punt them for you,” Tommy offers. He sounds dead serious; it’s four in the morning and his and Wilbur’s apartment is a ten minute walk through the snow and freezing cold and he’s offering to punt some imaginary offender. Phil swallows around the lump in his throat. Doesn’t know why he’s surprised. All of them have walked through worse than snow for each other.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s a fucking terrible idea,” he says anyway. He glances towards the door. Techno is hovering outside it and - luckily, or maybe unluckily - outside of the camera’s frame, with a wary hesitance to his movements but a brilliant light in his eyes that Phil can only assume was sparked by the sound of Wilbur’s voice.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Who’re you looking at,” Wilbur says sharply, right on cue.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“I actually have no clue how to explain this,” Phil says, and then gives a sharp </span>
  <em>
    <span>fuck it </span>
  </em>
  <span>laugh, “so I’m just - not gonna - Hey. Hey, mate,” he holds a hand out to Techno, “you come in here and then they can see you.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno shuffles slowly into the room - he’s wearing some of Phil’s pyjamas, after they worked together to free him from his armour at about two in the morning - and squints at the screen. Phil feels a gleeful swoop in his chest, a little mean maybe, at the plain uncomplicated </span>
  <em>
    <span>shock</span>
  </em>
  <span> on Wilbur’s and Tommy’s faces, in 1080 and 780p respectively.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Tommy is the one who reacts first - jumps, frameratey, up from his seat and just straight-up </span>
  <em>
    <span>leaves.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Phil doesn’t doubt that he’s planning on sprinting the distance between their houses - he’s made it in four minutes in snow before, to all of their chagrin. Wilbur sits frozen for another moment, but something seems to startle him out of his reverie - maybe the sound of the door slamming as Tommy leaves - and then he says, low and intent, “Phil, is this -”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Phil says, giddy.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“And he’s -”</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>“Yeah.”</span>
  </em>
</p><p>
  <span>“If I drive I bet I can beat Tommy there,” Wilbur says, and then he’s leaving the call, and Phil and Techno are left staring at Tommy’s empty room before Phil closes out of Discord and puts a hand, tentative, on Techno’s shoulder.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“You okay?” he says, gentle.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Yeah,” Techno agrees. He seems incredibly fascinated by Phil’s PC. “This is real-time -?”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Uh.” They’re talking about the computer, apparently. “Yeah.”</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“That’s </span>
  <em>
    <span>incredible,</span>
  </em>
  <span>” Techno says, sounding enamoured. “How does it -”</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Tommy gets there first, heralded by his knocking loudly and continuously on the door before seeming to remember belatedly that he has a key. Techno sweeps towards the door the moment there’s a sound, moving with all the battle-grace he ever wore and not hesitating as he navigates Phil’s flat effortlessly, and Phil watches him go while still feeling slightly stunned about the entire thing. When he’s put-together enough to actually think, he gets up himself, follows them, and comes across all three of them - Techno, Tommy, Wilbur - huddled together on the floor, in varying states of disarray.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur, unabashed, is crying. Tommy’s not much better. Techno’s eyes are dry, but his shoulders are shaking. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>“Techno resurrection arc pog,” Phil says, to announce his own presence. Wilbur - the closest - looks up, grabs his ankle hard enough to upset his balance, and yanks him mercilessly into the cuddle pile.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil can’t say he’s opposed. It is a staggering thing, to have Techno tangible again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The four of them (</span>
  <em>
    <span>four,</span>
  </em>
  <span> sings Philza’s chest, and </span>
  <em>
    <span>four,</span>

  <span> blaze the stars) stay there until eight in the morning, silent at first before devolving into breathless, hushed conversation like none of them can quite believe this is real. Techno, somehow, is the least affected. Instead of spending thousands of years grieving, after all, he’s had one (1) mildly traumatic death (Wilbur scoffs, before Phil gives him a quelling look), a long time in a dim dark purgatory that was filled with voices and </span>
  <em>
    <span>blood god</span>
  </em>
  <span> and nothing much else, and then been deposited directly outside Phil’s front door with a head full of muttering (“like a stream chat but it’s your brain,” Tommy says) that tells him exactly who and where he is. The rest of them alternate between disbelieving and feeling strangely normal - lulled by the familiarity that’s been thousands of years in the making. </span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>By the end of the week, Techno has learned to play Bedwars. By the end of the second week, he can beat any of the three of them without actually having to pay attention.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>He only vanishes the PC once, but it reappears in the other flat, completely unharmed with Minecraft still running. Apparently - according to the voices in Techno’s head, now dubbed Technochat by a Tommy who seems very determined to insist that everything is normal - Techno has been drawn out of death to serve their purpose, to glorify their name, to bring them blood. He has no real intention of complying. Strangely enough, this leaves him a relatively normal human, if one disregards the thousands of voices in his head whispering prophecy and giving him quests, and also the tendency to vanish things that irritate him if he’s not being careful.</span>
</p><p>
  <em>
    <span>Normal enough, if one disregards the fact that they’re even here</span>
  </em>
  <span> is actually a descriptor that sums up all four of them fairly neatly, so all of them let the blood god thing slide.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>The first time Phil really, truly </span>
  <em>
    <span>understands</span>
  </em>
  <span> that they are four again is also the first time he almost forgets it - not that they are four, but that they ever weren’t. At the moment their living arrangements are technically a fifty-fifty split across the two houses they have between the four of them - Tommy and Wilbur in one apartment, and Techno and Phil in the other flat - but in practice they tend to all gravitate towards the same place unless they’re streaming and need their setups (a practice Techno has taken great interest in). This means that the mornings, once again, are full of sound.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The first time Phil really, truly understands that they are four again is a lazy Friday morning. Tommy isn’t in school since he doesn’t technically, legally exist, and Wilbur quit his day job not long ago to focus on streaming, so none of them have anywhere to be. Phil wakes to the smell of burning bacon and Techno’s mock-offended shouts, and for a minute he completely forgets that Techno being present is new and wonderful and impossible. </span>
  <em>
    <span>I should be getting up,</span>
  </em>
  <span> he thinks, </span>
  <em>
    <span>stop Tommy burning the house down</span>
  </em>
  <span>. Of course he can easily infer that that’s who’s trying to cook, and when he ambles into the kitchen it’s pleasing to be proved right: Wilbur has confiscated the pan, as though he’s any better an option to be trusted with it, while Techno has Tommy in some kind of headlock.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Phil looks at them all for a long moment - forgets, somehow, that these are a time-traveller and a blood god and a man who remembers all his selves - and clears his throat.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>The guilty looks on their faces are priceless.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>It hits Phil then, and only then, that this is a privilege to wake up to. That Techno’s presence, which is so natural and right that he has forgotten its novelty, is something he’s lived eras without. But this time, the lump in his throat is something he can swallow past.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>“The fuck have I just walked into,” he says, and Wilbur immediately begins talking, rapid-fire and full of excuses, and Philza can’t stop grinning.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>(Years pass, all tentative and terrifying because every one of them knows the next morning could be the one where it all comes tumbling down, and yet - Tommy doesn’t vanish.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Wilbur doesn’t age.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Techno never dies. Not again.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>Something has shifted in all of them, irrevocable, now that they’re whole.)</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Funny enough, Techno does get into streaming. He also gets into the whole “blood god” thing. Apparently it’s easier to keep the murderous voices at bay when he’s framing them as fictional and bullying them mercilessly in front of thousands of people; the inverse of that, just as effective, is that somehow, somehow, the ancient voices have not yet worked out that deaths earned in the revered arena of Bedwars are not deaths with any real consequence. If they get too loud, Techno just turns on Phil’s PC at three in the morning and utterly obliterates some children at the game. The voices are very pleased that he’s murdering orphans in their name. Blood for the blood god, and all that.</span>
</p><p> </p><p>
  <span>Family is </span>
  <em>
    <span>this.</span>
  </em>
  <span> Family is something they’ve fought for. Family is the terror at losing each other again, and the unmatched elation at opening the door to see someone you thought was out of your reach sitting at the kitchen table eating toast. Family is them teasing Techno for his vowels - apparently whatever translation matrix is providing him with the ability to speak modern English has decided to make him American - and family is the way they drag him into what Wilbur likes to joke is the family business, playing Minecraft on stream, even though there are several other more significant similarities between the four of them. Family is not something that ever conforms to expectations. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>Family is one winged immortal, a time-travelling kid who’s stuck living time in the right order for the first time since he was fourteen, a man who has a memory too long for his bones and who has never quite been able to belong, and a recently resurrected soldier who has a blood god living in his head and prayers in his name and iffy godly powers that show their faces at the weirdest moments and never when it’s convenient - and that’s okay.</span>
</p><p>
  <span>They can make this work. </span>
</p><p>
  <span>They all got here, after all, and now they are finally home.</span>
